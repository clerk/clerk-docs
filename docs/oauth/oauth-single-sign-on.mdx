title: Use OAuth for single sign-on
description: Learn how to implement single sign-on with OAuth in your Clerk application or when signing into a third-party app.

Clerk supports two primary single sign-on (SSO) scenarios using OAuth: 

- Sign users into your Clerk app using social providers
- Enable sign-in to third-party apps using Clerk as an Identity Provider (IdP)

These two flows help you streamline authentication for your users, whether they're signing into your Clerk-powered app or accessing external applications with Clerk credentials. This guide covers both scenarios in detail and provides links to additional resources where applicable.

## Let users authenticate into your Clerk app with social providers

This flow allows users to authenticate into your Clerk app using popular providers such as Google, Facebook, or Github. Clerk handles the OAuth flow and user provisioning, so you can focus on building your application.

Refer to the [Social connections](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview) guide for details.  

## Let users authenticate into third-party apps using Clerk as an Identity Provider (IdP)

Clerk can be configured as an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider (IdP) to facilitate Single Sign-On (SSO) with other clients that support the protocols. This guide covers how to configure Clerk as an OAuth 2.0 IdP. If you want to configure it as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) IdP, you can refer to ths dedicated guide.

In this flow, users can authenticate to other applications using their Clerk credentials, enabling user information sharing between your Clerk application and OAuth clients. 

For example, if your user wants to sign in to a third party application, they can select Clerk as the IdP and use their Clerk credentials to sign in. It's similar to signing in to a website and using your Google account to sign in.

### When should you use Clerk as an Identity Provider?

You can use Clerk as an IdP if you want your users to authenticate to a third party site or a tool using their credentials from your Clerk application. **This is not the same as supporting an OAuth provider, such as Google, in your application. If you want your users to be able to sign in to your application with an OAuth provider, see the section above.**

This feature only currently supports the initial authentication flow from your application to the third party site or tool. The OAuth token returned at the end of the flow is not a [Clerk session JWT](/docs/how-clerk-works/overview#session-token) and cannot be used to make authenticated requests from third-party applications to Clerk-protected API endpoints in your app. If you are interested in Clerk adding support for resource access via OAuth tokens, please [add your feedback to this feature request](https://feedback.clerk.com/roadmap/c05eb8be-ae4e-4b7c-ab1e-e0eaf6b4b38a).

### Configure Clerk as an OAuth 2.0 IdP

Clerk is the OAuth 2.0 IdP for your application. The "client" is the third party site or tool that you want your users to authenticate to.

In order to make your Clerk instance operate as a provider, create an OAuth application in the Clerk Dashboard. Then, configure the client to work with your Clerk instance, using the necessary data from your Clerk OAuth application.

### Create a Clerk OAuth application

To create an OAuth application,

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**OAuth Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/oauth-applications) page.
1. Select the **Add OAuth application** button. A modal will open.
1. Complete the following fields:
   - `Name` - helps you identify your application.
   - `Scopes` - the scopes that you would like to leverage.
1. Select **Create**. You'll be redirected to your app's settings page.
1. In the **Redirect URI** field, add the redirect URI that the client provides. This is the URL that Clerk will redirect to after the user has authenticated.

> [!WARNING]
> For security reasons, Clerk does not store your Client Secret and cannot show it to you again, so we recommend you download the secret and store it someplace secure.

### Configure your client

Now that you have set up a Clerk OAuth application, you will need to configure any of the following settings needed in your client.

- **Client ID**: Public identifier of your Clerk OAuth application.
- **Client Secret**: Confidential secret used to authenticate your Clerk OAuth application.
- **Discovery URL**: Used by the client to retrieve the configuration data of the Clerk OAuth application.
- **Authorize URL**: Used by the client to request authorization from your user.
- **Token URL**: Used by the client to exchange an authorization code for an access token and a refresh token.
- **User Info URL**: Used by the client to retrieve additional user data upon authentication.

### Scopes

Scopes define the level of access and specific user data that will be shared with the client application during authentication. The following scopes are currently supported:

| Scope | Access |
| - | - |
| `profile` | Grant access to the user's personal information, such as first and last name, avatar, and username |
| `email` | Grant access to the user's email address |
| `public_metadata` | Grant access to the user's public and unsafe metadata |
| `private_metadata` | Grant access to the user's private metadata |
| `openid` | Enables the OpenID Connect flow |

### Get additional user information

After a user has successfully completed an OAuth 2.0 flow, you can retrieve additional user information from Clerk's [`/oauth/userinfo`](/docs/reference/frontend-api/tag/OAuth2-Identify-Provider#operation/getOAuthUserInfo){{ target: '_blank' }} endpoint. When making the request to this endpoint, you must include the Clerk access token in the `Authorization` header.

The `/oauth/userinfo` endpoint provides the following user properties, depending on the granted scopes:

| Property | Description |
| - | - |
| `user_id` | The ID of the user |
| `sub` | The ID of the user |
| `given_name` | The user's first name |
| `family_name` | The user's last name |
| `name` | The user's full name |
| `picture` | The user's avatar URL |
| `preferred_username` | The user's username |
| `email` | The user's primary email address |
| `email_verified` | Whether the user's primary email address is verified |
| `public_metadata` | The user's public metadata |
| `private_metadata` | The user's private metadata |
| `unsafe_metadata` | The user's unsafe metadata |

### Get token information

For validating access tokens or refresh tokens and retrieving additional token metadata, Clerk provides a standard OAuth 2.0 [Token Introspection Endpoint](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/token-introspection-endpoint/) at [`/oauth/token_info`](/docs/reference/frontend-api/tag/OAuth2-Identify-Provider#operation/getOAuthTokenInfo){{ target: '_blank' }}.

The endpoint returns detailed token information such as if the token is still active, the client ID, and the granted scopes.

> [!WARNING]
> This endpoint is protected. You must provide your Clerk Client ID and Client Secret credentials to authenticate.

### Grant types

Clerk's OAuth 2.0 IdP implementation supports the following authorization flows and grant types:

- [Authorization Code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/)
- [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/)
- [Refresh token](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/refresh-token/)
