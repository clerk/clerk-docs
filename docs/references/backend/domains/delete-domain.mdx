</Properties>

## Example

```tsx
const id = 'test_123'

const response = await clerkClient.users.deleteDomain(id)

console.log(response)
/*
_DeletedObject {
  object: 'domain',
  id: 'test_123',
  slug: null,
  deleted: true

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `DELETE/domains/{domain_id}`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Domains#operation/DeleteDomain){{ target: '_blank' }} for more details.
