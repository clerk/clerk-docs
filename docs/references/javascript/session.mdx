# `Session`

The `Session` object is an abstraction over an HTTP session. It models the period of information exchange between a user and the server.

The `Session` object includes methods for recording session activity and ending the session client-side. For security reasons, sessions can also expire server-side.

As soon as a [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user) signs in, Clerk creates a `Session` for the current [`Client`][client-ref]. Clients can have more than one sessions at any point in time, but only one of those sessions will be **active**.

In certain scenarios, a session might be replaced by another one. This is often the case with [mutli-session applications](/docs/custom-flows/multi-session-applications).

All sessions that are **expired**, **removed**, **replaced**, **ended** or **abandoned** are not considered valid.

> For more details regarding the different session states, see our documentation on [session management](/docs/authentication/configuration/session-options).

## Methods

### `end()`

Marks the session as ended. The session will no longer be active for this `Client` and its status will become **ended**.

```typescript
function end(): Promise<Session>;
```

#### `end()` returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Promise<Session>` | A `Promise` which resolves to the `Session`. |

### `remove()`

Marks the session as removed. The session will no longer be active for this Client and its status will become **removed**.

```typescript
function remove(): Promise<Session>;
```

#### `remove()` returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Promise<Session>` | A `Promise` which resolves to the `Session`. |

### `touch()`

Touches the session, signifying some kind of user activity. Use this method to record any updates to user activity.

```typescript
function touch(): Promise<Session>;
```

#### `touch()` returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Promise<Session>` | A `Promise` which resolves to the `Session`. |

### `getToken()`

Retrieves the user's session token for the given template or the default clerk token. This method uses a cache so a network request will only be made if the token in memory has expired. The TTL for clerk token is one minute.

```typescript
function getToken(options?: GetTokenOptions): Promise<string | null>;
```

#### `GetTokenOptions`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `leewayInSeconds` | `number` | The number of seconds to allow the token to be cached for. |
| `template?` | `string` | The name of the JWT template from the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=jwt-templates) to generate a new token from.<br/>E.g. 'firebase', 'grafbase', or your custom template's name. |
| `throwOnError?` | `boolean` | Whether to throw an error or return an empty string, if an error occurs. |
| `skipCache?` | `boolean` | Whether to skip the cache lookup and force a call to the server instead, even within the TTL. Useful if the token claims are time-sensitive or depend on data that can be updated (e.g. user fields).<br />Defaults to `false`. |

#### `getToken()` returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Promise<string \| null>` | The requested token. |

### `checkAuthorization()`

Checks if the user is authorized for the specified role or permission.

```typescript
function checkAuthorization(param: CheckAuthorizationParams) => boolean;
```

#### `CheckAuthorizationParams`
```typescript
type CheckAuthorizationParams =
  | {
      role: ClerkDefaultRole | CustomRole;
      permission?: never;
    }
  | {
      role?: never;
      permission: ClerkDefaultPermission | CustomPermission;
    };
```

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `role` | `string` | Accepts [role](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#roles) key |
| `permission` | `string` | Accepts [permission](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#permissions) key |
