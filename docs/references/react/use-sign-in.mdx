title: '`useSignIn()`'
description: Access and manage the current user's sign-in state in your React application with Clerk's useSignIn() hook.
---

The `useSignIn()` hook provides access to the [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-in attempt and manage the sign-in flow. You can use this to create a [custom sign-in flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview#sign-in-flow).

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `isLoaded`
  - `boolean`

    A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads.

  ---

  - `setActive()`
  - <code>(params: [SetActiveParams](#set-active-params)) => Promise\<void></code>

  A function that sets the active session.

  ---

  - `signIn`
  - [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in)

  An object that contains the current sign-in attempt status and methods to create a new sign-in attempt.
</Properties>

### `SetActiveParams`

<Properties>
  - `session`
  - <code>[Session](/docs/references/javascript/session) | string | null</code>

  The session resource or session ID (string version) to be set as active. If `null`, the current session is deleted.

  ---

  - `organization`
  - <code>[Organization](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) | string | null</code>

  The organization resource or organization ID/slug (string version) to be set as active in the current session. If `null`, the currently active organization is removed as active.

  ---

  - `beforeEmit?`
  - `(session?: Session | null) => void | Promise<any>`

  Callback run just before the active session and/or organization is set to the passed object. Can be used to hook up for pre-navigation actions.
</Properties>

## How to use the `useSignIn()` hook

### Check the current state of a sign-in

The following example uses the `useSignIn()` hook to access the [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object, which contains the current sign-in attempt status and methods to create a new sign-in attempt. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state.

```tsx {{ filename: 'src/components/SignInPage.tsx' }}
import { useSignIn } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

export default function SignInPage() {
  const { isLoaded, signIn } = useSignIn()

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null
  }

  return <div>The current sign in attempt status is {signIn?.status}.</div>
}
```

### `SignIn` status values

The `status` property of the `SignIn` object can be one of the following values:

<Properties>
  - `complete`
  - `string`

  The user has been signed in and the custom flow can proceed to `setActive()` to create a session.
