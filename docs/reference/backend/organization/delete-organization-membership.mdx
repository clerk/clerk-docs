## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `DELETE/organizations/{organization_id}/memberships/{user_id}`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/organization-memberships/delete/organizations/\{organization_id}/memberships/\{user_id}){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
