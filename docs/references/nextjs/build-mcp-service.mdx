title: Build an MCP service in your Next.js application with Clerk
description: Learn how to build an MCP service using Clerk's OAuth server in your Next.js application.
---

If you're building an app and want to allow large language model (LLM) apps to securely access user data within your app, you’ll need to set up a Model Context Protocol (MCP) service. MCP enables external tools—like LLM-based apps—to request user permission to access specific data from your service.

This guide shows you how to build an MCP service using Clerk's OAuth server in your Next.js application.

<Steps>
  ## Install `@vercel/mcp-adapter`

  The `@vercel/mcp-adapter` library simplifies building a MCP server. It takes care of handling the protocol mechanics and provides an auth wrapper that allows you to plug in your own token validation - in this case, using Clerk's OAuth tokens. Run the following command to install it:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @vercel/mcp-adapter
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @vercel/mcp-adapter
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @vercel/mcp-adapter
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun add @vercel/mcp-adapter
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>
