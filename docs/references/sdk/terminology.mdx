# Terminology

Across the complete surface area that users interact with Clerk’s services (e.g. SDK, docs, dashboard, error messages, support) a shared terminology should be used. Below you can find a list of common terms and their explanations. They’ll also be used in the SDK instructions further below. You should also use them in your SDK.

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| Client | A client represents the current device or software accessing an application such as your web browser, native application, Chrome Extension, or Electron app. |
| Session | A session is a secure representation of the authentication state of the current user. Each client can hold multiple sessions on the same device. This is identical to how Gmail works in a browser. |
| User | A user represents the current user of the session. The object holds all the basic user information e.g. name, email addresses, phone numbers, etc… including their public, private, and unsafe metadata. |
| Organization | An organization represents the current organization of the session. Users can belong to many organizations. One of them will be the current organization of the session. |
| FAPI | Frontend API of Clerk. Example: `https://random-name.clerk.accounts.dev` (Production example: `https://clerk.yourdomain.com`). FAPI is the primary API for Clerk’s UI components. Every Clerk development/production instance has a dedicated FAPI. This is the authentication, session, user & organization management API you or your users will interact with. |
| BAPI | Backend API of Clerk: `https://api.clerk.com`. A restful CRUD API for the server-side. |
| Secret key | Your app’s secret key for use in the backend. Do not expose this on the frontend with a public environment variable. Allows for CRUD operations. |
| Publishable key | Your app’s publishable key for use in the frontend. |
| Instances | When creating an app, you’re provided with two instances: Development and Production. Learn more. |
| Hotloading clerk-js | `@clerk/clerk-js` is the foundational JavaScript library for all frontend JS SDKs, e.g. used in `@clerk/clerk-react`. When you install `@clerk/clerk-react` through npm, you don’t install `@clerk/clerk-js`. Instead, once the React code is executed in the browser, the React SDK adds a `<script>` tag to load clerk-js from a CDN. Clerk internally calls this “hotloading”. |
| UI components | All components displayed in the component reference and available through the Clerk class. |
| Authorization header verification | This refers to the HTTP Authorization request header. Clerk uses this HTTP header instead of the `__client` cookie for secure communication with the FAPI in non-standard web browser environments. For example in React Native apps, Chrome extensions, and hybrid apps like Electron. The `__client` JWT will be stored in a secure storage provided by the platform and injected into the HTTP header of each FAPI request. |
| Handshake | The client handshake is a mechanism that is used to resolve a request’s authentication state from “unknown” to definitively signed in or signed out. Clerk’s session management architecture relies on a short-lived session JWT to validate requests, along with a long-lived session that is used to keep the session JWT fresh by interacting with the FAPI. The long-lived session token is stored in an `HttpOnly` cookie associated with the FAPI domain. If a short-lived session JWT is expired on a request to an application’s backend, the SDK doesn’t know if the session has ended, or if a new short-lived JWT needs to be issued. When an SDK gets into this state, it triggers the handshake. |

## Cookies

Clerk is using cookies in order to keep user sessions alive. The most important cookies are the following:

- Development instances:
    - `__clerk_db_jwt`: This is called `Dev Browser JWT` and helps Clerk sync the session between different domains, because in the dev environment the app is running on `localhost` and Clerk FAPI and Account Portal runs under the `accounts.dev` domain.
    - `__client_uat`: Its naming is coming from `Client Updated At` and it's a hint for Clerk to check if the user session is still valid. It is set by the Clerk.js on the client side.
    - `__session`: A short-lived session JWT to validate request in your application or your API.

- Production instances:
    - `__client`: This is a long-lived HttpOnly cookie that is used to issue short-lived session JWTs. It is set by the Clerk FAPI.
    - `__client_uat`: As described above, but in Production this is set by the Clerk FAPI.
    - `__session`: A short-lived session JWT to validate request in your application or your API.

Clerk is using more non-persistent cookies for internal mechanisms (e.g. `__clerk_handshake`).
