The `auth()` helper returns the [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object of the currently active user, as well as the [`redirectToSignIn()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth#redirect-to-sign-in) method.

- Only available for App Router.
- Only works on the server-side, such as in Server Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions.
- Requires [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware) to be configured.
