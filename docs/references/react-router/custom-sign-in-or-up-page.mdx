title: Build your own sign-in-or-up page for your React Router app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add a custom sign-in-or-up page to your React Router app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component with the [React Router Splat route](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/routing#splats) in order to build a custom page for your Next.js app that allows users to sign in or sign up within a single flow.

If the prebuilt components don’t fully meet your needs or you want greater control over the logic, you can recreate Clerk’s existing flows using the Clerk API.  For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-in-or-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component to allow users to both sign-in or sign-up from a single flow.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-in.tsx' }}
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/react-router'

  export default function SignInPage() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Sign in or up route</h1>
        <SignIn />
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Configure routes

  React Router expects you to define routes in [`app/routes.ts`](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/routing). Add the previously created sign-in-or-up page to your route configuration.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes.ts', mark: [5] }}
  import { type RouteConfig, index, route } from '@react-router/dev/routes'

  export default [
    index('routes/home.tsx'),
    route('sign-in/*', 'routes/sign-in.tsx'),
  ] satisfies RouteConfig
  ```

  ## Configure redirect behavior

  Update your environment variables to point to your custom sign-in-or-up page. Learn more about the available [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables).

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_URL=/
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  ```

  ## Visit your new page

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:5173/sign-in](http://localhost:5173/sign-in).
