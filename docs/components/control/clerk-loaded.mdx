The `<ClerkLoaded>` component guarantees that the Clerk object has loaded (the `status` is `'ready'` or `'degraded'`) and will be available under `window.Clerk`. This allows you to wrap child components to access the `Clerk` object without the need to check it exists.

## Usage

It's not recommended to wrap the entire app in the `<ClerkLoaded>` component; instead, only wrap the components that need access to the `Clerk` object.
