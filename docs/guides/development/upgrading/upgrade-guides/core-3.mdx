description: "Find SDK-specific guides for upgrading to Clerk Core 3."
---

## Overview

Core 3 focuses on consistency and cleanup across Clerk's SDKs while keeping upgrade time short (usually under 30 minutes with the CLI).

- Naming consistency: `__unstable_*` APIs move to `__internal_*`, and experimental methods share the `__experimental_` prefix.
- Package renaming: `@clerk/clerk-react` becomes `@clerk/react`, theming utilities move to `@clerk/ui/themes/experimental`, and types consolidate under `@clerk/shared/types`.
- Appearance updates: `appearance.layout` is now `appearance.options`, `showOptionalFields` defaults to `false`, and color variables apply at full opacity.
- Behavior alignment: redirect props and legacy billing flags are removed in favor of the newer patterns.
- Platform requirements: Node.js 20.9.0+ is required across the updated packages.

Use `npx @clerk/upgrade` to scan your project and speed up the migration.

  <AccordionPanel>
    All `__unstable_*` methods have been renamed to `__internal_*`. These are internal APIs not intended for public use.

    ### @clerk/clerk-js

    - `__unstable__environment` → `__internal_environment`
    - `__unstable__updateProps` → `__internal_updateProps`
    - `__unstable__setEnvironment` → `__internal_setEnvironment`
    - `__unstable__onBeforeRequest` → `__internal_onBeforeRequest`
    - `__unstable__onAfterResponse` → `__internal_onAfterResponse`
    - `__unstable__onBeforeSetActive` → `__internal_onBeforeSetActive`
    - `__unstable__onAfterSetActive` → `__internal_onAfterSetActive`

    ### @clerk/nextjs

    - `__unstable_invokeMiddlewareOnAuthStateChange` → `__internal_invokeMiddlewareOnAuthStateChange`

    ### @clerk/chrome-extension

    - `__unstable__createClerkClient` → `createClerkClient` (exported from `@clerk/chrome-extension/background`)
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `@clerk/clerk-react` package has been renamed to `@clerk/react`.

    Update your imports:

    ```diff
    - import { ClerkProvider, useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-react';
    + import { ClerkProvider, useUser } from '@clerk/react';
    ```

    And update your package.json:

    ```diff
    - "@clerk/clerk-react": "^5.0.0",
    + "@clerk/react": "^7.0.0",
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `appearance.layout` property has been renamed to `appearance.options`. Update all instances in your codebase:

    ```diff
    <ClerkProvider
      appearance={{
    -   layout: {
    +   options: {
          socialButtonsPlacement: 'bottom',
          socialButtonsVariant: 'iconButton',
        }
      }}
    >
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `colorRing` and `colorModalBackdrop` CSS variables now render at full opacity when modified via the appearance prop or CSS variables. Previously, provided colors were rendered at 15% opacity.

    If you were relying on the previous behavior, you may need to adjust your color values to include the desired opacity:

    ```diff
    appearance={{
      variables: {
    -   colorRing: '#6366f1',
    +   colorRing: 'rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.15)',
      }
    }}
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The return values of `useCheckout` hook and `Clerk.checkout()` have been updated.

    ### React Hook

    ```diff
    - const { id, plan, status, start, confirm, paymentSource } = useCheckout({ planId: "xxx", planPeriod: "annual" });
    + const { checkout, errors, fetchStatus } = useCheckout({ planId: "xxx", planPeriod: "annual" });
    + // Access properties via checkout object
    + checkout.plan
    + checkout.status
    + checkout.start()
    + checkout.confirm()
    ```

    ### Vanilla JS

    ```diff
    - const { getState, subscribe, confirm, start, clear, finalize } = Clerk.checkout({ planId: "xxx", planPeriod: "annual" });
    - getState().isStarting
    - getState().checkout
    + const { checkout, errors, fetchStatus } = Clerk.checkout({ planId: "xxx", planPeriod: "annual" });
    + checkout.plan
    + checkout.status
    + checkout.start()
    + checkout.confirm()
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    All experimental methods now use the `__experimental_` prefix consistently. Update any references:

    ```diff
    - experimental__someMethod
    + __experimental_someMethod

    - experimental_someMethod
    + __experimental_someMethod
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `createTheme` theme utility has been moved to a new export path. Update your imports:

    ```diff
    - import { __experimental_createTheme } from '@clerk/ui';
    + import { createTheme } from '@clerk/ui/themes/experimental';
    ```

    Note: The `__experimental_` prefix has been removed from the method since they're now in the `/themes/experimental` subpath.
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

## Deprecation Removals

### `afterSwitchOrganizationUrl` removed from `OrganizationSwitcher`

The `afterSwitchOrganizationUrl` prop has been removed from `OrganizationSwitcher`. Use `afterSelectOrganizationUrl` instead:

```diff
<OrganizationSwitcher
- afterSwitchOrganizationUrl="/org-dashboard"
+ afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/org-dashboard"
/>
```

### `Client.activeSessions` removed

The `activeSessions` property has been removed from the `Client` object. Use `sessions` instead:

```diff
- const sessions = client.activeSessions;
+ const sessions = client.sessions;
```

### `hideSlug` prop removed

The `hideSlug` prop has been removed. Organization slugs are now managed through the Clerk Dashboard under Organization Settings.

```diff
<OrganizationProfile
- hideSlug={true}
/>
```

To hide organization slugs, update your settings in the Clerk Dashboard → Organization Settings → Slug.

### `saml` strategy renamed to `enterprise_sso`

The `saml` authentication strategy has been renamed to `enterprise_sso`. Update any references in your code:

```diff
- strategy: 'saml'
+ strategy: 'enterprise_sso'
```

### `samlAccount` renamed to `enterpriseAccount`

The `samlAccount` property has been renamed to `enterpriseAccount`. Update your code:

```diff
- user.samlAccounts
+ user.enterpriseAccounts

- verification.samlAccount
+ verification.enterpriseAccount
```

### `setActive({ beforeEmit })` changed to `setActive({ navigate })`

The `beforeEmit` callback in `setActive()` has been replaced with `navigate`. The callback signature has also changed:

```diff
await setActive({
  session: sessionId,
- beforeEmit: () => {
-   // Called before session is set
- }
+ navigate: ({ session }) => {
+   // Called with the session object
+   return '/dashboard';
+ }
});
```

The `navigate` callback receives an object with the `session` property and should return the URL to navigate to.

### `UserButton` sign-out redirect props removed

The `UserButton` component no longer accepts sign-out redirect override props. Configure sign-out redirects using one of these methods:

**Global configuration:**

```jsx
<ClerkProvider afterSignOutUrl="/signed-out">
```

**Per-button with SignOutButton:**

```jsx
<SignOutButton redirectUrl='/goodbye'>Sign Out</SignOutButton>
```

**Programmatic:**

```js
clerk.signOut({ redirectUrl: '/signed-out' });
```

### `UserSettings.saml` renamed to `enterpriseSSO`

The `saml` property on `UserSettings` has been renamed to `enterpriseSSO`:

```diff
- userSettings.saml
+ userSettings.enterpriseSSO
```

### Legacy redirect props removed

The legacy redirect props `afterSignInUrl`, `afterSignUpUrl`, and `redirectUrl` have been removed from components. Use the newer redirect options:

```diff
<SignIn
- afterSignInUrl="/dashboard"
- afterSignUpUrl="/onboarding"
+ fallbackRedirectUrl="/dashboard"
+ signUpFallbackRedirectUrl="/onboarding"
/>
```

For forced redirects that ignore the `redirect_url` query parameter:

```diff
<SignIn
+ forceRedirectUrl="/dashboard"
+ signUpForceRedirectUrl="/onboarding"
/>
```

### Unstable billing props removed

The following unstable properties have been removed. If you were relying on these, please reach out to support.

- `__unstable_manageBillingUrl`
- `__unstable_manageBillingLabel`
- `__unstable_manageBillingMembersLimit`

## Deprecations

### `@clerk/types` deprecated in favor of `@clerk/shared/types`

The `@clerk/types` package is deprecated. All type definitions have been consolidated into `@clerk/shared/types`.

Update your imports:

```diff
- import type { ClerkResource, UserResource } from '@clerk/types';
+ import type { ClerkResource, UserResource } from '@clerk/shared/types';
```

The `@clerk/types` package will continue to re-export types from `@clerk/shared/types` for backward compatibility, but new types will only be added to `@clerk/shared/types`.

## Version

### Upgrade Node.js to v20.9.0 or higher

All Clerk packages now require Node.js 20.9.0 or later. Update your Node.js version and ensure your `package.json` engines field reflects this requirement.

```diff
{
  "engines": {
-   "node": ">=18.0.0"
+   "node": ">=20.9.0"
  }
}
```

## Behavior Change

### `showOptionalFields` now defaults to `false`

The default value of `appearance.layout.showOptionalFields` (now `appearance.options.showOptionalFields`) has changed from `true` to `false`. Optional fields are now hidden by default during sign up.

To restore the previous behavior, explicitly set the option:

```jsx
<ClerkProvider
  appearance={{
    options: {
      showOptionalFields: true,
    }
  }}
>
```
