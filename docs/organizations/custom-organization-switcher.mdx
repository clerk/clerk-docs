# Create a custom organization switcher

If you need more control than what Clerk's prebuilt [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/components/organization/organization-switcher) component provides, you can build your own organization switcher using the [`useOrganizationList()`](/docs/references/react/use-organization-list) hook.

The following example shows how you can build an organization switcher in a Next.js application. It requires the installation of the [`react-select`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-select) package and the [`@emotion/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emotion/react) package. For your convenience, you can copy and paste the following into your terminal:

<CodeBlockTabs type="terminal" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
```sh
npm i react-select @emotion/react
```

```sh
yarn add react-select @emotion/react
```

```sh
pnpm add react-select @emotion/react
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

Then, create a new file called `OrganizationSwitcher.js` and paste the following code into it. You can place this file anywhere in your project, but in this example, it is placed in a folder called `components`.

```jsx filename="components/OrganizationSwitcher.js"
import { useOrganization, useOrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs';
import Select from 'react-select';

function createOrganizationOptions(organizationList) {
  return organizationList.map(({ organization }) => ({
    value: organization.id,
    label: organization.name
  }));
}

export default function CustomOrganizationSwitcher() {
  const { setActive, organizationList, isLoaded } = useOrganizationList();
  const { organization } = useOrganization();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    return null;
  }

  const handleOrgChange = e => {
    setActive({ organization: e.value });
  };

  if (!organization) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <Select
      options={createOrganizationOptions(organizationList)}
      onChange={handleOrgChange}
      value={{ value: organization.id, label: organization.name }}
    />
  );
}
```
