{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/api/endpoints/UserApi.ts#L189 */}

Retrieves the total number of users.

```ts
function getCount(params: UserCountParams): Promise<number>
```

## `UserCountParams`

The total count of users can be filtered down by adding one or more of these parameters.

<Properties>
  - `emailAddress?`
  - `string[]`

  Counts users with emails that match the given query, via case-insensitive partial match. For example, `hello` will match a user with the email `hello@example.com`.

  ---

  - `phoneNumber?`
  - `string[]`

  Counts users with phone numbers that match the given query, via case-insensitive partial match. For example, `555` will match a user with the phone number `+1555xxxxxxx`.

  ---

  - `externalId?`
  - `string[]`

  Counts users with the specified external IDs.

  ---

  - `username?`
  - `string[]`

  Counts users with the specified usernames.

  ---

  - `web3wallet?`
  - `string[]`

  Counts users with the specified Web3 wallet addresses.

  ---

  - `userId?`
  - `string`

  Counts users with the user IDs specified.

  ---

  - `query?`
  - `string`

  Counts users that match the given query. For possible matches, Clerk checks the email addresses, phone numbers, usernames, Web3 wallet addresses, user IDs, first and last names. The query value doesn't need to match the exact value you are looking for, it is capable of partial matches as well.
</Properties>

## Examples

### Basic

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.users.getCount()

console.log(response)
/*
369
*/
```

### Filter by query

The following example retrieves the total number of users matching the query `test`.

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.users.getCount({ query: 'test' })
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/users/count`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/GetUsersCount){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
