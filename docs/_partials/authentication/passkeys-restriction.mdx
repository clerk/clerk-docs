Passkeys are tied to the domain they are created on and **cannot be used across different domains**. For example:

- Passkeys created on `localhost` will only work on `localhost`.
- Passkeys created on your Account Portal (e.g., `your-app.accounts.dev`) will only work on that domain.

To work around this in development, you can either:

- Use Clerk's [Components](/docs/components/overview), [Elements](/docs/customization/elements/overview), or [custom flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview), instead of using Account Portal.
- Create the passkey directly through Account Portal instead of your local application.

**This issue does not affect production environments**, as your Account Portal will be hosted on a subdomain of your main domain (e.g., `accounts.your-domain.com`), enabling passkeys to work seamlessly across your application.
