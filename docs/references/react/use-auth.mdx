title: '`useAuth()`'
description: Clerk's useAuth() hook is a convenient way to access the current auth state.
---

The `useAuth()` hook provides information about the current auth state, as well as helper methods to manage the current active session.

## `useAuth()` returns

<Properties>
  - `isSignedIn`
  - `boolean`

  A boolean that returns true if the user is signed in.

  ---

  - `isLoaded`
  - `boolean`

  A boolean that until Clerk loads and initializes, will be set to `false`. Once Clerk loads, `isLoaded` will be set to `true`.

  ---

  - `userId`
  - `string`

  The current user's ID.

  ---

  - `sessionId`
  - `string`

  The current user's session ID.

  ---

  - `orgId`
  - `string`

  The current user's active organization ID.

  ---

  - `orgRole`
  - `string`

  The current user's active organization role.

  ---

  - `orgSlug`
  - `string`

  The current user's organization slug.

  ---

  - `signOut()`
  - `(options?: SignOutOptions) => Promise<void>`

  A function that signs the user out. See the [reference documentation](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk#sign-out) for more information.

  ---

  - `getToken()`
  - `(options?: GetTokenOptions) => Promise<string | null>`

  A function that returns a promise that resolves to the current user's session token. Can also be used to retrieve a custom JWT template. See the [reference documentation](/docs/references/javascript/session#get-token) for more information.

  ---

  - `has()`
  - `(isAuthorizedParams: CheckAuthorizationParamsWithCustomPermissions) => boolean`

  A function that returns a boolean based on the permission or role provided as parameter. Can be used for authorization. See the [reference documentation](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#has){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.

## How to use the `useAuth()` hook

> [!NOTE]
> For Next.js apps, it's recommended to use the [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) helper instead of the `useAuth()` hook. Since `auth()` is used in server components, you'll need to pass the auth data to Client Components as needed. If you prefer to use the `useAuth()` hook, pass the `dynamic` prop to the `<ClerkProvider>` component, but note that this switches the app to dynamic rendering. Learn more [here](/docs/references/nextjs/rendering-modes).

The following example demonstrates how to use the `useAuth()` hook to access the current auth state, like whether the user is signed in or not. It also demonstrates a basic example of how you could use the `getToken()` method to retrieve a session token for fetching data from an external resource.

```tsx {{ filename: 'external-data-page.tsx' }}
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

export default function ExternalDataPage() {
  const { getToken, isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useAuth()

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state however you like
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  if (!isSignedIn) {
    // Handle signed out state however you like
    return <div>Sign in to view this page</div>
  }

  const fetchDataFromExternalResource = async () => {
    const token = await getToken()
    // Add logic to fetch your data
    return data
  }

  return <div>...</div>
}
```
