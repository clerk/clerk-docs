---

The `<ClerkProvider>` component wraps your React application to provide active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components.

## Usage

The `<ClerkProvider>` component must be added to your React entrypoint.

<Tabs type="framework" items={["Next.js", "React"]}>
  <Tab>
    By default, the `<ClerkProvider>` component has a server component wrapper in order to access header information. This means anything wrapped by the provider will be opted into dynamic rendering at request time.

    If you would prefer not to be opted into dynamic rendering, such as for static-optimized or ISR pages, you can either use `<ClerkProvider>` in a client component, or ensure the content is not wrapped by `<ClerkProvider>`. Instead of wrapping your application root with the provider, you can place it further down the tree to wrap route groups that require authentication.

    For example, if your project includes a set of landing/marketing pages and a dashboard that requires sign-in, you can create separate route groups for marketing and dashboard pages. By adding `<ClerkProvider>` to the `(dashboard)/layout.jsx` file, only the dashboard routes will opt into dynamic rendering, while the marketing routes remain statically optimized.

    <CodeBlockTabs type="router" options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx' }}
      import React from 'react'
      import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
        return (
          <html lang="en">
            <head>
              <title>Next.js 13 with Clerk</title>
            </head>
            <ClerkProvider>
              <body>{children}</body>
            </ClerkProvider>
          </html>
        )
      }
      ```

      ```tsx {{ filename: '_app.tsx' }}
      import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
      import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

      function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
        return (
          <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
          </ClerkProvider>
        )
      }

      export default MyApp
      ```
    </CodeBlockTabs>
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```tsx {{ filename: 'index.tsx' }}
    import React from 'react'
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
    import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react'
    import App from './App'

    const publishableKey = process.env.REACT_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

    ReactDOM.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <ClerkProvider publishableKey={publishableKey}>
          <App />
        </ClerkProvider>
      </React.StrictMode>,
      document.getElementById('root'),
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

> Other meta-frameworks, like [Remix](/docs/quickstarts/remix#configure-clerk-app), have wrappers around `<ClerkProvider>` to make their integrations tighter.
