# Organizations

Organizations are a way of grouping your app’s users. Organizations are shared accounts, useful for project and team leaders—think of GitHub Teams or the different departments of a company. Members of different organizations can usually collaborate across shared resources but might have different levels of access and permissions with different [roles](https://clerk.com/docs/organizations/overview#roles).

There is no limit to the number of organizations a user can be a member of. However, a user can only create up to 100 organizations in a given application instance. All members of an organization can view information about other members in the same organization.

Clerk provides [prebuilt components](https://clerk.com/docs/components/overview), [React hooks](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization), and [APIs](https://clerk.com/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) to help you integrate organizations into your application. Using the [Organizations Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organizations), you can provide additional [private and public metadata for the organization](https://clerk.com/docs/organizations/metadata) and set custom attributes.

## Roles

Roles determine a user's level of access and permissions within an organization. Clerk comes with two default roles, `admin` and `basic_member`, and lets you create your own custom roles. Learn more in [Roles and Permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions).
