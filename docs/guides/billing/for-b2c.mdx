Clerk Billing for B2C SaaS allows you to create Plans and manage Subscriptions **for individual users** in your application. If you'd like to charge companies or organizations, see [Billing for B2B SaaS](/docs/guides/billing/for-b2b). You can also combine both B2C and B2B Billing in the same application.

## Create a Plan

Subscription Plans are what your users subscribe to. There is no limit to the number of Plans you can create.

To create a Plan, navigate to the [**Plans**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/billing/plans) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Here, you can create, edit, and delete Plans. To setup B2C Billing, select the **Plans for Users** tab and select **Add Plan**. When creating a Plan, you can also create Features for the Plan; see the next section for more information.

> Plans appear in some Clerk components depending on what kind of Plan it is. All Plans can appear in the `<PricingTable />` component. If it's a user Plan, it can appear in the `<UserProfile />` component. When creating or editing a Plan, if you'd like to hide it from appearing in Clerk components, you can toggle the **Publicly available** option off.

## Add Features to a Plan

[Features](/docs/guides/secure/features) make it easy to give entitlements to your Plans. You can add any number of Features to a Plan.

You can add a Feature to a Plan when you are creating a Plan. To add it after a Plan is created:

1. Navigate to the [**Plans**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/billing/plans) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
1. Select the Plan you'd like to add a Feature to.
1. In the **Features** section, select **Add Feature**.

If it's a user Plan, it can appear in the `<UserProfile />` component. When adding a Feature to a Plan, it will also automatically appear in the corresponding Plan. When creating or editing a Feature, if you'd like to hide it from appearing in Clerk components, you can toggle the **Publicly available** option off.

## Create a pricing page

You can create a pricing page by using the [`<PricingTable />`](/docs/reference/components/billing/pricing-table) component. This component displays a table of Plans and Features that users can subscribe to. **It's recommended to create a dedicated page**, as shown in the following example.

<Include src="_partials/billing/create-a-pricing-table" />

## Control access with Features and Plans

You can use Clerk's Features and Plans to gate access to the content. There are a few ways to do this, but the recommended approach is to either use the [`has()`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#has) method or the [`<Protect>`](/docs/reference/components/control/protect) component.

The `has()` method is available for any JavaScript framework, while `<Protect>` is only available for React-based frameworks.

### Example: Using `has()`

Use the `has()` method to test if the user has access to a **Plan**:

```jsx
const hasPremiumAccess = has({ plan: 'gold' })
```

Or a **Feature**:

```jsx
const hasPremiumAccess = has({ feature: 'widgets' })
```

The [`has()`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#has) method is a server-side helper that checks if the Organization has been granted a specific type of access control (Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan) and returns a boolean value. `has()` is available on the [`auth` object](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object), which you will access differently [depending on the framework you are using](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#how-to-access-the-auth-object).

### Example: Using `<Protect>`

The [`<Protect>`](/docs/reference/components/control/protect) component protects content or even entire routes by checking if the user has been granted a specific type of access control (Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan). You can pass a `fallback` prop to `<Protect>` that will be rendered if the user does not have the access control.
