# Organization metadata

Metadata allows for custom data to be saved on the `Organization` and `Organization Membership` objects. There are two types of metadata: **public** and **private**. Choosing which metadata field you should use for setting custom attributes on your organizations becomes a matter of access and visibility.

| Metadata | Frontend API | Backend API |
| --- | --- | --- |
| private | - | Read and write |
| public | Read | Read and write |

<Callout type="warning">
    Metadata is limited to **8kb** maximum.
</Callout>

Both public and private metadata are set from the [Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api), but public metadata can be accessed from the Frontend API and [Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api). These types of metadata can be used to access non-sensitive information about an organization, such as their profile picture or their name. They can be used to build UIs where an organization might not be signed in, but you still want to show some of their profile info.

The `publicMetadata` property should be used if you need to set some metadata from your backend and have them displayed as read-only on the frontend.

The `privateMetadata` property should be used if custom attributes contain sensitive information that should not be displayed on the frontend.
