sdk: js-backend
---

Deletes a satellite domain for the instance. It is currently not possible to delete the instance's primary domain. Returns a [`DeletedObjectResource`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/deleted-object-resource).

```ts
function deleteDomain(id: string): Promise<DeletedObjectResource>
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `id`
  - `string`

  The ID of the domain that will be deleted. Must be a satellite domain.
</Properties>

## Example

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

```tsx
const id = 'test_123'

const response = await clerkClient.users.deleteDomain(id)
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `DELETE/domains/{domain_id}`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/domains/delete/domains/\{domain_id}){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
