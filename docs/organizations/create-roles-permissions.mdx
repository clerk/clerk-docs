In the Clerk Dashboard, you can create roles, assign permissions to them, and change users' roles.

## Create a new role for your organization

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to [**Roles**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings/roles)
1. Select **Create new role**.
1. Give the role a name, a key to reference it by in the format `org:<role>`, and a description.
1. Select **Create role**.

## Create a new permission for your organization

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to [**Permissions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings/permissions).

1. Select **Create new permission**.

1. Give the permission a name, a key to reference it by in the format `org:<feature>:<permission>`, and a description.
   > [!NOTE]
   > Common permission values could be:
   >
   > - `create` — to allow creating resources
   > - `read` — to allow reading/viewing resources
   > - `update/manage` — to allow updating/editing resources
   > - `delete` — to allow deleting resources
   >
   > For example, you could create a new permission called **Create invoices** (`org:invoices:create`) which allows only users with this permission to edit invoices. Then, you could assign this permission to a role, or multiple roles, such as **Billing** (`org:billing`) or **Sales** (`org:sales`).

1. Select **Create permission**.

## Change a user's role in an organization

1. In the top in the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Organizations**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations) and select an organization.
1. Select the **Members** tab.
1. In the list of members, find the one whose role you want to change.
1. Select another role from their role dropdown.

## Delete a role in your organization

You cannot delete a role that is still assigned to members of an organization. Change the members to a different role before completing the following steps.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to [**Roles**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings/roles).
1. Select the "..." menu next to the role.
