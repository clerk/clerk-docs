description: Clerk currently offers four pre-built themes for you to customize the overall appearance of your Clerk app.
---

Clerk currently offers four pre-built themes that can be exported from `@clerk/themes`:

- [The default theme](#default-theme)
- [The "Dark" Theme](#dark-theme)
- [The "Shades of Purple" Theme](#shades-of-purple-theme)
- [The "Neobrutalism" Theme](#neobrutalism-theme)

## Usage

To get started, install the `@clerk/themes` package.

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/themes
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add @clerk/themes
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @clerk/themes
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

To use a theme, import it from `@clerk/themes` and pass it to the `appearance` prop of a Clerk component. You can pass it to the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component to apply it to all Clerk components in your app or you can pass it to a single Clerk component. For guided examples and to learn further about how to use themes, see the [Appearance prop](/docs/components/customization/overview#using-a-pre-built-theme) documentiation.
