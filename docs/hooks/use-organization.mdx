## Parameters

`useOrganization()` accepts a single object with the following optional properties:

<Properties>

</Properties>

> [!WARNING]
> By default, the `memberships`, `invitations`, `membershipRequests`, and `domains` attributes aren't populated. To fetch and paginate the data, you must pass `true` or an object with the desired properties.

### Shared properties

Optional properties that are shared across the `invitations`, `membershipRequests`, `memberships`, and `domains` properties.

<Include src="_partials/hooks/shared-properties" />

> [!NOTE]
> These attributes are updating automatically and will re-render their respective components whenever you set a different organization using the [`setActive({ organization })`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk#set-active) method or update any of the memberships or invitations. No need for you to manage updating anything manually.

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `isLoaded`
  - `boolean`

  A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads.

## How to use the `useOrganization()` hook

### Expand and paginate attributes

To keep network usage to a minimum, developers are required to opt-in by specifying which resource they need to fetch and paginate through. By default, the `memberships`, `invitations`, `membershipRequests`, and `domains` attributes are not populated. You must pass `true` or an object with the desired [properties](#shared-properties) to fetch and paginate the data.

```jsx
// invitations.data will never be populated.
const { invitations } = useOrganization()

// Use default values to fetch invitations, such as initialPage = 1 and pageSize = 10
const { invitations } = useOrganization({
  invitations: true,
})

// Pass your own values to fetch invitations
const { invitations } = useOrganization({
  invitations: {
    pageSize: 20,
    initialPage: 2, // skips the first page
  },
})

// Aggregate pages in order to render an infinite list
const { invitations } = useOrganization({
  invitations: {
    infinite: true,
  },
})
```

### Infinite pagination

The following example demonstrates how to use the `infinite` property to fetch and append new data to the existing list. The `memberships` attribute will be populated with the first page of the organization's memberships. When the "Load more" button is clicked, the `fetchNext` helper function will be called to append the next page of memberships to the list.

<Tabs items={['React', 'Next.js']}>
  <Tab>
    ```jsx
    import { useOrganization } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

    export default function MemberList() {
      const { memberships } = useOrganization({
        memberships: {
          infinite: true, // Append new data to the existing list
          keepPreviousData: true, // Persist the cached data until the new data has been fetched
        },
      })

      if (!memberships) {
        // Handle loading state
        return null
      }

      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Organization members</h2>
          <ul>
            {memberships.data?.map((membership) => (
              <li key={membership.id}>
                {membership.publicUserData.firstName} {membership.publicUserData.lastName} &lt;
                {membership.publicUserData.identifier}&gt; :: {membership.role}
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>

          <button
            disabled={!memberships.hasNextPage} // Disable the button if there are no more available pages to be fetched
            onClick={memberships.fetchNext}
          >
            Load more
          </button>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/users/page.tsx' }}
    'use client'

    import { useOrganization } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    export default function MemberListPage() {
      const { memberships } = useOrganization({
        memberships: {
          infinite: true, // Append new data to the existing list
          keepPreviousData: true, // Persist the cached data until the new data has been fetched
        },
      })

      if (!memberships) {
        // Handle loading state
        return null
      }

      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Organization members</h2>
          <ul>
            {memberships.data?.map((membership) => (
              <li key={membership.id}>
                {membership.publicUserData.firstName} {membership.publicUserData.lastName} &lt;
                {membership.publicUserData.identifier}&gt; :: {membership.role}
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>

          <button
            disabled={!memberships.hasNextPage} // Disable the button if there are no more available pages to be fetched
            onClick={memberships.fetchNext}
          >
            Load more
          </button>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Simple pagination

The following example demonstrates how to use the `fetchPrevious` and `fetchNext` helper functions to paginate through the data. The `memberships` attribute will be populated with the first page of the organization's memberships. When the "Previous page" or "Next page" button is clicked, the `fetchPrevious` or `fetchNext` helper function will be called to fetch the previous or next page of memberships.

Notice the difference between this example's pagination and the infinite pagination example above.

<Tabs items={['React', 'Next.js']}>
  <Tab>
    ```jsx
    import { useOrganization } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

    export default function MemberList() {
      const { memberships } = useOrganization({
        memberships: {
          keepPreviousData: true, // Persist the cached data until the new data has been fetched
        },
      })

      if (!memberships) {
        // Handle loading state
        return null
      }

      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Organization members</h2>
          <ul>
            {memberships.data?.map((membership) => (
              <li key={membership.id}>
                {membership.publicUserData.firstName} {membership.publicUserData.lastName} &lt;
                {membership.publicUserData.identifier}&gt; :: {membership.role}
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>

          <button disabled={!memberships.hasPreviousPage} onClick={memberships.fetchPrevious}>
            Previous page

          <button disabled={!memberships.hasNextPage} onClick={memberships.fetchNext}>
            Next page
          </button>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

        memberships: {
          keepPreviousData: true, // Persist the cached data until the new data has been fetched
        },
      })

      if (!memberships) {

            {memberships.data?.map((membership) => (
              <li key={membership.id}>
                {membership.publicUserData.firstName} {membership.publicUserData.lastName} &lt;
                {membership.publicUserData.identifier}&gt; :: {membership.role}
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>

          <button disabled={!memberships.hasPreviousPage} onClick={memberships.fetchPrevious}>
            Previous page
          </button>

          <button disabled={!memberships.hasNextPage} onClick={memberships.fetchNext}>
            Next page
          </button>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
