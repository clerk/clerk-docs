The SAML connection is ready to enable! Once enabled, all users with email addresses ending in the domain will be redirected to Okta at sign-up and sign-in.

> [!WARNING]
> If there are existing users with email domains that match the SAML connection, and there is an error in the SAML configuration in Clerk or Okta, those users will be **unable to sign in** when the connection is enabled. If this is a concern, we recommend coordinating with your counterpart to test the connection at an off-peak time.

To make the connection available for your users to authenticate with:

1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where you should still have the connection's configuration page open. If not, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page and select the connection.
1. At the top of the page, toggle on **Enable connection** and select **Save**.
