In the Clerk Dashboard, all workspaces are organizations:

- **Personal workspace**: When you sign up for Clerk, an organization labeled "Personal workspace" is automatically created for you. This allows you to invite team members and collaborate immediately.
- **Additional workspaces**: You can create additional workspaces to manage different projects, teams, or clients. The workspace that a user is currently viewing is called the active workspace (learn more for the [active organization](/docs/organizations/overview#active-organization)).

This guide will walk you through how to use the Clerk Dashboard to create additional workspaces, invite collaborators, and transfer your apps between workspaces.

## Create additional workspaces

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select **Create workspace**. A modal will open.
1. Complete the form. Workspace slugs are unique across all instances, so common naming conventions might already be in use by another instance.
1. Select **Create workspace**. The newly created workspace will be set the active workspace.

## Invite collaborators to your workspace

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select **Manage**. You will be redirected to the Team settings page of the active workspace.
1. Select **Invite user**.
1. In the **Invite user** form, enter the email of the user you want to invite and select the role to assign.
1. Select **Invite**.

## Transfer ownership of an application

Transferring an application between two workspaces, does not cause disruptions. Your API keys, settings, domains, and other configurations remain unchanged, and your app will continue to function as expected. Only the ownership is updated, so no further action is needed to maintain continuity for existing users.

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), open the workspace dropdown and select the workspace that contains the application you want to transfer.
1. Locate and select the application to transfer.
1. At the top of the Clerk Dashboard, select **Configure**.
1. In the navigation sidenav, under the **Application** heading, select [**Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=settings).
1. Select **Transfer ownership**. A modal will open.
1. Complete the form and select **Transfer ownership**. The page will redirect to the **Applications** page and show the transferred application.

### Transfer to a workspace without billing information

**An application with an existing paid subscription can only be transferred to a workspace with active billing information**. You can set up billing information on the receiving workspace without being charged.

To set up a payment method without being charged:

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select the workspace that you want to transfer the application to.
1. Select the workspace dropdown again, and select **Manage**.
1. In the top menu bar, select **Billing**, then select **Upgrade to unlimited members**.
1. Add your billing information. **You will not be charged immediately**. Doing this just ensures billing information is added to the workspace.
1. Once that billing information is added, you will be able to transfer your Clerk app to the receiving workspace.
