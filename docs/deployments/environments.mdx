# Environments / Instances

When creating a new application within Clerk, you are typically provided with two instances: `Development` and `Production`.  These instances vary slightly and should be used appropriately.

## Development Instance
A `Development` instance is Clerk's default instance type and has characteristics that allow it to be more useful for local development. To facilitate development and local authentication, `Development` instances have a more relaxed security posture and are not suitable for production workloads.

Some notable examples of `Development`-only characteristics are: 
- A "Development" banner is shown prominently to make clear you're managing or configuring non-production data
- Email and SMS templates are prefixed with the environment type to prevent against using `Development` instances for production purposes
- Some social connections use shared credentials by default 
- Certain functionality, like Bot Protection, is only available in Production mode
> **Note:** All paid functionality is available in a `Development` instance. However, when you deploy your application to `Production` you will be asked to upgrade to a `Pro` account. See [our pricing page](/pricing) for full details.
## Production Instance
A `Production` instance is the more robust Clerk's instance types. `Production` instances are meant to support high volumes of traffic and by default have a more strict security posture.

Some notable differences between `Production` and `Development` instances are: 
- You must associate a production domain within the Dashboard
- You are required to provision your own SSO credentials 
To take advantage, you must activate your `Production` environment. We've created a guide for [Deploying to Production](/docs/deployments/overview#deploying-to-production) to help you avoid any common pitfalls.
