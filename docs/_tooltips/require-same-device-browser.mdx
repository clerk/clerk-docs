The [**Require the same device and browser** setting in the Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/user-and-authentication): email links are required to be verified from the same device and browser on which the sign-up or sign-in was initiated. For example, if enabled and a user tries to sign in from their desktop browser, and then they open the email link on their mobile phone to verify their email address, the user's sign-in on the desktop browser **gets an error** because the link was verified on a different device and browser.
