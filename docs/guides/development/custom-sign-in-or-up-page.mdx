title: Build your own sign-in-or-up page for your Next.js app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add a custom sign-in-or-up page to your Next.js app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
sdk: nextjs
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in) component to build a custom page that **allows users to sign in or sign up within a single flow**.

To set up separate sign-in and sign-up pages, follow this guide, and then follow the [custom sign-up page guide](/docs/nextjs/guides/development/custom-sign-up-page).

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-in-or-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in) component on a dedicated page using the [Next.js optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments).

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx' }}
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignIn />
  }
  ```

  ## Make the sign-in-or-up route public

  By default, `clerkMiddleware()` makes all routes public. **This step is specifically for applications that have configured `clerkMiddleware()` to make [all routes protected](/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware#protect-all-routes).** If you have not configured `clerkMiddleware()` to protect all routes, you can skip this step.

  <Include src="_partials/nextjs/nextjs-15-callout" />

  To make the sign-in route public:

  - Navigate to your `proxy.ts` file.
  - Create a new [route matcher](/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware#create-route-matcher) that matches the sign-in route, or you can add it to your existing route matcher that is making routes public.
  - Create a check to see if the user's current route is a public route. If it is not a public route, use [`auth.protect()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth#auth-protect) to protect the route.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'proxy.ts' }}
  import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/sign-in(.*)'])

  export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
    if (!isPublicRoute(req)) {
      await auth.protect()
    }
  })

  export const config = {
    matcher: [
      // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
      '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
      // Always run for API routes
      '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
    ],
  }
  ```

  ## Update your environment variables

  - Set the `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` environment variable to tell Clerk where the `<SignIn />` component is being hosted.
  - Set `CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users visit the `/sign-in` route directly.
  - Set `CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users select the 'Don't have an account? Sign up' link at the bottom of the component.

  Learn more about these environment variables and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/development/customize-redirect-urls).

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
  ```

  ## Visit your new page

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-in](http://localhost:3000/sign-in).
