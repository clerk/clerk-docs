![The \<Waitlist /> component renders a form that allows users to join for early access to your app.](/docs/images/ui-components/waitlist.png){{ style: { maxWidth: '460px' } }}

In **Waitlist** mode, users can register their interest in your app by joining a waitlist. This mode is ideal for apps in early development stages or those wanting to generate interest before launch. [Learn more about additional features available in **Waitlist** mode](/docs/guides/secure/restricting-access#waitlist).

The `<Waitlist />` component renders a form that allows users to join for early access to your app.

<If sdk="nextjs">
  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using Next.js, the`<Waitlist />` component is available in `@clerk/nextjs@6.2.0` and above.
</If>

## Enable Waitlist mode

Before using the `<Waitlist />` component, you must enable **Waitlist** mode in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Waitlist settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/waitlist) page.
1. Toggle on **Enable waitlist** and select **Save**.

  ## Example

  > [!WARNING]
  > Before using the `<Waitlist />` component, you must provide the `waitlistUrl` prop either in the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/reference/components/clerk-provider#properties) or [`<SignIn />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in#properties) component to ensure proper functionality.

  The following example includes a basic implementation of the `<Waitlist />` component. You can use this as a starting point for your own implementation.

  <If sdk="nextjs">
    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/waitlist/[[...waitlist]]/page.tsx' }}

  </If>

  <If sdk="react">
    ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/App.tsx' }}
    import { Waitlist } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

    function App() {
      return <Waitlist />
    }

    export default App
    ```
  </If>

  <If sdk="astro">
    ```astro {{ filename: 'pages/waitlist.astro' }}
