How to setup social connection with Spotify

## Overview

Adding social connection with Spotify to your app with Clerk is simple - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

> We currently don't support preconfigured shared OAuth credentials for development instances. You will have to use your own credentials

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your Spotify account.

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/get-started/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Spotify developer account. To create one, [click here](https://developer.spotify.com/).
