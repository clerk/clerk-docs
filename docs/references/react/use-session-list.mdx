# `useSessionList()`

The `useSessionList()` hook returns an array of [`Session`](/docs/references/javascript/session) objects that have been registered on the client device.

## `useSessionList()` returns

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `isLoaded` | `boolean` | A boolean that is set to `false` until Clerk loads and initializes. |
| `setActive()` | <code>(params: [SetActiveParams](#set-active-params)) => Promise\<void></code> | A function that sets the active session and/or organization. |
| `sessions` | [`Session[]`](/docs/references/javascript/session) | A list of sessions that have been registered on the client device. |

### `SetActiveParams`

| `session` | <code>[Session](/docs/references/javascript/session) \| string \| null</code> | The session resource or session ID (string version) to be set as active. If `null`, the current session is deleted. |
| `organization` | <code>[Organization](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) \| string \| null</code> | The organization resource or organization ID (string version) to be set as active in the current session. If `null`, the currently active organization is removed as active. |

## How to use the `useSessionList()` hook

The following example demonstrates how to use the `useSessionList()` hook to retrieve a list of sessions that have been registered on the client device. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state, and the `sessions` property is used to display the number of times the user has visited the page.

```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'home.tsx' }}
import { useSessionList } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export default function Home() {
  const { isLoaded, sessions } = useSessionList();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // handle loading state
    return null;
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Welcome back. You have been here
      {sessions.length} times before.
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```
