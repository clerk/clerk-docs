---

The `UserButton` component is a circular button that displays the signed-in user's profile image. When tapped, it presents a sheet with the `UserProfileView`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `UserButton` only appears when a user is signed in.

## Usage

The following examples show how to use the `UserButton` component in your iOS app.

### Basic usage

```swift
struct HomeView: View {
  @Environment(\.clerk) private var clerk

  var body: some View {
    ZStack {
      if clerk.user != nil {
        UserButton()
          .frame(width: 36, height: 36)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### In a navigation toolbar

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  @Environment(\.clerk) private var clerk
  
  var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
      VStack {
        Text("Welcome!")
      }
      .toolbar {
        ToolbarItem(placement: .navigationBarTrailing) {
          if clerk.user != nil {
            UserButton()
              .frame(width: 36, height: 36)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Customization

To learn how to customize Clerk iOS components, see the [ClerkTheme documentation](/docs/references/ios/clerk-theme).

If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the custom flow guides.
