title: '`authenticateRequest()`'
description: Use Clerk's Backend SDK to verify a token passed from the frontend.
---

{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/tokens/request.ts#L62 */}

Authenticates a token passed from the frontend. Networkless if the `jwtKey` is provided. Otherwise, performs a network call to retrieve the JWKS from the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/JWKS#operation/GetJWKS){{ target: '_blank' }}.

```ts
function authenticateRequest(
  request: Request,
  options: AuthenticateRequestOptions,
): Promise<RequestState>
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `request`
  - `Request`

  `Request` object

  ---

  - `options?`
  - [`AuthenticateRequestOptions`](#authenticate-request-options)

  Optional options to configure the authentication.
</Properties>

## `AuthenticateRequestOptions`

It is recommended to set these options as [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#api-and-sdk-configuration) where possible, and then pass them to the function. For example, you can set the `secretKey` option using the `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variable, and then pass it to the function like this: `createClerkClient({ secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY })`.

> [!WARNING]
> You must provide either `jwtKey` or `secretKey`.
>
> For better security, it's highly recommended to explicitly set the `authorizedParties` option when authorizing requests. The value should be a list of domains that are allowed to make requests to your application. Not setting this value can open your application to [CSRF attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf).

<Properties>
  - `secretKey?`
  - `string`

  The Clerk Secret Key from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

  ---

  - `publishableKey?`
  - `string`

  The Clerk Publishable Key from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

  ---

  - `jwtKey?`
  - `string`

  Used to verify the session token in a networkless manner. Supply the **JWKS Public Key** from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard. For more information, refer to [Manual JWT verification](/docs/backend-requests/manual-jwt).

  ---

  - `acceptsToken?`
  - `TokenType`

  Determines what type of authentication token(s) to verify. Valid values are:

  - `'session_token'` - authenticates a user session.
  - `'oauth_token'` - authenticates a machine request using OAuth.
  - `'machine_token'` - authenticates a machine request.
  - `'api_key'` - authenticates a machine request using API keys.

  If set to `any`, the function will authenticate both user sessions and machine requests. Defaults to `session_token`.

  ---

  - `domain?`
  - `string`

  The domain for the application. For development, you can pass the localhost your application is running on. For example: `localhost:3001`

  ---

  - `isSatellite?`
  - `boolean`

  Set to `true` if the instance is a satellite domain in a multi-domain setup.

  ---

  - `proxyUrl?`
  - `string`

  The proxy URL from a multi-domain setup.

  ---

  - `signInUrl?`
  - `string`

  The sign-in URL from a multi-domain setup.

  ---

  - `signUpUrl?`
  - `string`

  It's recommended to use sign-up URL from a multi-domain setup.

  ---

  - `afterSignInUrl?`
  - `string`

  Full URL or path to navigate to after successful sign in. Defaults to `/`.

  ---

  - `afterSignUpUrl?`
  - `string`

  Full URL or path to navigate to after successful sign up. Defaults to `/`.

  ---

  - `audience?`
  - `string | string[]`

  A string or list of [audiences](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3).

  ---

  - `authorizedParties?`
  - `string[]`

  An allowlist of origins to verify against, to protect your application from the subdomain cookie leaking attack. For example: `['http://localhost:3000', 'https://example.com']`

  ---

  - `clockSkewInMs?`
  - `number`

  Specifies the allowed time difference (in milliseconds) between the Clerk server (which generates the token) and the clock of the user's application server when validating a token. Defaults to 5000 ms (5 seconds).

  ---

  - `jwksCacheTtlInMs?` (deprecated)
  - `number`

  Deprecated. Specifying a cache TTL is now a no-op.

  ---

  - `skipJwksCache?`
  - `boolean`

  A flag to skip ignore cache and always fetch JWKS before each jwt verification.
</Properties>

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `isAuthenticated`
  - `boolean`

  Indicates whether the incoming request is authenticated.
</Properties>

## Examples

<Tabs items={["Backend SDK on its own", "With other Clerk SDKs"]}>
  <Tab>
    If you are using the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) on its own, you need to provide the `secretKey` and `publishableKey` to `createClerkClient()` so that it is passed to `authenticateRequest()`. You can set these values as [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#clerk-publishable-and-secret-keys) and then pass them to the function.

    ```tsx
    import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend'

    export async function GET(req: Request) {
      const clerkClient = createClerkClient({
        secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY,
        publishableKey: process.env.CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
      })

      const { isAuthenticated } = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(req, {
        authorizedParties: ['https://example.com'],
      })

      if (!isAuthenticated) {
        return Response.json({ status: 401 })
      }

      // Add logic to perform protected actions

      return Response.json({ message: 'This is a reply' })
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    `authenticateRequest()` requires `publishableKey` to be set. If you are importing `clerkClient` from a higher-level SDK, such as Next.js, then `clerkClient` infers the `publishableKey` from your [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#clerk-publishable-and-secret-keys). The following example uses Next.js, but the same logic applies for other frameworks.

    ```tsx
    import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    const client = await clerkClient()

    export async function GET(req: Request) {
      const { isAuthenticated } = await client.authenticateRequest(req, {
        authorizedParties: ['https://example.com'],
      })

      if (!isAuthenticated) {
        return Response.json({ status: 401 })
      }

      // Perform protected actions
      // Add logic to perform protected actions

      return Response.json({ message: 'This is a reply' })
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Machine authentication

By default, `authenticateRequest()` will authenticate a session request. To authenticate a machine request, you need to set the `acceptsToken` option to a machine token type, such as `'api_key'`, `'oauth_token'` or `'machine_token'`.

```tsx
import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend'

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const clerkClient = createClerkClient({
    secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY,
    publishableKey: process.env.CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
  })

  const { isAuthenticated } = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(request, {
    acceptsToken: 'oauth_token',
  })

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return Response.json({ status: 401 })
  }

  // Add logic to perform protected actions
  return Response.json({ message: 'This is a machine-to-machine reply' })
}
```

### Networkless token verification

{/* Note: this example is duped from /authenticate-request. Probably a good opportunity to use a partial here */}

The following example uses the `authenticateRequest()` method with the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) to verify the token passed by the frontend, and performs a networkless authentication by passing `jwtKey`. This will verify if the user is signed into the application or not.
