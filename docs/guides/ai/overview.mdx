Clerk provides support for building AI-powered applications with secure authentication. Whether you're using AI-powered development tools to build applications with Clerk, or building a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that allows AI agents to access user data, these guides cover everything you need to get started.

### Use Clerk's MCP server

Clerk provides its own MCP server that helps AI coding assistants provide accurate SDK snippets and implementation patterns. This is useful when building authentication features with Clerk in AI tools. Learn how to [connect to Clerk's MCP server](/docs/guides/ai/mcp/clerk-mcp-server).

### Build your own MCP server

Clerk supports MCP through dynamic client registration (for registering MCP servers programmatically), consent screens (for secure user authorization), and SDK support, making it an ideal authorization server for MCP implementations.

Build your own MCP server that uses Clerk for authenticatioZ and authorization following these guides:

- [Build an MCP server](/docs/guides/ai/mcp/build-mcp-server)
- [Connect an MCP client](/docs/guides/ai/mcp/connect-mcp-client)

## AI prompts

Clerk's AI prompt library provides curated prompts to help you work more efficiently with AI-powered development tools like Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and more. These prompts guide AI assistants in helping you implement Clerk's features correctly.

To learn more, see the [AI prompts](/docs/guides/ai/prompts) guide.
