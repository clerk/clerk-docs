The `useClerk()` hook provides access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object, allowing you to build alternatives to any Clerk Component.

## Returns

The `useClerk()` hook returns the `Clerk` object, which includes all the methods and properties listed in the [`Clerk` reference](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk).

## How to use the `useClerk()` hook

The following example uses the `useClerk()` hook to access the `clerk` object. The `clerk` object is used to call the [`openSignIn()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk#sign-in) method to open the sign-in modal.

```tsx {{ filename: 'src/Home.tsx' }}
import { useClerk } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

export default function Home() {
  const clerk = useClerk()

  return <button onClick={() => clerk.openSignIn({})}>Sign in</button>
}
```
