# Webhooks overview

Clerk webhooks allow you to receive event notifications from Clerk. Clerk will send a `POST` request to a URL you specify when certain events happen in your Clerk account.

Clerk uses [Svix](https://svix.com/) to send our webhooks.

You can find the Webhook signing secret when you click on the endpoint you created on the **[Webhooks](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks)** page in the Clerk Dashboard.

## Payload structure

The payload of the message includes the type of the event in the type property.

The `data` property contains the actual payload sent by Clerk. The payload can be a different object depending on the `event` type. For example, for `user.*` events, the payload will always be the User object . For `organization.*` event type, the payload will always be an organization (except for when it is deleted).

Below is an example of a webhook payload for a `user.created` event:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "birthday": "",
    "created_at": 1654012591514,
    "email_addresses": [
      {
        "email_address": "example@example.org",
        "id": "idn_29w83yL7CwVlJXylYLxcslromF1",
        "linked_to": [],
        "object": "email_address",
        "verification": {
          "status": "verified",
          "strategy": "ticket"
        }
      }
    ],
    "external_accounts": [],
    "external_id": "567772",
    "first_name": "Example",
    "gender": "",
    "id": "user_29w83sxmDNGwOuEthce5gg56FcC",
    "last_name": "Example",
    "locked": false,
    "last_sign_in_at": 1654012591514,
    "object": "user",
    "password_enabled": true,
    "phone_numbers": [],
    "primary_email_address_id": "idn_29w83yL7CwVlJXylYLxcslromF1",
    "primary_phone_number_id": null,
    "primary_web3_wallet_id": null,
    "private_metadata": {},
    "profile_image_url": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar?d=mp",
    "public_metadata": {},
    "two_factor_enabled": false,
    "unsafe_metadata": {},
    "updated_at": 1654012591835,
    "username": null,
    "web3_wallets": []
  },
  "object": "event",
  "type": "user.created"
}
```

## TypeScript support

Clerk provides the types as part of our SDK offering. Below is an example of type usage in a webhook handler:

```tsx
import type { WebhookEvent } from "@clerk/nextjs/server"

const handler = req => {
  const evt = req.body.evt as WebhookEvent;
  switch (evt.type) {
    case 'user.created':
      // UserJSON.first_name is a string
      const firstName = evt.data.first_name
      // UserJSON.last_name is a string
      const lastName = evt.data.last_name
      // UserJSON.email_addresses is an array of EmailAddressJSON
      const emails = evt.data.email_addresses;
  }
}
```

## Handling delivery issues

### Retry

Svix will use a set schedule and retry any webhooks that fail. To see the up-to-date schedule, check out the [Svix Retry Schedule](https://docs.svix.com/retries).

If Svix is attempting and failing to send a webhook, and that endpoint is removed or disabled from the **[Webhooks](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks)** page of the Clerk Dashboard, then the attempts will also be disabled.

### Replay

If a webhook message or multiple webhook messages fail to send, you have an option to reply the webhook messages. This protects against your service having downtime or against a misconfigured endpoint. To replay webhook messages, in the Clerk Dashboard, go to the **[Webhooks](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks)** page. Select the affected Endpoint. From the **Attempted Messages** section, locate a message you want to reply  to, click the menu icon on the right side, and then select **Replay**.

#### Replay options

From the Replay Messages menu, you will have 3 options.
1. Resend the specific message you selected.
2. Resend all failed messages since the first failed message in that date range.
3. Resend all missing messages since the first failed message in that date range.

## Sync data to your database

You can find a guide on how to use webhooks to sync your data to your database [here](/docs/integrations/webhooks/sync-data).

## Protecting your webhooks from abuse

To ensure that the api route receiving the webhook can only be hit by your app, there are a few protections you can put in place:

- **Verify the request signature**: Svix webhook requests are [signed](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Digital_signature) and can be verified to ensure the request is not malicious. To learn more, check out Svix's guide on [how to verify webhooks with the svix libraries](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how) or [how to verify webooks manually](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how-manual).

- **Only accept requests coming from [Svix's webhook IPs](https://docs.svix.com/webhook-ips.json)**:  To further prevent attackers from flooding your servers or wasting your compute, you can ensure that your webhook-receiving api routes only accept requests coming from [Svix's webhook IPs](https://docs.svix.com/webhook-ips.json), rejecting all other requests.
