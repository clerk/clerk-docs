> [!CAUTION]
> Clerk stores the session token in a cookie, and most browsers cap cookie size at [**4KB**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2109#section-6.3). After accounting for the size of Clerk's default claims, the cookie can support **up to 1.2KB** of custom claims. Exceeding this limit will cause the cookie to not be set, which will break your app as Clerk depends on cookies to work properly. [Learn more](/docs/guides/sessions/session-tokens#size-limitations).
