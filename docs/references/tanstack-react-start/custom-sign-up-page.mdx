title: Build your own sign-up page for your TanStack React Start app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add a custom sign-up page to your TanStack React Start app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

By default, the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/references/tanstack-react-start/custom-sign-in-or-up-page) component handles signing in and signing up, but if you'd like to have a dedicated sign-up page, this guide shows you how to use the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component to build a custom sign-up page.

To set up a single sign-in-or-up page, follow the [custom sign-in-or-up page guide](/docs/references/tanstack-react-start/custom-sign-in-or-up-page).

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component on a dedicated sign-up page using the [TanStack Router catch-all route](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/routing/routing-concepts#splat--catch-all-routes).

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/routes/sign-up.$.tsx' }}
  import { SignUp } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'
  import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/sign-up/$')({
    component: Page,
  })

  function Page() {
    return <SignUp />
  }
  ```

  ## Configure your sign-up page

  - Set the `CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` environment variable to tell Clerk where the `<SignUp />` component is being hosted.

  There are other environment variables that you can set to customize Clerk's redirect behavior, such as `CLERK_SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL`. Learn more about these environment variables and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/custom-redirects).

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
  ```

  ## Visit your new pages

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/sign-up).
