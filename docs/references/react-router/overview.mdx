description: Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your React Router application.
---

Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your React Router application. This documentation covers the capabilities and methods available for Clerk's React Router SDK.

## Client-side helpers

Because Clerk React Router is a wrapper around Clerk React, you can utilize the hooks that Clerk React provides. These hooks give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object, and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. You can learn more about these hooks [in the React SDK reference](/docs/references/react/overview).

## Server-side helpers

The below methods and references show how to integrate Clerk features into applications that take advantage of TanStack Start server functions and API routes.

- [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/react-router/get-auth)

### `Auth` object

The `getAuth()` returns an `Auth` object. This JavaScript object contains important information like session data, your user's ID, as well as their organization ID. Learn more about the [`Auth` object](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }}.
