# First factor

These are all methods on the [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) class that allow you to handle the first factor of a multi-factor authentication flow.

## `prepareFirstFactor()`

```typescript
function prepareFirstFactor(params: PrepareFirstFactorParams): Promise<SignIn>;
```

Begins the first factor verification process. This is a required step in order to complete a sign in, as users should be verified at least by one factor of authentication.

Common scenarios are one-time code (OTP) or social account (SSO) verification. This is determined by the accepted `strategy` parameter values. Each authentication identifier supports different strategies.

### `PrepareFirstFactorParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `strategy` | `string` | The `strategy` value depends on the object's `identifier` value. Each authentication identifier supports different verification strategies. Possible `strategy` values are: <ul><li>`email_link`: User will receive an email link. The `email_address_id` parameter can also be specified to select one of the user's known email addresses.</li><li>`email_code`: User will receive a one-time authentication code via email. At least one email address should be on file for the user. The `email_address_id` parameter can also be specified to select one of the user's known email addresses.</li><li>`phone_code`: User will receive a one-time authentication code in their phone, via SMS. At least one phone number should be on file for the user. The `phone_number_id` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known phone numbers the SMS will go to.</li><li>`web3_metamask_signature`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's web3 wallet public address. The `web3_wallet_id` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known web3 wallets will be used. Currently Clerk supports [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).</li><li>`oauth_<provider>`: The user will be authenticated with their Social login account. See available [OAuth Strategies](/docs/references/javascript/types/oauth-strategy).</li></ul> |
| `emailAddressId?` | `string` | Unique identifier for the user's email address that will receive an email message with the one-time authentication code. This parameter will work only when the `email_code` strategy is specified. |
| `phoneNumberId?` | `string` | Unique identifier for the user's phone number that will receive an SMS message with the one-time authentication code. This parameter will work only when the `phone_code` strategy is specified. |
| `web3WalletId?` | `string` | Unique identifier for the user's web3 wallet public address. This parameter will work only when the `web3_metamask_signature` strategy is specified. |
| `redirectUrl?` | `string` | The URL that the OAuth provider should redirect to, on successful authorization on their part. This parameter is required only if you set the `strategy` param to an OAuth strategy like `oauth_<provider>`. |
| `actionCompleteRedirectUrl?` | `string` | The URL that the user will be redirected to, after successful authorization from the OAuth provider and Clerk sign in. This parameter is required only if you set the `strategy` param to an OAuth strategy like `oauth_<provider>`. |

### Returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <code>Promise\<[SignIn][signin-ref]\></code> | This method returns a `Promise` which resolves with a [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object. Check the `firstFactorVerification` attribute for the status of the first factor verification process. |

## `attemptFirstFactor()`

```typescript
function attemptFirstFactor(params: AttemptFirstFactorParams): Promise<SignIn>;
```

Attempts to complete the first factor verification process. This is a required step in order to complete a sign in, as users should be verified at least by one factor of authentication.

Make sure that a [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object already exists before you call this method, either by first calling `SignIn.create` or `SignIn.prepareFirstFactor`. The only strategy that does not require a verification to have already been prepared before attempting to complete it, is the `password` strategy.

Depending on the strategy that was selected when the verification was prepared, the method parameters should be different.

### `AttemptFirstFactorParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `strategy` | `string` | The `strategy` value depends on the object's `identifier` value. Each authentication identifier supports different verification strategies. Possible `strategy` values are: <ul><li>`email_code`: User will receive a one-time authentication code via email. At least one email address should be on file for the user. The `email_address_id` parameter can also be specified to select one of the user's known email addresses.</li><li>`phone_code`: User will receive a one-time authentication code in their phone, via SMS. At least one phone number should be on file for the user. The `phone_number_id` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known phone numbers the SMS will go to.</li><li>`password`: The verification will attempt to be completed with the user's password.</li><li>`web3_metamask_signature`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's web3 wallet public address. The `web3_wallet_id` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known web3 wallets will be used. Currently Clerk supports [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).</li></ul> |
| `code?` | `string` | The one-time code that was sent to the user as part of this verification step. This parameter is required only when `strategy` is set to `email_code` or `phone_code`. |
| `password?` | `string` | The user's password string. This parameter is required only when `strategy` is set to `password`. |
| `signature?` | `string` | Web3 wallet generated signature to be verified. This parameter is required only for web3 verification strategies. |

### Returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <code>Promise\<[SignIn][signin-ref]\></code> | This method returns a `Promise` which resolves with a [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object. Check the `firstFactorVerification` attribute for the status of the first factor verification process. |
