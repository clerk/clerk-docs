---

The `SignIn` object holds the state of the current sign-in and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-in process. It is used to manage the sign-in lifecycle, including the first and second factor verification, and the creation of a new session.

The following steps outline the sign-in process:

1. Initiate the sign-in process by collecting the user's authentication information and passing the appropriate parameters to the [`create()`](#create) method.
1. Prepare the [first factor verification](#first-factor). Users _must_ complete a first factor verification. This can be something like providing a password, an email link, a one-time code (OTP), a Web3 wallet address, or providing proof of their identity through an external social account (SSO/OAuth).
1. Attempt to complete the first factor verification.
1. Optionally, if you have enabled [multi-factor](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options) for your application, you will need to prepare the [second factor verification](#second-factor) for users who have set up 2FA for their account.
1. Attempt to complete the second factor verification.
1. If verification is successful, set the newly created session as the active session by passing the `SignIn.createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object.

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `status`
  - `SignInStatus`

  The current status of the sign-in. `SignInStatus` supports the following values:

  - `'complete'`: The user is signed in and the custom flow can proceed to `setActive()` to create a session.
  - `'needs_identifier'`: The user's identifier (e.g., email address, phone number, username) hasn't been provided.
  - `'needs_first_factor'`: One of the following [first factor verification strategies](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/first-factor) is missing: `'email_link'`, `'email_code'`, `'phone_code'`, `'web3_metamask_signature'`, `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'` or `'oauth_provider'`.
  - `'needs_second_factor'`: One of the following [second factor verification strategies](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/second-factor) is missing: `'phone_code'` or `'totp'`.
  - `'needs_new_password'`: The user needs to set a new password.

  ---

  - `supportedIdentifiers`
  - `SignInIdentifier[]`

  Array of all the authentication identifiers that are supported for this sign in. `SignInIdentifier` supports the following values:

  - `'email_address'`
  - `'phone_number'`
  - `'web3_wallet'`
  - `'username'`

  ---

  - `identifier`
  - `string | null`

  **Optional** if the `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. **Required** otherwise. The authentication identifier value for the current sign-in.

  ---

  - `supportedFirstFactors`
  - <code>[SignInFirstFactor](/docs/references/javascript/types/sign-in-first-factor)\[]</code>

  Array of the first factors that are supported in the current sign-in. Each factor contains information about the verification strategy that can be used. See the [`SignInFirstFactor`](/docs/references/javascript/types/sign-in-first-factor) type reference for more information.

  ---

  - `supportedSecondFactors`
  - <code>[SignInSecondFactor](/docs/references/javascript/types/sign-in-second-factor)\[]</code>

  Array of the second factors that are supported in the current sign-in. Each factor contains information about the verification strategy that can be used. This property is populated only when the first factor is verified. See the [`SignInSecondFactor`](/docs/references/javascript/types/sign-in-second-factor) type reference for more information.

  ---

  - `firstFactorVerification`
  - [`Verification`](/docs/references/javascript/types/verification)

  The state of the verification process for the selected first factor. Initially, this property contains an empty verification object, since there is no first factor selected. You need to call the [`prepareFirstFactor`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/first-factor#prepare-first-factor) method in order to start the verification process.

  ---

  - `secondFactorVerification`
  - [`Verification`](/docs/references/javascript/types/verification)

  The state of the verification process for the selected second factor. Initially, this property contains an empty verification object, since there is no second factor selected. For the `phone_code` strategy, you need to call the [`prepareSecondFactor`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/second-factor#prepare-second-factor) method in order to start the verification process. For the `totp` strategy, you can directly attempt.

  ---

  - `userData`
  - `UserData`

  An object containing information about the user of the current sign-in. This property is populated only once an identifier is given to the `SignIn` object.

  ---

  - `createdSessionId`
  - `string | null`

  The identifier of the session that was created upon completion of the current sign-in. The value of this property is `null` if the sign-in status is not `'complete'`.
</Properties>

## Methods

### `create()`

Returns a new `SignIn` object based on the `params` you pass to it, and stores the sign-in lifecycle state in the `status` property. Use this method to initiate the sign-in process.

What you must pass to `params` depends on which [sign-in options](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options) you have enabled in your Clerk application instance.

Optionally, you can complete the sign-in process, fully authenticating the user in one step, if you supply the required fields to `create()`. Otherwise, Clerk's sign-in process provides great flexibility and allows users to easily create multi-step sign-in flows.

> [!WARNING]
> Once the sign-in process is complete, pass the `createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object. This will set the newly created session as the active session.

```typescript
function create(params: SignInCreateParams): Promise<SignIn>
```

#### `SignInCreateParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy?`
  - `'password' | 'email_link' | 'email_code' | 'phone_code' | 'oauth_<provider>' | 'saml' | 'enterprise_sso' | 'passkey' | 'web3_metamask_signature' | 'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature' | 'web3_okx_wallet_signature' | 'ticket' | 'google_one_tap'`

  The first factor verification strategy to use in the sign-in flow. Depends on the `SignIn.identifier` value. Each authentication identifier supports different verification strategies. The following strategies are supported:

  - `'password'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's password.
  - `'email_link'`: User will receive an email magic link via email. The `identifier` parameter can also be specified to select one of the user's known email addresses. The `redirectUrl` parameter can also be specified.
  - `'email_code'`: User will receive a one-time authentication code via email. The `identifier` parameter can also be specified to select one of the user's known email addresses.
  - `'phone_code'`: User will receive a one-time authentication code via SMS. The `identifier` parameter can also be specified to select one of the user's known phone numbers.
  - `'oauth_<provider>'`: The user will be authenticated with their [social connection account](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview). See a list of [supported values for `<provider>`](/docs/references/javascript/types/sso).
  - `'saml'` (deprecated): **Deprecated in favor of `'enterprise_sso'`.** The user will be authenticated with their [SAML account](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/overview#saml).
  - `'enterprise_sso'`: The user will be authenticated either through SAML or OIDC depending on the configuration of their [enterprise SSO account](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/overview).
  - `'passkey'`: The user will be authenticated with their [passkey](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#passkeys).
  - `'web3_metamask_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [Metamask](/docs/authentication/web3/metamask). The `identifier` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known Web3 wallets will be used.
  - `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [Coinbase Wallet](/docs/authentication/web3/coinbase-wallet). The `identifier` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known Web3 wallets will be used.
  - `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [OKX Wallet](/docs/authentication/web3/okx-wallet). The `identifier` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known Web3 wallets will be used.
  - `'ticket'`: The user will be authenticated via the ticket _or token_ generated from the Backend API.
  - `'google_one_tap'`: The user will be authenticated with the Google One Tap UI. It's recommended to use [`authenticateWithGoogleOneTap()`](/docs/components/authentication/google-one-tap#authenticate-with-google-one-tap) instead, as it will also set the user's current session as active for you.

  ---

  - `identifier`
  - `string`

  The authentication identifier for the sign-in. This can be the value of the user's email address, phone number, username, or Web3 wallet address.

  ---

  - `password?`
  - `string`

  The user's password. Only supported if `strategy` is set to `'password'` and [password](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#authentication-strategies) is enabled.

  ---

  - `ticket?`
  - `string`

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'ticket'`. The [ticket _or token_](/docs/custom-flows/embedded-email-links#generate-a-sign-in-token) generated from the Backend API.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  If `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`, this specifies the full URL or path that the OAuth provider should redirect to after successful authorization on their part. Typically, this will be a simple `/sso-callback` route that either calls [`Clerk.handleRedirectCallback`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/handle-navigation#handle-redirect-callback) or mounts the [`<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />`](/docs/components/control/authenticate-with-callback) component. See the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/oauth-connections) for implementation details.

  If `strategy` is set to `'email_link'`, this specifies the URL that the user will be redirected to when they visit the email link. See the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/email-links) for implementation details.

  ---

  - `actionCompleteRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  **Optional** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The URL that the user will be redirected to, after successful authorization from the OAuth provider and Clerk sign-in.

  ---

  - `transfer?`
  - `boolean`

  When set to `true`, the `SignIn` will attempt to retrieve information from the active `SignUp` instance and use it to complete the sign-in process. This is useful when you want to seamlessly transition a user from a sign-up attempt to a sign-in attempt.

  ---

  - `oidcPrompt?`
  - `string`

  **Optional** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The value to pass to the [OIDC `prompt` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=prompt,reauthentication%20and%20consent.) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.

  ---

  - `oidcLoginHint?`
  - `string`

  **Optional** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The value to pass to the [OIDC `login_hint` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=login_hint,in%20\(if%20necessary\).) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.
</Properties>

### `resetPassword()`

Resets a user's password.

```typescript
function resetPassword(params: ResetPasswordParams): Promise<SignIn>
```

#### `ResetPasswordParams`

<Properties>
  - `password`
  - `string`

  The user's current password.

  ---

  - `signOutOfOtherSessions?`
  - `boolean | undefined`

  If `true`, log the user out of all other authenticated sessions.
</Properties>

### `createEmailLinkFlow()`

Sets up a sign in with email link flow. Calling `createemailLinkFlow()` will return two functions. The first function is async and starts the email link flow, preparing a email link verification. It sends the email link email and starts polling for verification results. The signature is `startEmailLinkFlow({ redirectUrl: string, emailAddressId: string }) => Promise<SignInResource>`.

The second function can be used to stop polling at any time, allowing for full control of the flow and cleanup. The signature is `cancelEmailLinkFlow() => void`.

```typescript
function createEmailLinkFlow(): {
  startEmailLinkFlow: (params: SignInStartEmailLinkFlowParams) => Promise<SignIn>
  cancelEmailLinkFlow: () => void
}
```

#### Returns

`createEmailLinkFlow` returns an object with two functions:

<Properties>
  - `startEmailLinkFlow`
  - <code>(params: [SignInStartEmailLinkFlowParams](#sign-in-start-email-link-flow-params)) => Promise\<SignIn></code>

  Function to start the email link flow. It prepares an email link verification and polls for the verification result.

  ---

  - `cancelEmailLinkFlow`
  - `() => void`

  Function to cleanup the email link flow. Stops waiting for verification results.
</Properties>

#### `SignInStartEmailLinkFlowParams`

<Properties>
  - `emailAddressId`
  - `string`

  The ID of the user's email address that's going to be used as the first factor identification for verification.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl`
  - `string`

  The full URL that the user will be redirected to when they visit the email link.
</Properties>
