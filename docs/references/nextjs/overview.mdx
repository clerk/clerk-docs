title: Clerk Next.js SDK
description: Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Next.js application.
---

Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your Next.js application. This reference lists the features and methods available in Clerk's Next.js SDK.

## Client-side helpers

Because the Next.js SDK is built on top of the Clerk React SDK, you can utilize the hooks that the React SDK provides. These hooks give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. Learn more about these hooks in the [React SDK reference](/docs/references/react/overview).

## Server-side helpers

### App router

Clerk provides first-class support for the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app). The following references show how to integrate Clerk features into apps using the latest App Router and React Server Components features.

- [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth)
- [`currentUser()`](/docs/references/nextjs/current-user)
- [Route Handlers](/docs/references/nextjs/route-handlers)
- [Server Actions](/docs/references/nextjs/server-actions)

### Pages router

Clerk continues to provide drop-in support for the Next.js Pages Router. In addition to the main Clerk integration, the following references are available for apps using Pages Router.

- [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth)
- [`buildClerkProps()`](/docs/references/nextjs/build-clerk-props)

## Other references

### `Auth` object

Both `auth()` (App Router) and `getAuth()` (Pages Router) return an `Auth` object. This JavaScript object contains important information like the current user's session ID, user ID, and organization ID. Learn more about the [`Auth` object](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }}.

### `clerkMiddleware()`

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Next.js application through middleware. It allows you to integrate authorization into both the client and server of your application. You can learn more [here](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware).

### Demo repositories

To see an example of Clerk's features, such as user and organization management, integrated in a single application, explore the Clerk + Next.js demo repositories:
