<Properties>
  - `audience?`
  - `string | string[]`

  A string or list of [audiences](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3). If passed, it is checked against the `aud` claim in the token.

  ---

  - `authorizedParties?`
  - `string[]`

  An allowlist of origins to verify against, to protect your application from the subdomain cookie leaking attack. For example: `['http://localhost:3000', 'https://example.com']`

  ---

  - `clockSkewInMs?`
  - `number`

  Specifies the allowed time difference (in milliseconds) between the Clerk server (which generates the token) and the clock of the user's application server when validating a token. Defaults to 5000 ms (5 seconds).
