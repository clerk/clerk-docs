description: A list of Clerk's comprehensive suite of hooks for managing authentication, sessions, sign-in and sign-up flows, organizations, and reverification.

Clerk offers a comprehensive suite of hooks that expose low-level access to autentication, session management, and multi-tenancy. With Clerk hooks, you can access and manage user data, handle sign-in and sign-up flows, control session management, and implement advanced flows like session reverification for sensitive actions. By using these hooks, you can extend or replace Clerk's built-in components and customize how authentication behaves in your application.
