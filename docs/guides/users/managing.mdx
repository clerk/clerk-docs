description: Learn how to manage your users in your Clerk application.
---

To get started, it's important to first understand Clerk's [`User` object](/docs/references/javascript/user).

<Include src="_partials/user-object" />

For more information on the `User` object, such as helper methods for retrieving and updating user information and authentication status, see the [reference docs](/docs/references/javascript/user). The `User` object is also available in the backend, but it looks slightly different. For more information, see the [Backend `User` object reference docs](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-user).

## Manage users

You can manage your users [in the Clerk Dashboard](#in-the-clerk-dashboard), or [in your app](#in-your-app).

### In the Clerk Dashboard

To manage users in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Users**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=users) page.

### In your app

You can manage users in your app either through the [frontend](#in-the-frontend) or [backend](#in-the-backend).

#### In the frontend

Depending on the level of abstraction you need, you can manage users in the frontend using Clerk's prebuilt components, React hooks, or lower-level JavaScript methods.

- Prebuilt components: Clerk provides the prebuilt components [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button) and [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/components/user/user-profile) to help your users manage their profile data.
- Hooks: Because Clerk's React-based SDKs are built on top of the Clerk React SDK, you can use the [hooks](/docs/references/react/overview#custom-hooks) that the React SDK provides. These hooks include access to the `User` object and helpful methods for managing user authentication and profile data.
- JavaScript methods: If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

#### In the backend

The [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) exposes the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} resources and low-level authentication utilities for JavaScript environments.

There are many operations available for managing users, such as `getUser()`, `createUser()`, and `deleteUser()`. For more information, see the [Backend SDK reference docs](/docs/references/backend/overview).

## Create users

There are two ways to create users in Clerk: [in the Clerk Dashboard](#in-the-clerk-dashboard) or [using the Backend API](#using-the-backend-api).

### In the Clerk Dashboard

To create users in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the top in the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Users**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=users).
1. Select **Create user**.
1. Enter the required user details and select **Create**.

### Using the Backend API

You can create users in your app using Clerk's Backend API.

Use the following tabs to see examples of how to create users using one of the following:

- Frontend SDKs, such as Next.js, React, or Remix
- Express
- cURL

<Tabs items={["Backend SDK", "Express", "cURL"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example shows how to create a user using the JavaScript Backend SDK's [`createUser()`](/docs/references/backend/user/create-user) method from the `users` sub-api of the `clerkClient` instance.

    <Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

    ```ts {{ filename: 'route.ts' }}
    export async function POST() {
      try {
        const user = await clerkClient.users.createUser({
          emailAddress: ['test@example.com'],
          password: 'password',
        })
        return Response.json({ message: 'User created', user })
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(error)
        return Response.json({ error: 'Error creating user' })
      }
    }
    ```

    <If sdk="nextjs">
      If you're using Next.js, you must `await` the instantiation of the `clerkClient` instance, like so:

      ```ts
      const client = await clerkClient()

      const response = await client.users.createUser()
      ```
    </If>
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```ts {{ filename: 'create-user.ts' }}
    import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/express'

    app.post('/createUser', async (req, res) => {
      const userData = req.body

      try {
        const user = await clerkClient.users.createUser(userData)
        res.status(200).json({ message: 'User created', user })
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(error)
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error creating user' })
      }
    })
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    curl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/users' -X POST -H 'Authorization:Bearer {{secret}}' -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{
      "email_address": ["test@example.com"],
      "password": "my-secure-password"
    }'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Delete users

There are two ways to delete users in Clerk: [in the Clerk Dashboard](#in-the-clerk-dashboard) or [using the Backend API](#using-the-backend-api).

### In the Clerk Dashboard

To delete users in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. At the top of the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Users**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=users).
1. You can either select the user and then in the side navigation menu, select **Delete user**, or select the menu icon on the right side of the user's row and select **Delete user**.

### Using the Backend API

You can delete users in your app using Clerk's Backend API.

      } catch (error) {
        console.log(error)
        return Response.json({ error: 'Error deleting user' })
      }
    }
