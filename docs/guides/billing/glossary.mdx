## Downgrade

When a user or organization undergoes a price transition to a new price that is less expensive than the current price, they are downgraded to the new price at the end of the current billing period. The new price can be for the same plan or a different plan than the user or organization is currently subscribed to.

## Feature

A specific aspect of an application that is conferred by a plan. Can be used to determine if a user or organization has access to the specific aspect of the application.

## Upgrade

When a user or organization undergoes a price transition to a new price that is more expensive than the current price, they are upgraded to the new price immediately, prorated for the time remaining in their current billing period. The new price can be for the same plan or a different plan than the user or organization is currently subscribed to.
