# Integrate Supabase with Clerk

The first step is to create a new Clerk application from your Clerk Dashboard if you haven’t done so already. You can choose whichever authentication strategy and social login providers you prefer. For more information, check out our [Set up your application](/docs/guides/setup-clerk) guide.

After your Clerk application has been created, go to the Clerk Dashboard and navigate to the **[JWT Templates](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=jwt-templates)** page. Click on the **New template** button to create a new template based on Supabase.

  alt="The JWT Templates page in the Clerk Dashboard. The 'New template' button was clicked, and a pop up titled 'New JWT template' is shown. The 'Supabase' template is hovered over."

Once the Supabase template is created, you will be redirected to the template's page. You can now configure the template to your needs.

  alt="The 'Create new template' page of the JWT Templates page in the Clerk Dashboard."

The Supabase template will pre-populate the default claims required by Supabase. You can include additional claims as necessary. [Shortcodes](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates#shortcodes) are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.

Supabase requires that JWTs be signed with the H256 signing algorithm and use their signing key. You can locate the JWT secret key in your Supabase project under **Settings --> API** in the *Config* section.

  alt="The 'Create new template' page of the JWT Templates page in the Clerk Dashboard. The page is scrolled down to the 'Claims' section."
/>

Reveal the JWT secret to copy it and then paste it in the **Signing key field** in the Clerk JWT template. ​​After the key is added, you can click the Apply Changes button to save your template.

## Configure your client

To configure your client, you need to set some local environment variables. Assuming a React application, set the following:

<InjectKeys>

```js filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

</InjectKeys>

You can find your Frontend API value in the Clerk Dashboard on the **[API keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)** page. It will be the **Publishable key**.

<Images

  src="/docs/images/integrations/publishable-key.webp"
  alt="The API keys page in the Clerk Dashboard. There is a red arrow pointing to the copy button next to the 'Publishable key'."
/>

To get the ones needed for Supabase, navigate to the same **Settings > API page** as before and locate the **anon public key** and **URL**.​

  alt="The 'API' page in the Supabase Dashboard. There is a red box surrounding the 'anon public key' and 'URL' fields."

  Note: Supabase recommends enabling [Row Level Security (RLS)](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security) for your database tables and configuring access policies as needed.
</Callout>

After setting those three environment variables, you should be able to start up your application development server.

Install the JavaScript client for Supabase with:

```sh filename="terminal"
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

You can then initialize the Supabase client by passing it the environment variables and the access token from Clerk.

```jsx
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-react';
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const supabaseClient = async (supabaseAccessToken) => {
    const supabase = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY, {
      global: { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${supabaseAccessToken}` } },
    });
    // set Supabase JWT on the client object,
    // so it is sent up with all Supabase requests
    return supabase;
  };
  
function App() {
  const { getToken } = useAuth();

  const fetchData = async () => {
    // TODO #1: Replace with your JWT template name
    const supabaseAccessToken = await getToken({ template: 'supabase' });

    const supabase = await supabaseClient(supabaseAccessToken);
    
    // TODO #2: Replace with your database table name
    
    const { data, error } = await supabase.from('your_table').select();

    // TODO #3: Handle the response
  };

  return (
    <div className="app">
      <button onClick={fetchData}>Fetch data</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Access user ID in RLS policies

It is common practice to need access to the user identifier on the database level, especially when working with RLS policies in Postgres. Although Supabase provides a special function `auth.uid()` to extract the user ID from the JWT, this [does not currently work](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/4954) with Clerk. The workaround is to write a custom SQL function to read the sub property from the JWT claims.

In the **SQL Editor** section of the Supabase dashboard, click New Query and enter the following:

```json
create or replace function requesting_user_id()
returns text 
language sql stable
as $$
  select nullif(current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'sub', '')::text;
$$;
```

This will create a `requesting_user_id()` function that can be used within an RLS policy.

For example, this policy would check that the user making the request is authenticated and matches the `user_id` column of a todos table.

```json
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update their own todos" 
	ON public.todos FOR UPDATE USING (
		auth.role() = 'authenticated'::text
	) WITH CHECK (
		requesting_user_id() = user_id
	);
```
