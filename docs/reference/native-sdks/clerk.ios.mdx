description: Use Clerk in your iOS app with shared access and SwiftUI integration.
sdk: ios

`Clerk` is the main entry point for the SDK. After you [configure the SDK](/docs/reference/native-sdks/configuration), you can access it in two ways:

## SwiftUI

After you inject `Clerk.shared` into the environment, you can access it with `@Environment(Clerk.self)`.

```swift
import ClerkKit
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
  @Environment(Clerk.self) private var clerk

  var body: some View {
    if clerk.activeUser != nil {
      Text("Signed in")
    } else {
      Text("Signed out")
    }
  }
}
```

## Access the shared instance

If you're not using SwiftUI, you can always access Clerk through the shared instance.

```swift
let clerk = Clerk.shared
```
