description: Grant access to your privileged content and data using features.

Features allow you to grant access to specific parts of your application, like your privileged content and data.

Features can be used with [organizations](/docs/guides/organizations/overview) to create custom permissions. Custom permissions are always tied to a feature, and are formatted as `org:<feature>:<permission>`. For example, you could create a feature called **invoices** and then create a new permission called **create invoices**. The custom permission's key would be `org:invoices:create`.

Features can also be used with [billing](/docs/guides/billing/overview) to create features specific to a subscription plan.

To manage your features, navigate to the [**Features**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/features) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
