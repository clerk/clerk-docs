      To access information about the currently [Active Organization](!active-organization) on the server-side, use [`clerkClient()`](/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart#instantiate-a-default-clerk-client-instance) to call the [`getOrganization()`](/docs/reference/backend/organization/get-organization) method, which returns the Backend [`Organization`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization) object. You'll need to pass an `orgId`, which you can access from the [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object.
