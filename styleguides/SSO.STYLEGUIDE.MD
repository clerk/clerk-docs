# Clerk SSO Styleguide

These are the guidelines we use to write our SSO guides.

## Structure of the guide

- The frontmatter should be formatted as follows:

  ```mdx
  ---
  title: Add <SSO_PROVIDER> as a <SSO_TYPE> connection
  description: Learn how to allow users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their <SSO_PROVIDER> account using <SSO_TYPE>.
  ---
  ```

- Needs a `<TutorialHero />` component
- The introductory sentence should be formatted as follows:

  ```mdx
  Enabling <TYPE_OF_SSO> with <SSO_PROVIDER> allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their <SSO_PROVIDER> account.
  ```

- **Social connection guides only** The instructions for **development** versus **production** should be formatted as follows:

  ```mdx
  ## Configure for your development instance

  For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

  ## Configure for your production instance

  For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

  To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [<SSO_PROVIDER>](SSO_PROVIDER_URL).
  ```

- Use `<Steps />` to lay out the steps
- For the "Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard" step, it can be formatted in one of two ways:

  1. With a partial. Use this method if the provider uses "Client ID" and "Client Secret" for their terminology.

     ```mdx
     ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

     <Include src="_partials/authentication/set-client-id-secret" />
     ```

  1. With a full step. Use this method if the provider uses a different terminology, such as "Key" instead of "Client ID". Note how the title of the section and the copy of the first step depends on the terminology.

     ```mdx
     ### Set the Key and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

     1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open. Paste the **Key** and **Client Secret** values that you saved into the respective fields.
     1. Select **Add connection**.

     > [!NOTE]
     > If the modal or page is no longer open, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, paste the values into their respective fields.
     ```

- The `Test your connection` section should be included in the `<Steps />` and formatted as follows:

  ```mdx
  ### Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/test-your-connection" />
  ```

## No screenshots: writing copy that references the UI

Screenshots should be used little to none in the docs. The instructions should be explicit and include all necessary details without the need for a visual reference. The instructions should be laid out as numbered lists to make the content more palatable to readers. Links should be added on their first reference.

### Do

```mdx
1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Microsoft**.
1. Select **Add connection**.
```

### Don't

In this example, the instructions are not explicit, as it tells the reader to select **Microsoft** but doesn't specify where to find it.

```mdx
1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection**.
1. Select **For all users**.
1. Select **Microsoft**.
```

## Bold proper nouns

Bold proper nouns found in the UI, such as titles, headings, product names, etc.

An exception to this rule is the Clerk Dashboard, which doesn't need to be bolded to enforce consistency across the docs.

### Do

```mdx
In the **Azure services** section, select **Microsoft Entra ID**.
```

### Don't

```mdx
In the Azure services section, select Microsoft Entra ID.
```

## Writing about redirects

If the step ends with a redirect, include the redirect instructions in the step.

### Do

1. Select **New application**. You'll be redirected to the <SSO_PROVIDER_DASHBOARD>.
1. Select **Create your own application**.

### Don't

1. Select **New application**.
1. In the **<SSO_PROVIDER_DASHBOARD>**, select **Create your own application**.

## Component naming

The proper names for the components are:

- Dashboard: refers to a control panel or central hub where users can interact with multiple tools or view data
- Panel: drawer
- Modal: popup
- Dropdown

## Use conjunctions

Use conjunctions in the copy to make the copy more colloquial.

### Do

"You'll"

### Don't

"You will"

## Avoid using "button"

### Do

```mdx
1. Select **New client secret**.
```

### Don't

```mdx
1. Select the **New client secret** button.
```

## Avoid using "click"

### Do

```mdx
1. Select **New client secret**.
```

### Don't

```mdx
1. Click **New client secret**.
```

## Avoid using "appears"

### Do

```mdx
In the panel that opens
```

### Don't

```mdx
In the panel that appears
```

## Action verbs

- Add: general use (e.g., Add your app information)
- Enter: general typing (e.g., Enter your email address)
- Paste: to copy and paste values (e.g., Paste the Client ID you copied from the Clerk Dashboard)
- Complete: to fill out forms

## Application vs. app

Use "application" for the first instance where it's used and then "app" for the rest of the guide.

## Redirected to vs. taken to

Use "redirected to" instead of "taken to."

## Ensure vs. make sure

Use "ensure" instead of "make sure."

### Do

```mdx
On this same page, under **Client credentials**, select **Add a certificate or secret** to generate a Client Secret. You'll be redirected to the **Certificate & secrets** page.
```

### Don't

```mdx
On this same page, under **Client credentials**, select **Add a certificate or secret** to generate a Client Secret. You'll be taken to the **Certificate & secrets** page.
```

## Page vs. Tab

Assume users are opening windows versus browser tabs. Use active voice (e.g., "keep" vs. "leave).

### Do

```mdx
Keep the page open.
```

### Don't

```mdx
Leave the page open.
```

```mdx
