# Environments / Instances

When creating a new application within Clerk, you are typically provided with two instances: `Development` and `Production`.  These instances vary slightly and should be used appropriately.

## Development Instance
A `Development` instance is our default instance type and has characteristics that allow it to be more useful for local development, and therefore has a more relaxed overall security posture.

Some notable examples of `Development`-only characteristics are: 
- A "Development" banner is shown prominently to make clear you're managing or configuring non-production data
- Email and SMS templates are prepended with the environment type to prevent against using Development instances for production purposes
- Some social connections use shared credentials by default 
- Certain functionality like Bot Protection is only available in Production mode
> **Note:** All paid functionality is available in a `Development` instance. It's only when you deploy your application to `Production` that you will be asked to upgrade to a `Pro` account. See [our pricing page](/pricing) for full details.


## Production Instance
A `Production` instance is the more robust of our instance types. It is meant to support high-volumes of production traffic and by default has a more strict security posture.

Some notable differences with a `Development` instance are: 
- You must associate a production domain within the Dashboard
- You are required to provision your own SSO credentials 


To take advantage, you must activate your `Production` environment. We've created a guide for [Deploying to Production](/docs/deployments/overview#deploying-to-production) to help you avoid any common pitfalls.
