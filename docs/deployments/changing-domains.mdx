# Change domain or subdomain

Learn how to change your production instance's domain or subdomain on Clerk.

## Change domain

Production domains can be changed in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) or via our [backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api). Once you make the change to your domain, you will need to update the following:

- Update DNS records
- Generate new SSL certificates
- [Update your publishable key](#updating-your-publishable-key)
- If using social connections, update the settings with your social connections, so the redirect URL they are using is correct.
- If using JWT templates, update JWT issuer and JWKS endpoint in external JWT SSO services.

### Updating your publishable key

After changing your domain, a new **Publishable key** will be automatically generated for your application. You will need to update your environment variables with this new key and redeploy your application. You can find your **Publishable key** on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of the Clerk Dashboard.

<Callout>
  Failing to update your **Publishable key** will result in Clerk failing to load.

### Update via Clerk Dashboard

To update the production URL from the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the **Danger** tab of the [Domains](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=domains) page and select **Change domain**.

### Update via backend API

To update the production URL using the backend API, you can copy the following cURL code. You will want to replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your Clerk secret key, which can be found on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of the Clerk Dashboard. Then, make sure to update the `home_url` field with your new production URL.

```bash
curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: <YOUR_SECRET_KEY>' -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{
"home_url": "YOUR_PROD_URL"
}' 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/instance/change_domain'
```

For more information on how to update your instance settings using the backend API, see our [backend API reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Beta-Features#operation/UpdateInstanceAuthConfig).

## Specify Subdomain

If you would like to specify your subdomain of your application, you can do this from the **Danger** tab of the [Domains](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=paths) page in the Clerk dashboard.
