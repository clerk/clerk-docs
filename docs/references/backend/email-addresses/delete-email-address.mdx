console.log(response);

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `DELETE/email_addresses/{email_address_id}`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Email-Addresses#operation/DeleteEmailAddress) for more details.
