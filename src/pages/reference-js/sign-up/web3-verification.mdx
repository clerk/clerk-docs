# Web3 Verificaiton

Test

## `prepareWeb3WalletVerification()`

```typescript
function prepareWeb3WalletVerification(): Promise<SignUp>;
```

Helper method that allows you to initiate a verification process for a web3 wallet public address. It sends the public address to the server and expects a nonce that will need to be signed.

This is equivalent to calling `SignUp.prepareVerification("web3_metamask_signature")`.

## `attemptWeb3WalletVerification()`

```typescript
function attemptWeb3WalletVerification(params: AttemptWeb3WalletVerificationParams): Promise<SignUp>;
```

Helper method that attempts to complete the verification process for a web3 wallet public address. It basically verifies that the supplied code is the same as the one-time code that was sent to the phone number during the prepare verification phase.

This is equivalent to calling `SignUp.attemptVerification({strategy: "web3_metamask_signature", signature: "..." })`.
