## Tutorial

<Steps>
  ### Set up an enterprise connection in Clerk

  To create a SAML connection in Clerk:

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
  1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
  1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For specific domains**.
  1. Add the **Name** of the connection. This is the name that will be displayed in the sign-in form.
  1. Add the **Specific Domain** that you want to allow this connection for. This is the domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your application.
  1. Select **Microsoft Entra ID (Formerly AD)** as the identity provider. You will be redirected to the connection's configuration page.

  ### Create a new enterprise application in Microsoft

  To create a new enterprise application in Microsoft:

  1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/azure-portal) and sign in.
  1. Under the **Azure Services** section, find and select **Enterprise Applications**. You may have to go to the [**All services**](https://portal.azure.com/#allservices) page and then scroll down to the **Identity** section to find it.
  1. Select the **New Application** button.
  1. Select the **Create your own application** button.
  1. Fill in the **Name**, ensure **Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)** is selected, and select the **Create** button.

  ### Assign selected user or group in Microsoft

  Now that you have created the enterprise application, you need to assign your users/user groups to it. For example, if you were part of the Clerk organization, you would have access to users and groups in the Clerk organization. In this case, you could assign one or more users or entire groups to the enterprise application you just created.

  1. Under the **Getting started** section, select **Assign users and groups**.
  1. Select the **Add user/group** button.
  1. Under **Users**, select the **None Selected** link.
  1. In the search field, enter the user or group of users that you want to assign to the enterprise application.
  1. Select the check box next to the user or group that you want to assign.
  1. Select the **Select** button at the bottom of the page.
  1. Select the **Assign** button at the bottom of the page.

  ### Configure single sign-on (SSO) in Microsoft

  After you have assigned the user or group of users to the enterprise application, you need to configure the single sign-on (SSO) settings to enable SAML SSO.

  1. In the navigation sidebar, select **Manage** and select **Single sign-on**.
  1. Select **SAML** as the single sign-on method.

  ### Configure your identity provider

  To configure your identity provider (Microsoft Entra ID), you need to add the following fields to your application:

  1. Find the **SAML Certificates** section.
  1. Copy the **App Federation Metadata Url**.
  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, in the modal you left open, under **Metadata**, paste the **App Federation Metadata Url** you copied in the previous step.
  1. Select **Add connection**. You will be redirected to the connection's configuration page.
  1. Scroll to the **Service Provider Configuration** section. Copy the **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** and **Identifier (Entity ID)** values and keep them in a secure location. You will need them in the next step.
  1. Leave this page open.

  ### Configure your service provider

  To configure your service provider (Clerk), you must add these two fields to your IdP's application:

  - **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** - This is your application's URL that your IdP will redirect your users back to after they have authenticated in your IdP.
  - **Identifier (Entity ID)** - This is a unique identifier for your SAML connection that your IdP application needs.

  To fill out the appropriate values for these fields:

  1. In the Microsoft portal, on the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, find the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.
  1. Select the **Edit** button. This will open a **Basic SAML Configuration** modal.
  1. Paste the **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** and **Identifier (Entity ID)** values in their respective fields.
  1. Select **Save** at the top of the modal.

  ### Map Microsoft claims to Clerk attributes

  Mapping the claims in your IdP to the attributes in Clerk ensures that the data from your IdP is correctly mapped to the data in Clerk.

  | Clerk attribute | Microsoft claim |
  | - | - |
  | `mail` | `user.userprincipalname` |
  | `firstName` | `user.givenname` |
  | `lastName` | `user.surname` |

  The only Microsoft claim that is necessary to map is the email address claim. This is the email address that your users will use to log in to your application.

  1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, find the **Attributes & Claims** section.
  1. Select the **Edit** button.
  1. Select the email address claim (`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress`) to edit the field.
  1. Next to **Source attribute**, select the dropdown and choose `user.userprincipalname`.
  1. Select **Save** at the top of the page.

  ### Enable the connection for Clerk

  To make the connection available for your users to authenticate with:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, you should still have the connection's configuration page open. If not, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page and next to the connection, select the settings cog icon.
  1. Toggle on **Enable connection** and select **Save**.
