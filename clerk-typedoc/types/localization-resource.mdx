A type containing all the possible localization keys the prebuilt Clerk components support.
Users aiming to customize a few strings can also peak at the `data-localization-key` attribute by inspecting
the DOM and updating the corresponding key.
Users aiming to completely localize the components by providing a complete translation can use
the default english resource object from [Clerk's open source repo](https://github.com/clerk/javascript)
as a starting point.
