# Clerk environment variables

You can use environment variables to configure how your Clerk app behaves, such as where users are redirected after signing out of their account, or whether or not Clerk's telemetry should be enabled.

This page is a reference for all available Clerk APIs.

## Sign-in and sign-up redirects

Components such as [`<ClerkProvider>`](), [`<UserButton>`](), and more, provide props such as `afterSignUpUrl` for you to specify where users will be redirected. You should use environment variables instead of these props whenever possible.

See the [Custom Redirects guide]() for more information.
