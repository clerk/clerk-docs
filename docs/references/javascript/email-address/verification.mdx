# `EmailAddress` verification

These are all methods on the [`EmailAddress`](/docs/references/javascript/email-address/email-address) class that allow you to verify a user's email address.

## `prepareVerification()`

```typescript
function prepareVerification(params: PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<EmailAddress>;
```
