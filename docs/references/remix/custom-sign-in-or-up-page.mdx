title: Build your own sign-in-or-up page for your Remix app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add a custom sign-in-or-up page to your Remix app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component to build a custom page **that allows users to sign in or sign up within a single flow**.

To set up separate sign-in and sign-up pages, follow this guide, and then follow the [custom sign-up page guide](/docs/references/remix/custom-sign-up-page).

> [!NOTE]
> Just getting started with Clerk and Remix? See the [quickstart tutorial](/docs/quickstarts/remix)!

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-in-or-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component on a dedicated page using the [Remix optional route](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/route#optional-segments).

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-in.$.tsx' }}
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/remix'

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignIn />
  }
  ```

  ## Configure your sign-in-or-up page

  <Tabs items={["SSR Mode", "SPA Mode"]}>
    <Tab>
      - Set the `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` environment variable to tell Clerk where the `<SignIn />` component is being hosted.
      - Set `CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users visit the `/sign-in` route directly.
      - Set `CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users select the 'Don't have an account? Sign up' link at the bottom of the component.

      Learn more about these environment variables and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/custom-redirects).

      ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
      CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
      CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
      CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      - Set the `signInUrl` property to your `ClerkApp` options to tell Clerk where the `<SignIn />` component is being hosted.
      - Set the `signInFallbackRedirectUrl` property to a fallback URL incase users visit the `/sign-in` route directly.
      - Set the `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl` property to a fallback URL incase users select the 'Don't have an account? Sign up' link at the bottom of the component.

      Learn more about these environment variables and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/custom-redirects).

      ```ts {{ filename: 'app/root.tsx', mark: [[3, 4]] }}
      export default ClerkApp(App, {
        publishableKey: PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
        signInUrl: '/sign-in',
        signInFallbackRedirectUrl: '/',
        signUpFallbackRedirectUrl: '/',
      })
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ## Visit your new page

  Run your project with the following terminal command from the root directory of your project:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-in](http://localhost:3000/sign-in).
