# `SignUp`

The `SignUp` object holds the state of the current sign-up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-up process. Once a sign-up is complete, a new user is created.

The following steps outline the sign-up process:

1. Initiate the sign-up process by collecting the user's authentication information and passing the appropriate parameters to the [`create()`](#create) method.
1. Prepare the [verification.](#verification)
1. Attempt to complete the verification.
1. If the verification is successful, set the newly created session as the active session by passing the `SignIn.createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object.

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `id`
  - `string | undefined`

  The unique identifier of the current sign-up.

  ---

  - `status`
  - `'missing_requirements' | 'complete' | 'abandoned' | null`

  - `missing_requirements:` There are required fields that are either missing or they are unverified.
  - `complete:` All the required fields have been supplied and verified, so the sign-up is complete and a new user and a session have been created.
  - `abandoned:` The sign-up has been inactive for a long period of time, thus it's considered as abandoned and need to start over.

  ---

  - `requiredFields`
  - `string[]`

  An array of all the required fields that need to be supplied and verified in order for this sign-up to be marked as complete and converted into a user.

  ---

  - `optionalFields`
  - `string[]`

  An array of all the fields that can be supplied to the sign-up, but their absence does not prevent the sign-up from being marked as complete.

  ---

  - `missingFields`
  - `string[]`

  An array of all the fields whose values are not supplied yet but they are mandatory in order for a sign-up to be marked as complete.

  ---

  - `unverifiedFields`

  An object that contains information about all the verifications that are in-flight.

  ---

  - `username`

## Methods

### `create()`

Returns a new `SignUp` object based on the `params` you pass to it, stores the sign-up lifecycle state in the `status` property, and deactivates any existing sign-up process the client may already have in progress. Use this method to initiate a new sign-up process.

What you must pass to `params` depends on which [sign-up options](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options) you have enabled in your Clerk application instance.

Optionally, you can complete the sign-up process in one step if you supply the required fields to `create()`. Otherwise, Clerk's sign-up process provides great flexibility and allows users to easily create multi-step sign-up flows.

> [!WARNING]
> Once the sign-up process is complete, pass the `createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object. This will set the newly created session as the active session.

```typescript
function create(params: SignUpCreateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### `SignUpCreateParams`

<Properties>
  - `firstName`
  - `string | null`

  The user's first name. This option is available only if name is selected in personal information. Please check the instance settings for more information.

  ---

  - `lastName`
  - `string | null`

  The user's last name. This option is available only if name is selected in personal information. Please check the instance settings for more information.

  ---

  - `password`
  - `string | null`

  The user's password. This option is available only if password-based authentication is selected. Please check the instance settings for more information.

  ---

  - `gender`
  - `string | null`

  The user's gender. This option is available only if gender is selected in personal information. Please check the instance settings for more information.

  ---

  - `emailAddress`
  - `string | null`

  The user's email address. This option is available only if email address is selected in contact information. Keep in mind that the email address requires an extra verification process. Please check the instance settings for more information.

  ---

  - `phoneNumber`
  - `string | null`

  The user's phone number. This option is available only if phone number is selected in contact information. Keep in mind that the phone number requires an extra verification process. Please check the instance settings for more information.

  ---

  - `web3Wallet`
  - `string | null`

  The user's Web3 wallet public address. In [Ethereum](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/common-terms.html#address-public-key), the address is made up of `0x` + `40 hexadecimal characters`.

  ---

  - `username`
  - `string | null`

  The user's username. This option is available only if usernames are enabled. Please check the instance settings for more information.

  ---

  - `unsafeMetadata`
  - `{[string]: any} | null`

  Metadata that can be read and set from the frontend. Once the sign-up is complete, the value of this field will be automatically copied to the newly created user's unsafe metadata. One common use case for this attribute is to use it to implement custom fields that can be collected during sign-up and will automatically be attached to the created `User` object.

  ---

  - `strategy`
  - `'oauth_<provider>' | 'saml' | 'ticket'`

  The strategy to use for the sign-up flow. The following strategies are supported:

  - `oauth_<provider>`: The user will be authenticated with their social sign-in account. See available [OAuth providers](/docs/references/javascript/types/oauth#o-auth-provider).
  - `saml`: The user will be authenticated with SAML.
  - `ticket`: The user will be authenticated via the ticket _or token_ generated from the Backend API.
  - `google_one_tap`: The user will be authenticated with the Google One Tap UI. It's recommended to use [`authenticateWithGoogleOneTap()`](/docs/components/authentication/google-one-tap#authenticate-with-google-one-tap) instead, as it will also set the user's current session as active for you.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl` (deprecated)
  - `string`

  The redirect URL after the sign-up flow has completed. **`signInFallbackRedirectUrl` has priority over the deprecated `redirectUrl`. Use `fallbackRedirectUrl` or `forceRedirectUrl` instead of `redirectUrl`.**

  ---

  - `actionCompleteRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The URL that the user will be redirected to, after successful authorization from the OAuth provider and Clerk sign in. This parameter is required only if `strategy` is set to an OAuth strategy like `oauth_<provider>`, or set to `saml`.

</Properties>

### `update()`

This method is used to update the current sign-up.

As with `create`, the form of the given `params` depends on the configuration of the instance.

```typescript
function update(params: SignUpUpdateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### `SignUpUpdateParams`

`SignUpUpdateParams` is a mirror of [`SignUpCreateParams`](#sign-up-create-params) with the same fields and types.

### `createEmailLinkFlow()`

```typescript
function createEmailLinkFlow(): {
  startEmailLinkFlow: (params: StartEmailLinkFlowParams) => Promise<SignUp>
  cancelEmailLinkFlow: () => void
}
```

Sets up a sign-up with email link flow. Calling `createEmailLinkFlow()` will return two functions.

The first function is async and starts the email link flow, preparing an email link verification. It sends the email link email and starts polling for verification results. The signature is `startEmailLinkFlow({ redirectUrl: string }) => Promise<SignUpResource>`.

The second function can be used to stop polling at any time, allowing for full control of the flow and cleanup. The signature is `cancelEmailLinkFlow() => void`.

```typescript
function createEmailLinkFlow(): {
  startEmailLinkFlow: (params: StartEmailLinkFlowParams) => Promise<SignUpResource>
  cancelEmailLinkFlow: () => void
}
```

#### `createEmailLinkFlow()` returns

`createEmailLinkFlow` returns an object with two functions:

<Properties>
  - `startEmailLinkFlow`
  - <code>(params: [StartEmailLinkFlowParams](#start-email-link-flow-params)) => Promise\<SignUp></code>

  Function to start the email link flow. It prepares an email link verification and polls for the verification result.
</Properties>

#### `StartEmailLinkFlowParams`

<Properties>
  - `redirectUrl`
  - `string`

  The email link target URL. Users will be redirected here once they click the email link from their email.
</Properties>
