# `Layout` prop

The `layout` property can be used to change the layout of the [`<SignIn/>`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) and [`<SignUp/>`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) components, as well as set important links to your support, terms, and privacy pages.

| `helpPageUrl` | `string` | The URL to your help page. |
| `logoImageUrl` | `string` | The URL to your logo image. By default, the components will use the logo you've set in the Clerk Dashboard. This option is helpful when you need to display different logos for different themes, for example: white logo on dark themes, black logo on light themes. |
| `logoLinkUrl` | `string` | Controls where the browser will redirect to after the user clicks the application logo. If a URL is provided, it will be used as the `href` of the link.

| `socialButtonsPlacement` | `'bottom' \| 'top'` | The placement of your social buttons. Defaults to `'top'`. |
| `socialButtonsVariant` | `'blockButton' \| 'iconButton' \| 'auto'` | The variant of your social buttons. By default, the components will use `blockButton` if you have less than 3 social providers enabled, otherwise `iconButton` will be used. |
