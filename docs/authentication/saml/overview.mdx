description: Clerk supports Enterprise SSO via different protocols so that you can create authentication strategies for Identity Providers, such as Okta.
---

Clerk supports Enterprise SSO via the SAML protocol and [EASIE](https://easie.dev), enabling you to create authentication strategies for an Identity Provider (IdP). With Enterprise SSO, users can sign in seamlessly using their IdP's credentials and have their user data synchronized with Clerk. You can learn more about the process in the [Enterprise SSO authentication flows](/docs/authentication/saml/authentication-flows) and [Account linking](/docs/authentication/saml/account-linking) guides, or you can jump straight into integrating an IdP with Clerk.

Currently, Clerk offers direct SAML integrations with [Microsoft Azure AD](/docs/authentication/saml/azure), [Google Workspace](/docs/authentication/saml/google), and [Okta Workforce](/docs/authentication/saml/okta) as IdPs. However, you can also [integrate with any other IdP](/docs/authentication/saml/custom-provider) that supports the SAML protocol.

For EASIE connections, Clerk offers integration with Google Workspace and Microsoft Entra ID. Setting up an EASIE connection for production requires custom OAuth credentials, following the same steps outlined in our Google and Microsoft social connection guides:

- [Google](docs/authentication/social-connections/google)
- [Microsoft](docs/authentication/social-connections/azure)

For development, the same shared OAuth credentials supported by Social Connections can be used for EASIE.

## SAML vs. EASIE

[EASIE](https://easie.dev) Connections allow for enterprise-grade SSO through a multi-tenant OpenID provider. It is designed to support an easier alternative to fully fledged SAML SSO, without requiring additional configuration in the identity provider and potential sharing of credentials or secrets.

One of the primary tradeoffs is [security](https://easie.dev#security). Clerk does take steps to [migitate potential security conerns](https://easie.clerkstage.dev/#mitigating-tenant-crossover-vulnerabilities), but applications that must use single-tenant identity providers should use SAML SSO.

## Creating Enterprise Connections in Clerk Dashboard

To create an Enterprise Connection,

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
1. Click on **Add connection** on the top right and select **For specific domains**.
1. Select one of the IdP options for an EASIE or SAML connection.
1. On the next page, enter any required information for the new Enterprise Connection, such as the **domain**.

## Allow subdomains

Authenticating via SAML SSO requires the user's email address domain to match the exact domain the SAML connection has been configured with. By default, subdomains are not supported. For example, a user with the email address `john@sales.example.com` would not be able to use a SAML connection with the `example.com` domain in order to authenticate.

To support Enterprise SSO with subdomains,

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
1. Select the Enterprise Connection you want to allow subdomains for.
1. Select the **Advanced** tab.
1. Toggle on the **Allow subdomains** option.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable the **Allow subdomains** option, your Enterprise Connection domain must be an eTLD+1.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### I've enabled other strategies but they don't work

A Clerk application can have multiple authentication strategies, but a domain that enables Enterprise SSO can not. Once Enterprise SSO is enabled for a domain, there can be no other authentication methods for that specific domain. This is in line with an organization's intent to manage their users' identity from one place. This will allow your Clerk application to enable Enterprise SSO connections for certain domains while others use non-Enterprise SSO methods depending on each organization's needs.

### Will Enterprise SSO work for my existing users?

Yes, Enterprise SSO will work for your existing users as well! If you enable SAML or EASIE, any existing users with an email address that matches the SAML or EASIE Connection domain will have to authenticate on the IdP side and an Enterprise Account will be linked to their existing account.

### What happens if I have multi-factor enabled at Clerk?

This will work: Once the user comes back from the IdP, they will need to go through the extra factors of authentication. This is in case you need to add extra factors on top of what your IdP supports (or in case they don't). You can choose to not enable this feature if you wish.

### What happens if I delete the Enterprise Connection? Will my users be deleted?

The users will not be deleted, so your application will not break. However, they will need to use another [strategy](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#authentication-strategies) such as password, email OTP, etc., to authenticate themselves moving forward.

### Does Clerk support IdP-initiated SSO?

Yes, for SAML only. Clerk supports both Service Provider-initiated (SP-initiated) and Identity Provider-initiated (IdP-initiated) SSO flows. [Learn more](/docs/authentication/saml/authentication-flows).

### How much does it cost?

For production instances, each active SAML connection costs $50 per month. SAML connections require the Pro plan and the Enhanced Authentication Add-on. Please see [pricing](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} for those costs, and the costs of other add-ons or features.

EASIE connections are included with the Enahnced Authentication Add-on.

For development instances, Enterprise Connections will always be free, but capped to 5.

### Can I get a bulk discount?

Yes, [reach out to support](/contact/support){{ target: '_blank' }} to work out a custom plan.
