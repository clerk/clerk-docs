title: Upgrade to @clerk/nextjs v6
description: Learn how to upgrade your application to use the latest Clerk Next.js SDK with support for Next.js 15.
---

To upgrade to `@clerk/nextjs` v6, use the upgrade CLI:

```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
npx @clerk/upgrade
```

The CLI will walk you through the upgrade and apply necessary changes to your application automatically.

## `auth()` is now async

To support Next.js's change to async dynamic APIs, `auth()` is now asynchronous. The codemod will migrate this for you.

```diff
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

- export function GET() {
-  const { userId } = auth();
+ export async function GET() {
+  const { userId } = await auth();

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ userId }));
}
```

### In `clerkMiddleware`

Now that `auth()` is asynchronous, custom middleware handlers that rely on `auth()` must also now be converted to be asynchronous. The codemod will migrate this for you.

```diff
import { clerkClient, clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

- export default clerkMiddleware((auth, request) => {
-  const resolvedAuth = auth();
+ export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, request) => {
+  const resolvedAuth = await auth();

  const count = await resolvedAuth.users.getCount();

  if (count) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/new-url', request.url));
  }
});

export const config = {
  matcher: [...],
};
```

## `clerkClient()` is now async

Previously the `clerkClient()` method from `@clerk/nextjs/server` was synchronous, it is now asynchronous.

```diff
import { clerkClient, clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

- export default clerkMiddleware((auth, request) => {
-  const client = clerkClient();
+ export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, request) => {
+  const client = await clerkClient();

  const count = await client.users?.getCount();

  if (count) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/new-url', request.url));
  }
});

export const config = {
  matcher: [...],
};
```

## `auth().protect()` is now `auth.protect()`

To ease calling of `protect()`, it is now accessible on the `auth` export, instead of from the return value.

```diff
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

- export default function Page() {
-   auth().protect()
+ export default async function Page() {
+   await auth.protect()
}
```

## Static rendering by default

Starting with v6, `<ClerkProvider>` will no longer opt your entire application into dynamic rendering by default. If this behavior is still desired, pass the `dynamic` prop to your root `<ClerkProvider>`:

```diff
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
-   <ClerkProvider>
+   <ClerkProvider dynamic>
      <html>
        <body>{children}</body>
      </html>  
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}
```

Note that this isn't recommended, and in most cases you should use `auth()` to access auth data at request time instead. For more information, see the guide on [Next.js rendering modes and Clerk](/docs/references/nextjs/rendering-modes).

## Removed deprecated APIs

The following deprecated APIs have been removed.

- `authMiddleware()` - [Migrate to `clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/upgrade-guides/core-2/nextjs#migrating-to-clerk-middleware)
- `redirectToSignIn()` - Migrate to `const { redirectToSignIn } = await auth()`
- `redirectToSignUp()` - Migrate to `const { redirectToSignUp } = await auth()`
- `clerkClient` - Migrate to `await clerkClient()`
