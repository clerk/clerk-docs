The `Web3Wallet` object describes a Web3 wallet address. The address can be used as a proof of identification for users.

Web3 addresses must be verified to ensure that they can be assigned to their rightful owners. The verification is completed via Web3 wallet browser extensions, such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), and [OKX Wallet](https://www.okx.com/help/section/faq-web3-wallet). The `Web3Wallet` object holds all the necessary state around the verification process.

The verification process always starts with the [`Web3Wallet.prepareVerification()`](/docs/references/javascript/types/web3-wallet#prepare-verification) or [`signIn.prepareFirstFactor()`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in#prepare-first-factor) method, which will send the wallet address to Clerk's [Frontend API](/docs/reference/frontend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} and will receive a nonce that needs to be signed by the Web3 wallet browser extension. A signature is generated from the nonce and is returned in the `Verification.message` property of the returned `Web3Wallet` object.

The second and final step involves an attempt to complete the verification by calling [`Web3Wallet.attemptVerification()`](/docs/references/javascript/types/web3-wallet#attempt-verification) method, passing the signature that was generated from the `prepareVerification()`method as a parameter.

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `id`
  - `string`

  The unique ID for the Web3 wallet.

  ---

  - `web3Wallet`
  - `string`

  The Web3 wallet address, made up of 0x + 40 hexadecimal characters.

  ---

  - `verification`
  - [`Verification`](/docs/references/javascript/types/verification)

  An object holding information on the verification of this Web3 wallet.
</Properties>

## Methods

### `create()`

Creates a new Web3 wallet.

```typescript
function create(): Promise<Web3Wallet>
```

### `destroy()`

Deletes this Web3 wallet.

```typescript
function destroy(): Promise<void>
```

### `toString()`

Returns the `web3Wallet` hexadecimal string.

```typescript
function toString(): string
```

## `prepareVerification()`

Starts the verification process for the Web3 wallet. The user will be prompted to sign a generated nonce by the browser extension. Returns a `Web3Wallet` object **with the signature in the `Verification.message` property.** The signature should then be passed to the [`attemptVerification()`](#attempt-verification) method.

```typescript
function prepareVerification(params: PrepareWeb3WalletVerificationParams): Promise<Web3Wallet>
```

### `PrepareWeb3WalletVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'web3_metamask_signature'` | `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'` | `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`

  The verification strategy to validate the user's sign-up request. The following strategies are supported:

  - `'web3_metamask_signature'`: User will need to sign a message and generate a signature using MetaMask browser extension.
  - `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'`: User will need to sign a message and generate a signature using Coinbase Wallet.
  - `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`: User will need to sign a message and generate a signature using OKX Wallet.
</Properties>

## `attemptVerification()`

Attempts to verify the Web3 wallet by passing the signature generated from the [`prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification) method. Returns a `Web3Wallet` object.

```typescript
function attemptVerification(params: AttemptWeb3WalletVerificationParams): Promise<Web3Wallet>
```

### `AttemptWeb3WalletVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `signature`
  - `string`

  The signature generated from calling the [`prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification) method.
</Properties>
