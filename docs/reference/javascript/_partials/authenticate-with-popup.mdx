Opens a popup window to allow a user to sign up via a Single Sign On (SSO) connection, such as OAuth or SAML, where an external account is used for verifying the user's identity.

```typescript
function authenticateWithPopup(params: AuthenticateWithPopupParams): Promise<void>
```

#### `AuthenticateWithPopupParams`

<Properties>
  - `redirectUrl`
  - `string`

  The full URL or path that the OAuth provider should redirect to after successful authorization on their part. Typically, this will be a simple `/sso-callback` route that either calls [`Clerk.handleRedirectCallback`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#handle-redirect-callback) or mounts the [`<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />`](/docs/reference/components/control/authenticate-with-redirect-callback) component. See the [custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/oauth-connections) for implementation details.

  ---

  - `redirectUrlComplete`
  - `string`

  The full URL or path to navigate to after the OAuth or SAML flow completes.

  ---

  - `strategy`
  - `'oauth_<provider>' | 'saml' | 'enterprise_sso'`

  The strategy to use for authentication. The following strategies are supported:

  - `'oauth_<provider>'`: The user will be authenticated with their [social connection account](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/all-providers). See a list of [supported values for `<provider>`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sso).
  - `'saml'` (deprecated): **Deprecated in favor of `'enterprise_sso'`.** The user will be authenticated with their [SAML account](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/overview#saml).
  - `'enterprise_sso'`: The user will be authenticated either through SAML or OIDC depending on the configuration of their [enterprise SSO account](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/overview).

  ---

  - `popup`
  - `Window`

  A reference to a popup window opened via `window.open()`.

  ---

  - `continueSignUp?`
  - `boolean | undefined`

  Whether to continue (i.e. PATCH) an existing `SignUp` (if present) or create a new `SignUp`.

  ---

  - `emailAddress?`
  - `string | undefined`

  Email address to use for targeting an enterprise connection at sign-up.

  ---

  - `identifier?`
  - `string | undefined`

  Identifier to use for targeting an enterprise connection at sign-up.

  ---

  - `legalAccepted?`
  - `boolean`

  A boolean indicating whether the user has agreed to the [legal compliance](/docs/guides/secure/legal-compliance) documents.

  ---

  - `unsafeMetadata?`
  - [`SignUpUnsafeMetadata`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/metadata#sign-up-unsafe-metadata)

  Metadata that can be read and set from the frontend. Once the sign-up is complete, the value of this field will be automatically copied to the newly created user's unsafe metadata. One common use case for this attribute is to use it to implement custom fields that can be collected during sign-up and will automatically be attached to the created `User` object.
</Properties>

#### Example

```js
await clerk.signUp.authenticateWithPopup({
  popup: window.open('https://example.com', '_blank'),
  strategy: 'oauth_google',
  redirectUrl: '/sso-callback',
  redirectUrlComplete: '/home',
})
```
