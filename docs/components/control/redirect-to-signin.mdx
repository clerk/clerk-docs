# `<RedirectToSignIn />`

The `<RedirectToSignIn />` component will navigate to the sign in URL which has been configured in your application instance. The behavior will be just like a server-side (3xx) redirect, and will override the current location in the history stack.

    SignedOut,
    RedirectToSignIn,
  } from "@clerk/nextjs";
