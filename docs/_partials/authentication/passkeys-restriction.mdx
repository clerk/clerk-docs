Passkeys are tied to the domain they are created on and **cannot be used across different domains**. However, passkeys **do work on subdomains if they are registered on the root domain**, so all passkeys registered on `domain.com` would work for any subdomains. For example:

- Passkeys created on `your-domain.com` **cannot be used** on `your-domain-admin.com` (different domains).
- Passkeys created on `your-domain.com` **can be used** on `accounts.your-domain.com` (subdomain of the same root domain).
- Passkeys created on `staging1.your-domain.com` **cannot be used** on `staging2.your-domain.com` as long as `your-domain.com` is the primary domain for the app (sibling subdomains).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This means that **[satellite domains](/docs/advanced-usage/satellite-domains) do not support passkeys** because they are considered different domains. If you plan to use satellite domains - in either development or production - you should avoid using passkeys, as they won't be portable between your primary domain and your satellite domains.

If you're **not** using satellite domains:

- **In development**, you can either:

  - Use Clerk's [Components](/docs/components/overview), [Elements](/docs/customization/elements/overview), or [custom flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview), instead of the Account Portal. This ensures the passkey is created and used entirely on your development domain, so passkeys created on `localhost` will only work on `localhost`. **This is the recommended approach**
  - Create a passkey directly through the Account Portal instead of your local application to keep it tied to the portal's domain. Passkeys created on your Account Portal (e.g., `your-app.accounts.dev`) will only work on that domain, which can cause issues if you switch between `localhost` and the Account Portal during developemnt. If you choose this approach, ensure all testing happens on the same domain where the passkey was created.

- **In production,** this limitation typically **does not apply** because your Account Portal is usually hosted on a subdomain of your main domain (e.g. `accounts.your-domain.com`), enabling passkeys to work seamlessly across your app. However, as stated above, if you use **satellite domains**, this issue **does apply** and it is not recommended to use passkeys in that scenario.
