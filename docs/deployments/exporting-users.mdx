## Exporting your user's data from Clerk

### Programattic access to user data
Some applications may require the ability to fetch a list of all of their user's and their data. By using the [GetUserList](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/GetUserList) endpoint of Clerk's Backend API, you can programattically export your user's data safely. 

Additionally, the [`getUserList()`](/docs/references/backend/user/get-user-list) method in the [Clerk Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) can also be used to retrieve a list of users.

## Migrating your users to a new system
However if you wish to get your user's data that includes their hashed passwords, please reach out to [support](https://clerk.com/support) where we can assist you in a secure data exchange.
