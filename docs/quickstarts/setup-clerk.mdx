Creating a Clerk account and using it in your apps is a simple three-step process:

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Create a Clerk account

  [Go to Clerk's sign-up page](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up) and create an account.

  {/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}

  <div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)", maxWidth: "400px"}}>![An interactive "Create your account" card which provides sign-up options for a GitHub or Google account as well as email and password.](/docs/images/get-started/create-clerk-account.png)</div>

  ### Step 2: Create a Clerk application

  Once you've created an account, you'll be redirected to [your Clerk dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).

  On a freshly created account, you won't have any applications. To create one, press the "Add application" card:

  {/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}

  <div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)", maxWidth: "400px"}}>![An "Add application" card on your dashboard](/docs/images/get-started/add-application.png)</div>

  When the "Add application" card is pressed, you'll be directed to create your `<SignIn>` component and select your preferred
  auth providers.

  {/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}

  <div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)"}}>![An interactive builder to make your "SignIn" component truly yours, which lets you select your auth providers.](/docs/images/get-started/create-sign-in-comp.png)</div>

  > [Clerk provides over 20 authentication providers that you can utilize in your Clerk apps.](/users/authentication-providers/overview)

  Once done, you should see a list of API keys that make setting up a new codebase easier.

  {/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}

  <div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)"}}>![A list of supported frameworks with instructions on how to add API keys underneath.](/docs/images/get-started/env-keys.png)</div>

  ### Step 3: Spin up a new codebase

  The API keys listed in the dashboard are just the first step to integrating Clerk into your apps. To get the most out
