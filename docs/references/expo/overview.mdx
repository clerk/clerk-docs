# Expo and Clerk

> [!WARNING]
> Currently the `@clerk/expo` SDK only supports mobile app output. Expo web is not supported. You can upvote the addition of Clerk supporting web output [here](https://feedback.clerk.com/roadmap/fb56a8db-763a-4e0d-a4b2-f8a453be195c).

Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your Expo application. This documentation covers the capabilities and methods available from Clerk's Expo SDK.

See [the quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/expo) to get started.

## Custom flow examples

Clerk's prebuilt components are not supported in native applications. You must use Clerk's API to build custom UI's for flows such as signing in and signing up. See the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview) guides for more information.

## Deploy your Expo app

To learn how to deploy your Expo application, see the [dedicated guide](https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/deploy-expo).
