title: Build your own UI (custom flows)
description: Learn the process behind building custom sign-up and sign-in flows with Clerk.

A **custom flow** refers to a user interface built entirely from scratch using the Clerk API.

Custom flows are considered **advanced** and are generally not recommended for most use cases. They require more development effort and are not as easy to maintain as the prebuilt components. However, if [prebuilt components](/docs/reference/components/overview) don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API.

**If you choose this approach, the Clerk support team will do their best to assist you, but they cannot guarantee a resolution due to the highly customized nature of custom flows.**

The custom flow guide that you need will depend on the settings you've configured in the Clerk Dashboard. For example, if you've enabled email and password, then you'd choose the [custom flow for email and password](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-password). It's likely you'll need to combine many of the guides to build out your application.
