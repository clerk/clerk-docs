Passkeys are tied to the domain they are created on and **cannot be used across different domains**. However, passkeys **do work on subdomains** if they are registered on the root domain. For example:

- Passkeys created on `your-domain.com` **cannot be used** on `your-domain-admin.com` (different domains).
- Passkeys created on `your-domain.com` **can be used** on `accounts.your-domain.com` (subdomain of the same root domain).
- Passkeys created on `staging1.your-domain.com` **cannot be used** on `staging2.your-domain.com` (sibling subdomains) unless the passkey was scoped to `your-domain.com` (i.e. the shared root domain).

**If you're using [satellite domains](/docs/guides/dashboard/dns-domains/satellite-domains)**, in both development and production, passkeys won't be portable between your primary domain and your satellite domains so you should avoid using them.

If you're **not** using satellite domains:

- **In development**, you can either:
  - **The recommended approach**. Use Clerk's [components](/docs/reference/components/overview), [Elements](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/elements/overview), or [custom flows](!custom-flow), instead of the [Account Portal](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/account-portal). This ensures the passkey is created and used entirely on your development domain, so passkeys created on `localhost` will only work on `localhost`.
  - Create a passkey directly through the Account Portal instead of your local application to keep it tied to the Account Portal's domain. Passkeys created on your Account Portal (e.g., `your-app.accounts.dev`) will only work on that domain, which can cause issues if you switch between `localhost` and the Account Portal during development. If you choose this approach, ensure all testing happens on the same domain where the passkey was created.

- **In production,** your Account Portal is usually hosted on a subdomain of your main domain (e.g. `accounts.your-domain.com`), enabling passkeys to work seamlessly across your app. However, as stated above, if you use **satellite domains**, passkeys will not work as intended.
