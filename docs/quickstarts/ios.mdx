</TutorialHero>

<Steps>
  ### Create an iOS Project

  To get started using Clerk with iOS, create a new project in Xcode. Select SwiftUI as your interface and Swift as your language.
  See the [Xcode documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-an-xcode-project-for-an-app) for more information.

  ### Install the Clerk iOS SDK

  Follow the Swift Package Manager [instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app) to install Clerk as a dependency.
  When prompted for the package url, enter [https://github.com/clerk/clerk-ios](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-ios). Be sure to add the package to your target.

  ### Load Clerk

  Inside your new project in Xcode, open your `@main` app file.

  - Import the ClerkSDK.
  - Attach a task modifier to `ContentView`. In the body of the task, add the following lines to configure `Clerk` with your publishable key and then load `Clerk`.

  <InjectKeys>
    ```swift {{ filename: 'ClerkQuickstartApp.swift' }}
    import SwiftUI
    import ClerkSDK

    @main
    struct ClerkQuickstartApp: App {
        var body: some Scene {
            WindowGroup {
                ContentView()
                    .task {
                        Clerk.shared.configure(publishableKey: {{pub_key}})
                        try? await Clerk.shared.load()
                    }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
  </InjectKeys>

  ### Conditionally Render Content

  Open your `ContentView.swift` file.

  - Import the ClerkSDK.
  - Add a new variable `clerk` marked with the `@ObservedObject` property wrapper.
  - Replace the content of the view body with the below.

  ```swift {{ filename: 'ContentView.swift' }}
  import SwiftUI
  import ClerkSDK

  struct ContentView: View {
      @ObservedObject private var clerk = Clerk.shared

      var body: some View {
          VStack {
              if let user = clerk.user {
                  Text("Hello, \(user.id)")
              } else {
                  Text("You are signed out.")
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```
</Steps>
