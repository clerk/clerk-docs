Clerk provides support for building AI-powered applications with secure authentication. Whether you're building an MCP server that allows AI agents to access user data, or using AI-powered development tools to build applications with Clerk, these guides cover everything you need to get started.

## AI prompts

Clerk's AI prompt library provides curated prompts to help you work more efficiently with AI-powered development tools like Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and more. These prompts guide AI assistants in helping you implement Clerk's features correctly.

To learn more, see the [AI prompts](/docs/guides/ai/prompts) guide.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is an open standard that lets large language model (LLM), like Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, VS Code, Zeb, and other clients securely access user data from external services with the user's permission. Clerk's OAuth server, dynamic client registration, and SDK support make it an ideal authorization server for MCP implementations.

To learn more about connecting MCP clients and building MCP servers with Clerk, see the following guides:
