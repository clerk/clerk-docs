Use `Auth` for sign-in and sign-up flows, and to manage sessions. You can access auth with `clerk.auth`.

## Sign in


### Sign in with password

Sign in directly with an identifier (email, phone, or username) and password:

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signInWithPassword(
  identifier: "user@email.com",
  password: "secretpassword"
)
```

### Sign in with OTP (email)

Send an [OTP](!otp) to the supplied email, and then verify the code.

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signInWithEmailCode(emailAddress: "user@email.com")
signIn = try await signIn.verifyCode("123456")
```

### Sign in with OTP (phone)

Send an [OTP](!otp) to the supplied phone number, and then verify the code.

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signInWithPhoneCode(phoneNumber: "+1234567890")
signIn = try await signIn.verifyCode("123456")
```

### Sign in with OAuth

Sign in using an OAuth provider (e.g., Google, GitHub):

```swift
var result = try await clerk.auth.signInWithOAuth(provider: .google)
```

### Sign in with Apple

Sign in using Sign in with Apple:

```swift
var result = try await clerk.auth.signInWithApple()
```

See the [Sign in with Apple guide](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-in-with-apple) for native iOS setup.

### Sign in with ID token

Sign in with an ID token from a provider:

```swift
var result = try await clerk.auth.signInWithIdToken(
  idToken,
  provider: .apple
)
```

### Sign in with passkey

Sign in using a passkey:

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signInWithPasskey()
```

### Sign in with Enterprise SSO

Sign in using [Enterprise SSO](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/overview):

```swift
var result = try await clerk.auth.signInWithEnterpriseSSO(emailAddress: "user@company.com")
```

### Sign in with ticket

Sign in using a ticket generated from the Backend API:

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signInWithTicket(ticket)
```

### Sign in with identifier

Start a sign-in with an identifier (email, phone, or username):

```swift
// Email
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signIn("user@email.com")
```

```swift
// Phone
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signIn("+1234567890")
```

```swift
// Username
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signIn("johndoe")
```

### Continue an existing sign-in

Use these methods when you already have a `SignIn` from `clerk.auth.signIn(...)` or `clerk.auth.currentSignIn`, and want to complete it with a specific factor or provider.

#### Send and verify email code

Send the user an [OTP](!otp) via email to verify their sign-in. Then verify the code that the user supplies:

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.sendEmailCode()
signIn = try await signIn.verifyCode("123456")
```

#### Send and verify phone code

Send the user an [OTP](!otp) via SMS to verify their sign-in. Then verify the code that the user supplies:

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.sendPhoneCode()
signIn = try await signIn.verifyCode("123456")
```

#### Authenticate with password

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.authenticateWithPassword("secretpassword")
```

#### Authenticate with OAuth

Authenticate with an OAuth provider (e.g., Google, GitHub, see [all providers](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/overview#supported-social-providers)):

```swift
var result = try await signIn.authenticateWithOAuth(provider: .google)
```

#### Authenticate with Enterprise SSO

```swift
var result = try await signIn.authenticateWithEnterpriseSSO()
```

#### Authenticate with Apple

```swift
var result = try await signIn.authenticateWithApple()
```

See the [Sign in with Apple guide](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-in-with-apple) for native iOS setup.

#### Authenticate with ID token

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.authenticateWithIdToken(
  idToken,
  provider: .apple
)
```

#### Authenticate with passkey

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.authenticateWithPasskey()
```

### Multi-factor authentication

After completing first factor verification, if multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required, use these methods to complete the second factor verification. The examples assume you already have a `SignIn` from a sign-in flow.

#### MFA with phone code

Send and verify an MFA code via SMS:

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.sendMfaPhoneCode()
signIn = try await signIn.verifyMfaCode(
  "123456",
  type: .phoneCode
)
```

#### MFA with email code

Send and verify an MFA code via email:

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.sendMfaEmailCode()
signIn = try await signIn.verifyMfaCode(
  "123456",
  type: .emailCode
)
```

#### MFA with TOTP (authenticator app)

Verify using a TOTP code from an authenticator app:

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.verifyMfaCode(
  "123456",
  type: .totp
)
```

### MFA with backup code

Verify using a backup code:

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.verifyMfaCode(
  "backup123",
  type: .backupCode
)
```

### Password reset

The Clerk iOS SDK provides methods to reset user passwords via email or phone verification.

#### Password reset with email

Reset password using email verification:

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signIn("user@email.com")
signIn = try await signIn.sendResetPasswordEmailCode()
signIn = try await signIn.verifyCode("123456")
signIn = try await signIn.resetPassword(
  newPassword: "newpassword",
  signOutOfOtherSessions: true
)
```

#### Password reset with phone

Reset password using phone verification:

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signIn("+1234567890")
signIn = try await signIn.sendResetPasswordPhoneCode()
signIn = try await signIn.verifyCode("123456")
signIn = try await signIn.resetPassword(
  newPassword: "newpassword",
  signOutOfOtherSessions: true
)
```

## Sign up

### Create a new sign-up

Create a new account:

```swift
var signUp = try await clerk.auth.signUp(
  emailAddress: "newuser@email.com",
  phoneNumber: "+1234567890",
  password: "secretpassword",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  username: "johndoe",
  legalAccepted: true
)
```

### Update a sign-up

Update sign-up information:

```swift
signUp = try await signUp.update(
  emailAddress: "newuser@email.com",
  phoneNumber: "+1234567890",
  password: "secretpassword",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  username: "johndoe",
  legalAccepted: true
)
```

### Sign up with OAuth

Sign up using OAuth (e.g., Google, GitHub):

```swift
var result = try await clerk.auth.signUpWithOAuth(provider: .google)
```

### Sign up with Apple

Sign up using sign in with Apple:

```swift
var result = try await clerk.auth.signUpWithApple()
```

See the [Sign in with Apple guide](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-in-with-apple) for native iOS setup.

### Sign up with ID token

Sign up using an ID token:

```swift
var result = try await clerk.auth.signUpWithIdToken(
  idToken,
  provider: .apple,
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
)
```

### Sign up with Enterprise SSO

Sign up using [Enterprise SSO](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/overview):

var result = try await clerk.auth.signUpWithEnterpriseSSO(emailAddress: "user@company.com")
```

### Sign up with ticket

Sign up using a ticket generated from the Backend API:

```swift
var signUp = try await clerk.auth.signUpWithTicket(ticket)
```

## Continue an existing sign-up

Use these methods when you already have a `SignUp` from `clerk.auth.signUp(...)` or `clerk.auth.currentSignUp` and want to complete it with a specific factor or provider.

### Send and verify email via OTP

Send the user an [OTP](!otp) via email to verify their account. Then verify the code that the user supplies:

```swift
signUp = try await signUp.sendEmailCode()
signUp = try await signUp.verifyEmailCode("123456")
```

### Send and verify phone via OTP

Send the user an [OTP](!otp) via SMS to verify their account. Then verify the code that the user supplies:

```swift
signUp = try await signUp.sendPhoneCode()
signUp = try await signUp.verifyPhoneCode("123456")
```

## Current sign-in/sign-up

Access the in-progress sign-in or sign-up stored on the client for multi-step flows.

### Current sign-in

```swift
let currentSignIn = clerk.auth.currentSignIn
```

### Current sign-up

```swift
let currentSignUp = clerk.auth.currentSignUp
```

## Session management

The Clerk iOS SDK provides methods to manage user sessions, including signing out, switching sessions, and revoking sessions.

### Sessions

Retrieve all sessions for the current client:

```swift
let sessions = clerk.auth.sessions
```

### Active sessions

Retrieve active sessions for the current client:

```swift
let activeSessions = clerk.auth.activeSessions
```

### Get session token

Retrieve the user's session token:

```swift
guard let token = try await clerk.auth.getToken() else { return }
```

Use this token when calling your backend to authenticate the request:

```swift
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
request.setValue("Bearer \(token)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
```

### Set active session

Set the active session and optionally the [Active Organization](!active-organization):

```swift
try await clerk.auth.setActive(
  sessionId: sessionId,
  organizationId: organizationId
)
```

### Revoke session

Revoke a specific session:

```swift
let revokedSession = try await clerk.auth.revokeSession(session)
```

### Sign out

Sign out the active user:

```swift
// Sign out from all sessions.
try await clerk.auth.signOut()

// Sign out from a specific session.
try await clerk.auth.signOut(sessionId: sessionId)
```

## Auth events

Subscribe to auth events to respond to sign-in, sign-up, and session changes.

### Listen for auth events

```swift
Task {
  for await event in clerk.auth.events {
    switch event {
    case .signInCompleted(let signIn):
      dump(signIn)
    case .signUpCompleted(let signUp):
      dump(signUp)
    case .signedOut(let session):
      dump(session)
    case .sessionChanged(let session):
      dump(session)
    }
  }
}
```
