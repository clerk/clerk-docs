# Clerk environment variables

You can use environment variables to configure how your Clerk app behaves, such as where users are redirected after signing out of their account, or whether or not Clerk's telemetry should be enabled.

This page is a reference for all available Clerk environment variables.

## Sign-in and sign-up redirects

Components, such as [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider), [`<UserButton>`](/docs/components/user/user-button), and more, provide props, such as `afterSignUpUrl`, for you to specify where users will be redirected. You should use environment variables instead of these props whenever possible.

See the [Custom Redirects guide](/docs/account-portal/custom-redirects) for more information.

## Clerk publishable and secret keys

To access your Clerk app in your local project, you must specify your app's publishable keys for use in the frontend, and secret keys for use in the backend. See [the publishable and secret keys](/docs/upgrade-guides/api-keys#publishable-and-secret-keys) documentation for more information.

You can find these keys in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.

  | `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Your Clerk app's secret key, which you can find in the Clerk dashboard. It will be prefixed with `sk_test_` in development instances and `sk_live_` in production instances. **Do not expose this on the frontend with a public environment variable**. |

## Telemetry

Clerk provides environment variables for opting out of telemetry data collection. See [the telemetry documentation](/docs/telemetry) for more information.

<Tabs type="framework" items={["General", "Next.js", "React"]}>

  <Tab>
  | Variable | Description |
  | -------- | ----------- |
  | `CLERK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` | Set this to `1` to disable Clerk's telemetry data collection. |
  | `CLERK_TELEMETRY_DEBUG` | Set this to `1` to prevent telemetry data from being sent to Clerk. It will be logged to the console instead. |
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  | Variable | Description |
  | -------- | ----------- |
  | `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` | Set this to `1` to disable Clerk's telemetry data collection. |
  | `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_TELEMETRY_DEBUG` | Set this to `1` to prevent telemetry data from being sent to Clerk. It will be logged to the console instead. |

  If you are using `@clerk/clerk-react` directly, or using an SDK that doesn't have environment variable support, you can opt out by passing the `telemetry` prop to `<ClerkProvider />`. See [the telemetry documentation](/docs/telemetry) for more information.
