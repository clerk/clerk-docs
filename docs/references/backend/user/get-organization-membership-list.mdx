{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/api/endpoints/UserApi.ts#L214 */}

Retrieves a list of organization memberships for a given user.

```ts
function getOrganizationMembershipList(
  params: GetOrganizationMembershipListParams,
): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<OrganizationMembership[]>>
```

## `GetOrganizationMembershipListParams`

<Properties>
  - `userId`
  - `string`

  The ID of the user to retrieve the list of organization memberships for.

  ---

  - `limit?`
  - `number`

  The number of results to return. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than 501. Can be used for paginating the results together with `offset`. Defaults to `10`.

  ---

  - `offset?`
  - `number`

  Skip the first `offset` results when paginating. Needs to be an integer greater or equal to zero. To be used in conjunction with `limit`. Defaults to `0`.
</Properties>

## Examples

> [!NOTE]
> Learn how to [get the `userId` and other properties](/docs/references/backend/overview#get-the-user-id-and-other-properties).

In this example, you can see that the returned [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) includes `data`, which is an array of [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/references/javascript/organization-membership) objects, and `totalCount`, which indicates the total number of organization memberships in the system for the specified organization.

```tsx
const userId = 'user_123'

const response = await clerkClient.users.getOrganizationMembershipList({ userId })

console.log(response)
/*
{
  data: [
    _OrganizationMembership {
      id: 'orgmem_123',
      role: 'org:admin',
      publicMetadata: {},
      privateMetadata: {},
      createdAt: 1706722393158,
      updatedAt: 1706722393158,
      organization: [_Organization],
      publicUserData: [_OrganizationMembershipPublicUserData]
    },
    _OrganizationMembership {
      id: 'orgmem_456',
      role: 'org:admin',
      publicMetadata: {},
      privateMetadata: {},
      createdAt: 1706722361154,
      updatedAt: 1706722361154,
      organization: [_Organization],
      publicUserData: [_OrganizationMembershipPublicUserData]
    }
  ],
  totalCount: 2
}
*/
```

### Limit the number of results

Retrieves a list of a user's organization memberships that is filtered by the number of results.

```tsx
const userId = 'user_123'

const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.users.getOrganizationMembershipList({
  userId,
  // returns the first 10 memberships
  limit: 10,
})
```

### Skip results

Retrieves a list of a user's organization memberships that is filtered by the number of results to skip.

```tsx
const userId = 'user_123'

const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.users.getOrganizationMembershipList({
  userId,
  // skips the first 10 memberships
  offset: 10,
})
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/users/{user_id}/organization_memberships`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/UsersGetOrganizationMemberships){{ target: '_blank' }} for more details.
