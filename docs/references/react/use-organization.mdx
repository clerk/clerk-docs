title: useOrganization()
description: Access and manage the currently active organization in your React application with Clerk's useOrganization() hook.
---

The `useOrganization()` hook retrieves attributes of the currently active organization.

## Parameters

`useOrganization()` accepts a single object with the following optional properties:

<Properties>
  - `invitations`
  - `true | { status?: OrganizationInvitationStatus } & { SharedProperties }`

  If set to `true`, all default properties will be used. Otherwise, accepts an object with an optional `status` property of type [`OrganizationInvitationStatus`](#organization-invitation-status) and any of the properties described in [Shared properties](#shared-properties).

  ---

  - `membershipRequests`
  - `true | { status?: OrganizationInvitationStatus } & { SharedProperties }`

  If set to `true`, all default properties will be used. Otherwise, accepts an object with an optional `status` property of type [`OrganizationInvitationStatus`](#organization-invitation-status) and any of the properties described in [Shared properties](#shared-properties).

  ---

  - `memberships`
  - `true | { role?: OrganizationCustomRoleKey[] } & { SharedProperties }`

    If set to `true`, all default properties will be used. Otherwise, accepts an object with an optional `role` property of type [`OrganizationCustomRoleKey[]`](#organization-custom-role-key) and any of the properties described in [Shared properties](#shared-properties).

  ---

  - `domains`
  - `true | { enrollmentMode?: OrganizationEnrollmentMode } & { SharedProperties }`

    If set to `true`, all default properties will be used. Otherwise, accepts an object with an optional `enrollmentMode` property of type [`OrganizationEnrollmentMode`](#organization-enrollment-mode) and any of the properties described in [Shared properties](#shared-properties).
</Properties>

> [!WARNING]
> By default, the `memberships`, `invitations`, `membershipRequests`, and `domains` attributes aren't populated. You must pass `true` or an object with the desired [properties](#shared-properties) to fetch and paginate the data.

### Shared properties

Properties that are shared across the `invitations`, `membershipRequests`, `memberships`, and `domains` properties.

<Properties>
  - `initialPage`
  - `number`

  A number that specifies which page to fetch. For example, if `initialPage` is set to 10, it will skip the first 9 pages and fetch the 10th page. Defaults to `1`.

  ---

  - `pageSize`
  - `number`

  A number that specifies the maximum number of results to return per page. Defaults to `10`.

  ---

  - `keepPreviousData`
  - `boolean`

  If `true`, the previous data will be kept in the cache until new data is fetched. Defaults to `false`.

  ---

  - `infinite`
  - `boolean`

  If `true`, newly fetched data will be appended to the existing list rather than replacing it. Useful for implementing infinite scroll functionality. Defaults to `false`.
</Properties>

### `OrganizationInvitationStatus`

`useOrganization()` accepts `status` as a property for the `invitations` and `membershipRequests` parameters.

`status` is a string that can be one of the following:

```typescript
type OrganizationInvitationStatus = 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'revoked'
```

### `OrganizationCustomRoleKey`

`useOrganization` accepts `role` as a property for the `memberships` parameter.

`role` is a string that represents the user's role in the organization. Clerk provides the [default roles](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#default-roles) `org:admin` and `org:member`. However, you can create [custom roles](/docs/organizations/create-roles-permissions) as well.

### `OrganizationEnrollmentMode`

`useOrganization()` accepts `enrollmentMode` as a property for the `domains` paramater.

`enrollmentMode` is a string that can be one of the following:

```typescript
type OrganizationEnrollmentMode =
  | 'manual_invitation'
  | 'automatic_invitation'
  | 'automatic_suggestion'
```

> [!NOTE]
> These attributes are updating automatically and will re-render their respective components whenever you set a different organization using the [`setActive({ organization })`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods#set-active) method or update any of the memberships or invitations. No need for you to manage updating anything manually.

## Returns

## How to use the `useOrganization()` hook

### Expand and paginate attributes

To keep network usage to a minimum, developers are required to opt-in by specifying which resource they need to fetch and paginate through. By default, the `memberships`, `invitations`, `membershipRequests`, and `domains` attributes are not populated. You must pass `true` or an object with the desired [properties](#shared-properties) to fetch and paginate the data.

```jsx
// invitations.data will never be populated.
const { invitations } = useOrganization()

// Use default values to fetch invitations, such as initialPage = 1 and pageSize = 10
const { invitations } = useOrganization({
  invitations: true,
})

// Pass your own values to fetch invitations
const { invitations } = useOrganization({
  invitations: {
    pageSize: 20,
    initialPage: 2, // skips the first page
  },
})

// Aggregate pages in order to render an infinite list
const { invitations } = useOrganization({
  invitations: {
    infinite: true,
  },
})
```

### Infinite pagination

The following example demonstrates how to use the `infinite` property to fetch and append new data to the existing list. The `memberships` attribute will be populated with the first page of the organization's memberships. When the "Load more" button is clicked, the `fetchNext` helper function will be called to append the next page of memberships to the list.

```jsx
import { useOrganization } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

export default function MemberList() {
  const { memberships } = useOrganization({
    memberships: {
      infinite: true, // Append new data to the existing list
      keepPreviousData: true, // Persist the cached data until the new data has been fetched
    },
  })

  if (!memberships) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Organization members</h2>
      <ul>
        {memberships.data?.map((membership) => (
          <li key={membership.id}>
            {membership.publicUserData.firstName} {membership.publicUserData.lastName} &lt;
            {membership.publicUserData.identifier}&gt; :: {membership.role}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <button
        disabled={!memberships.hasNextPage} // Disable the button if there are no more available pages to be fetched
        onClick={memberships.fetchNext}
      >
        Load more
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Simple pagination

The following example demonstrates how to use the `fetchPrevious` and `fetchNext` helper functions to paginate through the data. The `memberships` attribute will be populated with the first page of the organization's memberships. When the "Previous page" or "Next page" button is clicked, the `fetchPrevious` or `fetchNext` helper function will be called to fetch the previous or next page of memberships.

Notice the difference between this example's pagination and the infinite pagination example above.

```jsx
import { useOrganization } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

export default function MemberList() {
  const { memberships } = useOrganization({
    memberships: {
      keepPreviousData: true, // Persist the cached data until the new data has been fetched
    },
  })

  if (!memberships) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Organization members</h2>
      <ul>
        {memberships.data?.map((membership) => (
          <li key={membership.id}>
            {membership.publicUserData.firstName} {membership.publicUserData.lastName} &lt;
            {membership.publicUserData.identifier}&gt; :: {membership.role}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <button disabled={!memberships.hasPreviousPage} onClick={memberships.fetchPrevious}>
        Previous page
      </button>

      <button disabled={!memberships.hasNextPage} onClick={memberships.fetchNext}>
        Next page
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
