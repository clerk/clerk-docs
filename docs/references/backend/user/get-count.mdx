# `getCount()`

Retrieves the total number of users.

```tsx
function getCount: (params: UserCountParams) => Promise<number>;
```

## `UserCountParams`

The total count of users can be filtered down by adding one or more of these parameters.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `emailAddress?` | `string[]` | The email addresses to filter by. |
| `phoneNumber?` | `string[]` | The phone numbers to filter by. |
| `username?` | `string[]` | The usernames to filter by. |
| `web3wallet?` | `string[]` | The web3wallet to filter by. |
| `query?` | `string` | A search query to filter users by. |
| `userId?` | `string` | The user ID's to filter by. |
| `externalId?` | `string[]` | The external ID's to filter by. |

## Examples

### Basic

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.users.getCount();

console.log(response);
/*
369
*/
```

### Filter by query

To do a broader match through a list of fields, you can use the query parameter which partially matches the fields: `userId`, `emailAddress`, `phoneNumber`, `username`, `web3Wallet`, and `externalId`.

This example retrieves the total number of users matching the query `test`.

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.users.getCount({ query: 'test' })
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/users/count`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/GetUsersCount) for more details.
