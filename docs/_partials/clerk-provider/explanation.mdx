The [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/reference/general/components/clerk-provider) component provides session and user context to Clerk's hooks and components. It's recommended to wrap your entire app at the entry point with `<ClerkProvider>` to make authentication globally accessible. See the [reference docs](/docs/reference/general/components/clerk-provider) for other configuration options.
