# Localization prop

Clerk offers the ability to override the strings for all of the elements in each of the Clerk Components. This allows you to provide localization for your users or change the wording to suit your brand.

## `@clerk/localizations`

The `@clerk/localizations` package contains predefined localizations for the Clerk Components. Clerk currently supports:

*   cz-CZ
*   da-DK
*   de-DE
*   el-GR
*   en-US (default)
*   es-ES
*   fr-FR
*   he-IL
*   it-IT
*   ja-JP
*   ko-KR
*   nb-NO
*   nl-NL
*   pl-PL
*   pt-BR
*   ru-RU
*   sk-SK
*   sv-SE
*   tr-TR
*   uk-UA
*   vi-VN
*   zh-CN

### Usage

<CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/localizations
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add @clerk/localizations
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @clerk/localizations
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

```tsx filename="_app.tsx"
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { frFR } from "@clerk/localizations";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider localization={frFR} {...pageProps}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

## Custom localizations

You can also provide your own localizations for the Clerk Components. This is useful if you want to provide localization for a language that Clerk doesn't currently support or if you want to change the wording to suit your brand.

### Usage

```tsx filename="_app.tsx"
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";

const localization = {
  socialButtonsBlockButton: "Sign In with {{provider|titleize}}",
};

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider localization={localization} {...pageProps}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```
