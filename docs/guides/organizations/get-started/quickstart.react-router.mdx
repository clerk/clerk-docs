Organizations let you group users with roles and permissions, enabling you to build multi-tenant B2B apps like Slack (workspaces), Linear (teams), or Vercel (projects) where users can switch between different team contexts.

<Steps>
  ## Add `<OrganizationSwitcher/>` to your app

  The `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component is the easiest way to let users create, switch between, and manage organizations. It's recommended to place it in your app's header or navigation so it's always accessible to your users. For example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/root.tsx', mark: [1, 50], collapsible: true }}
  import {
    ClerkProvider,
    SignedIn,
    SignedOut,
    UserButton,
    SignInButton,
    Organization,
  } from '@clerk/react-router'
  import { isRouteErrorResponse, Links, Meta, Outlet, Scripts, ScrollRestoration } from 'react-router'
  import { clerkMiddleware, rootAuthLoader } from '@clerk/react-router/server'

  import type { Route } from './+types/root'
  import stylesheet from './app.css?url'

  export const middleware: Route.MiddlewareFunction[] = [clerkMiddleware()]

  export const loader = (args: Route.LoaderArgs) => rootAuthLoader(args)

  export const links: Route.LinksFunction = () => [
    { rel: 'preconnect', href: 'https://fonts.googleapis.com' },
    {
      rel: 'preconnect',
      href: 'https://fonts.gstatic.com',
      crossOrigin: 'anonymous',
    },
    {
      rel: 'stylesheet',
      href: 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:ital,opsz,wght@0,14..32,100..900;1,14..32,100..900&display=swap',
    },
    { rel: 'stylesheet', href: stylesheet },
  ]

  export function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    return (
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <meta charSet="utf-8" />
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
          <Meta />
          <Links />
        </head>
        <body>
          {children}
          <ScrollRestoration />
          <Scripts />
        </body>
      </html>
    )
  }

  // Pull in the `loaderData` from the `rootAuthLoader()` function
  export default function App({ loaderData }: Route.ComponentProps) {
    return (
      // Pass the `loaderData` to the `<ClerkProvider>` component
      <ClerkProvider loaderData={loaderData}>
        <header className="flex items-center justify-center py-8 px-4">
          <OrganizationSwitcher />
          {/* Show the sign-in button when the user is signed out */}
          <SignedOut>
            <SignInButton />
          </SignedOut>
          {/* Show the user button when the user is signed in */}
          <SignedIn>
            <UserButton />
          </SignedIn>
        </header>
        <Outlet />
      </ClerkProvider>
    )
  }

  export function ErrorBoundary({ error }: Route.ErrorBoundaryProps) {
    let message = 'Oops!'
    let details = 'An unexpected error occurred.'
    let stack: string | undefined

    if (isRouteErrorResponse(error)) {
      message = error.status === 404 ? '404' : 'Error'
      details =
        error.status === 404 ? 'The requested page could not be found.' : error.statusText || details
    } else if (import.meta.env.DEV && error && error instanceof Error) {
      details = error.message
      stack = error.stack
    }

    return (
      <main className="pt-16 p-4 container mx-auto">
        <h1>{message}</h1>
        <p>{details}</p>
        {stack && (
          <pre className="w-full p-4 overflow-x-auto">
            <code>{stack}</code>
          </pre>
        )}
      </main>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Access organization data

  Use Clerk's [`useOrganization()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-organization) hook to access information about the currently active organization. Use Clerk's [`useOrganizationList()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-organization-list) hook to access information about the current user's organization memberships.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/welcome/welcome.tsx', mark: [2, [5, 8], [22, 38]] }}
  import { useOrganization, useOrganizationList } from '@clerk/react-router'

  export function Welcome() {
    const { organization } = useOrganization()
    const { userMemberships } = useOrganizationList({
      userMemberships: true,
    })

    return (
      <div className="p-8">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
          Welcome to the <strong>{organization?.name}</strong> organization
        </h1>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Your role in this organization:{' '}
          <strong>
            {
              userMemberships?.data?.find(
                (membership) => membership.organization.id === organization?.id,
              )?.role
            }
          </strong>
        </p>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Visit your app

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit your app locally at [`localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173).

  ### Enable organizations

  When prompted, select **Enable Organizations**.

  ### Create first user and organization

  You must sign in to use organizations. When prompted, select **Sign in to continue**. Then, authenticate to create your first user.

  Since you selected disabled personal accounts when you enabled organizations, every user must be in at least one organization. [Clerk will prompt you](!choose-organization) to create an organization for your user.

  ## Create and switch organizations

  At this point, Clerk should have redirected you to a page with the [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher) component. This component allows you to create, switch between, and manage organizations.

  1. Select the `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component, then **Create an organization**.
  1. Enter `Acme Corp` as the organization name.
  1. Invite users to your organization and select their role.

  ## Protect routes by organization and roles

  You can protect content and even entire routes based on organization membership, roles, and permissions by performing [authorization checks](!authorization-check).

  In the following example, the page is protected from unauthenticated users, users that don't have the `org:admin` role, and users that are not in the `Acme Corp` organization.

  - The [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object is used to access the `isSignedIn` and `has()` properties.
  - The `isSignedIn` property is used to check if the user is signed in.
  - The `has()` helper is used to check if the user has the `org:admin` role.
  - The [`useOrganization()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-organization) hook is used to access the organization data.
  - The organization name is checked to ensure it matches the required organization name. If a user is not in the required organization, the page will display a message.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/protected.tsx', collapsible: true }}
  import type { Route } from './+types/protected'
  import { useAuth, useOrganization } from '@clerk/react-router'

  export function meta({}: Route.MetaArgs) {
    return [
      { title: 'Protected Page' },
      { name: 'description', content: 'A protected page requiring admin access' },
    ]
  }

  export default function Protected() {
    // The `useAuth()` hook gives you access to
    // properties like `isSignedIn` and `has()`
    const { isSignedIn, has } = useAuth()
    const { organization } = useOrganization()

    // Check if the user is authenticated
    if (!isSignedIn) {
      return <p>You must be signed in to access this page.</p>
    }

    // Check if there is an Active Organization
    if (!organization) {
      return (
        <>
          <p>Set an Active Organization to access this page.</p>
        </>
      )
    }

    // Check if the user has the `org:admin` Role
    if (!has({ role: 'org:admin' })) {
      return <p>You must be an admin to access this page.</p>
    }

    // Check if Organization name matches (e.g., "Acme Corp")
    const requiredOrgName = 'Acme Corp'
    if (organization.name !== requiredOrgName) {
      return (
        <>
          <p>
            This page is only accessible in the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> organization.
            Switch to the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> organization to access this page.
          </p>
        </>
      )
    }

    return (
      <p>
        You are currently signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> in the{' '}
        <strong>{organization.name}</strong> organization.
      </p>
    )
  }
  ```

  Update your main App so it shows the `<Protected/>` component when you land on `/protected`.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes.ts', mark: [5] }}
  import { type RouteConfig, index, route } from '@react-router/dev/routes'

  export default [
    index('routes/home.tsx'),
    route('protected', 'routes/protected.tsx'),
  ] satisfies RouteConfig
  ```

  Navigate to [`localhost:5173/protected`](localhost:5173/protected). You should see a green message confirming you are an admin in `Acme Corp`. Use the `<OrganizationSwitcher/>` to switch organizations or rename the organization to show the red message.

  Learn more about protecting routes and checking organization roles in the [authorization guide](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions).

  ## It's time to build your B2B SaaS!

  You've added Clerk organizations to your Next.js app 🎉. If your app needs to scale to enterprise customers, here's what you can do next:

  To make configuration changes to your Clerk development instance, claim the Clerk keys that were generated for you by selecting **Claim your application** in the bottom right of your app. This will associate the application with your Clerk account.

  - **Control access** with [custom roles and permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions): define granular permissions for different user types within organizations.

  - **Onboard entire companies** with [verified domains](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/verified-domains): automatically invite users with approved email domains (e.g., `@company.com`) to join organizations without manual invitations.

  - **Enable enterprise SSO** with [SAML and OIDC](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/sso): let customers authenticate through their identity provider (Okta, Entra ID, Google Workspace) with unlimited connections, no per-connection fees.
</Steps>
