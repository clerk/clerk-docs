This guide will teach you how to add native Sign in with Google to your Clerk apps on Android platforms.

<Steps>
  ## Enable Google as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Google**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Authorized Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ## Create the Google Developer Android client

  1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  1. Select a project or [create a new one](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate). You'll be redirected to your project's **Dashboard** page.
  1. In the top-left, select the menu icon (**â‰¡**) and select **APIs & Services**. Then, select **Credentials**.
  1. Next to **Credentials**, select **Create Credentials**. Then, select **OAuth client ID.** You might need to [configure your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849#userconsent). Otherwise, you'll be redirected to the **Create OAuth client ID** page.
  1. Select Android for application type for your project.
  1. Enter your package name and SHA-1 for your Android application.

  ## Create the Google Developer Web client

  1. In the same project you create above, create a new client
  1. Select **Web Application** type for your project
  1. In the **Authorized Redirect URIs** setting, paste the **Authorized Redirect URI** value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Create**. A modal will open with your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save these values somewhere secure.

  ## Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ## Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/test-your-connection" />

  > [!WARNING]
  > Google sign-in [**does not** allow users to sign in via in-app browsers](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/modernizing-oauth-interactions-in-native-apps-for-better-usability-and-security).

  ## Setup the Clerk Android SDK in your project

  <Include src="_partials/android/setup-android-sdk" />

  ## Build your sign-in flow

  Once you have setup your application correctly in the Clerk Dashboard with your client secret and ID you, you can authenticate with Google using Clerk by calling [`SignIn.authenticateWithGoogle()`](https://clerk-android.clerkstage.dev/source/com.clerk.signin/-sign-in/-companion/authenticate-with-google.html) and Clerk will handle the rest!

  First, listen for Clerk SDK initialization to complete in your ViewModel, and add a function that calls `SignIn.authenticateWithGoogle()`

  ```kotlin{{filename: 'HomeViewModel.kt', mark:[[19,24]]}}
  class HomeViewModel: ViewModel() {
    private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow<HomeUiState>(HomeUiState.Loading)
    val uiState = _uiState.asStateFlow()

    init {
      Clerk.isInitialized
        .onEach { isInitialized ->
          if (isInitialized) {
            if (Clerk.user != null) {
              _uiState.value = HomeUiState.SignedIn
            } else {
              _uiState.value = HomeUiState.SignedOut
            }
          }
        }
        .launchIn(viewModelScope)
    }

    fun signInWithGoogle() {
      viewModelScope.launch {
        SignIn.authenticateWithGoogle().onSuccess { _uiState.value = HomeUiState.SignedIn }
      }
    }
  }

  sealed interface HomeUiState {
      data object Loading : HomeUiState
      data object SignedIn : HomeUiState
      data object SignedOut : HomeUiState
  }
  ```

  Then in your activity, listen for state changes and add a button that calls `signInWithGoogle()`

  ```kotlin{{filename: 'HomeActivity.kt', mark:[19]}}
  class HomeActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
      super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
      setContent {

        val viewModel: HomeViewModel by viewModels()
        val state by viewModel.uiState.collectAsState()

        Box(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(), contentAlignment = Alignment.Center) {
          when (state) {
            HomeUiState.Loading -> {
              CircularProgressIndicator()
            }

            HomeUiState.SignedIn -> {
              // Show signed in content
            }
            HomeUiState.SignedOut -> {
              Button(onClick = { viewModel.signInWithGoogle() }) { Text("Sign in with Google") }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</Steps>
