<Steps>
  ## Create a new Next.js application

  Run the following command to [create a new Next.js application](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation). It will create an app with the name `my-clerk-app`, but you can replace it with any name you want.

  ```npm
  npm create next-app@latest my-clerk-app -- --yes
  ```

  ## Install `@clerk/nextjs`

  Run the following command to install the Next.js SDK:

  ```npm
  npm install @clerk/nextjs
  ```

  ## Add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app

  [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware)\` grants you access to user authentication state throughout your app.

  <Include src="_partials/nextjs/nextjs-15-callout" />

  1. Create a `proxy.ts` file.

     - If you're using the `/src` directory, create `proxy.ts` in the `/src` directory.
     - If you're not using the `/src` directory, create `proxy.ts` in the root directory.

  1. In your `proxy.ts` file, export the `clerkMiddleware()` helper:

     ```tsx {{ filename: 'proxy.ts' }}
     import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

     export default clerkMiddleware()

     export const config = {
       matcher: [
         // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
         '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
         // Always run for API routes
         '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
       ],
     }
     ```

  1. By default, `clerkMiddleware()` will not protect any routes. All routes are public and you must opt-in to protection for routes. See the [`clerkMiddleware()` reference](/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware) to learn how to require authentication for specific routes.

  ## Add `<ClerkProvider>` and Clerk components to your app

  1. Add the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/reference/components/clerk-provider) component to your app's layout. This component provides Clerk's authentication context to your app.
  1. Copy and paste the following file into your `layout.tsx` file. This creates a header with Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/reference/components/overview) to allow users to sign in and out.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx', mark: [[2, 9], 34, [37, 49], 53], fold: [[12, 27]] }}
  import type { Metadata } from 'next'
  import {
    ClerkProvider,
    SignInButton,
    SignUpButton,
    SignedIn,
    SignedOut,
    UserButton,
  } from '@clerk/nextjs'
  import { Geist, Geist_Mono } from 'next/font/google'
  import './globals.css'

  const geistSans = Geist({
    variable: '--font-geist-sans',
    subsets: ['latin'],
  })

  const geistMono = Geist_Mono({
    variable: '--font-geist-mono',
    subsets: ['latin'],
  })

  export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: 'Clerk Next.js Quickstart',
    description: 'Generated by create next app',
  }

  export default function RootLayout({
    children,
  }: Readonly<{
    children: React.ReactNode
  }>) {
    return (
      <ClerkProvider>
        <html lang="en">
          <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>
            <header className="flex justify-end items-center p-4 gap-4 h-16">
              <SignedOut>
                <SignInButton />
                <SignUpButton>
                  <button className="bg-[#6c47ff] text-white rounded-full font-medium text-sm sm:text-base h-10 sm:h-12 px-4 sm:px-5 cursor-pointer">
                    Sign Up
                  </button>
                </SignUpButton>
              </SignedOut>
              <SignedIn>
                <UserButton />
              </SignedIn>
            </header>
            {children}
          </body>
        </html>
      </ClerkProvider>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Create your first user

  <Include src="_partials/nextjs/create-first-user" />

  ## It's time to build!

  You've added Clerk to your Next.js app 🎉. From here, you can continue developing your application.

  To make configuration changes to your Clerk development instance, claim the Clerk keys that were generated for you by selecting **Claim your application** in the bottom right of your app. This will associate the application with your Clerk account.
