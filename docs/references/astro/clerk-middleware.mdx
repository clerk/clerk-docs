# `clerkMiddleware()`

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Astro application through Middleware.

## Configure `clerkMiddleware()`

Create a `middleware.ts` file inside your `src/` directory.

```ts filename="src/middleware.ts"
import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/astro/server";

export const onRequest = clerkMiddleware();
```

## `createRouteMatcher()`

`createRouteMatcher()` is a Clerk helper function that allows you to protect multiple routes. `createRouteMatcher()` accepts an array of routes and checks if the route the user is trying to visit matches one of the routes passed to it.

The `createRouteMatcher()` helper returns a function that, if called with the `context.request` object from the Middleware, will return `true` if the user is trying to access a route that matches one of the routes passed to `createRouteMatcher()`.

In the following example, `createRouteMatcher()` sets all `/dashboard` and `/forum` routes as protected routes.

```ts
const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/dashboard(.*)',
  '/forum(.*)',
]);
```

## Protect routes

You can protect routes by checking either or both of the following:
- [User authentication status](#protect-routes-based-on-user-authentication-status) (user is signed in or out)
- [User authorization status](#protect-routes-based-on-user-authorization-status) (user has the required role or permission)

### Protect routes based on user authentication status

You can protect routes based on user authentication status by checking if the user is signed in.

```tsx filename="src/middleware.ts"
import {
  clerkMiddleware,
  createRouteMatcher
} from '@clerk/astro/server';

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/dashboard(.*)',
  '/forum(.*)',
]);

export default clerkMiddleware((auth, context) => {
  if (!auth().userId && isProtectedRoute(req)) {
    // Add custom logic to run before redirecting

    return auth().redirectToSignIn();
  }
});
```

### Protect routes based on user authorization status

```tsx filename="src/middleware.ts"
import {
  clerkMiddleware,
  createRouteMatcher
} from '@clerk/astro/server';

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/admin(.*)',
]);

export default clerkMiddleware((auth, context) => {
  const { has, redirectToSignIn } = auth()

  // Restrict admin routes to users with specific permissions
  if (isProtectedRoute(context.request) &&
    !has({ permission: 'org:sys_memberships:manage' }) ||
    !has({ permission: 'org:sys_domains_manage' })
  ){

    // Add logic to run if the user does not have the required permissions

    return redirectToSignIn();
  }
});
```

## Protect all routes

To protect all routes in your application and define specific routes as public, you can use any of the above methods and simply invert the `if` condition.

```tsx filename=src/"middleware.ts"
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/astro/server'

const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/sign-in(.*)', '/sign-up(.*)']);

export default clerkMiddleware((auth, context) => {
  if(!isPublicRoute(context.request) && !auth().userId) {
    return auth().redirectToSignIn();
  }
});
```
