# Change domain or subdomain

Learn how to change your Clerk production instance's domain or subdomain.

<Callout type="Info">
  You cannot change the domain of the [development instance](/docs/deployments/environments#development-instance) of your Clerk application.
</Callout>

## Change domain

1. Update your production domain in two ways:
    - [the Clerk Dashboard](#update-your-domain-via-clerk-dashboard)
    - [Clerk's backend API](#update-your-domain-via-backend-api)
2. Once you make the change to your domain, you will need to update the following:
    - Update DNS records
    - Generate new SSL certificates
    - [Update your publishable key](#updating-your-publishable-key)
    - If using social connections, update the settings with your social connections so that the redirect URL they are using is correct.
    - If using JWT templates, update JWT issuer and JWKS endpoint in external JWT SSO services.

### Update your domain via Clerk Dashboard

To update your production domain in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the navigation sidebar, select **[Domains](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=domains)**.
2. Select the **Danger** tab.
3. Select **Change domain**.

### Update your domain via backend API

To update your production domain using Clerk's backend API, you will need to make a POST request to the `change_domain` endpoint. You will need to provide your new domain in the request body.

  1. Copy the following cURL command.
<SignedIn>
  2. Your secret key is required to authenticate the request. It is injected into the cURL command after `Authorization`. However, you can also find it on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of the Clerk Dashboard.
</SignedIn>
<SignedOut>
  2. Your secret key is required to authenticate the request.
      - Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) and sign in.
      - In the navigation sidebar, select **API Keys** to copy your secret key.
      - Paste your secret key into the cURL command after `Authorization`, replacing `sk_...`.
</SignedOut>
  3. Replace `YOUR_PROD_URL` with your new production domain.

<InjectKeys>

```bash
curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: {{secret}}' -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{
"home_url": "YOUR_PROD_URL"
}' 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/instance/change_domain'
```

</InjectKeys>

For more information on how to update your instance settings using the backend API, see our [backend API reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Beta-Features#operation/UpdateInstanceAuthConfig).

### Update your publishable key

After changing your domain, a new **Publishable key** will be automatically generated for your application. You will need to update your environment variables with this new key and redeploy your application. You can find your **Publishable key** on the **[API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)** page of the Clerk Dashboard.

<Callout>
  Failing to update your **Publishable key** will result in Clerk failing to load.
</Callout>

## Set, change, or remove subdomain

To set, change, or remove a subdomain for your production instance:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=domains).
2. In the navigation sidebar, select **Domains**.
3. Select the **Danger** tab.
4. You will see the **Change subdomain** section where you can set, change, or remove your subdomain.
