# `$sessionStore`

The `$sessionStore` store provides a convenient way to access the current user's [`Session`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/javascript/session) object, as well as helpers for setting the active session.

## How to use the `$sessionStore` store

The following example demonstrates how to use the `$sessionStore` store to access the `session` object, which has the `lastActiveAt` property on it. The `lastActiveAt` property is used to display the last active time of the current session to the user.

```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'session.tsx' }}
import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react';
import { $sessionStore } from '@clerk/astro/client';

export default function Home() {
  const session = useStore($sessionStore);

  if (session === undefined) {
    // Add logic to handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  if(session === null) {
    // Add logic to handle not signed in state
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>This session has been active
      since {session.lastActiveAt.toLocaleString()}
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```
