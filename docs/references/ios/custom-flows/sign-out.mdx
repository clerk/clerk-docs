# Sign out

Once you have a signed-in user, you need to give them a way to sign out.

Please note that the sign-out flow only deactivates the current session. Other valid sessions that correspond to the same user (e.g. if the user is signed in on another device) will continue to work.

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) guide.
- You need to install the correct SDK for your application. You can find steps on how to do so through Clerk's [quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/overview) guides.

## Custom sign-out

You can use the `signOut()` function to build a custom solution.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import ClerkSDK

struct SignOutView: View {
    @ObservedObject private var clerk = Clerk.shared
    
    var body: some View {
        if clerk.session != nil {
            Button("Sign Out", action: signOut)
        } else {
            Button("Sign In", action: signIn)
        }
    }
    
    private func signOut() {
        Task {
            do {
                try await clerk.signOut()
            } catch {
                print(error.localizedDescription)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
