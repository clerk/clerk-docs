description: The Backend OrganizationMembership object is the model around an organization membership entity and describes the relationship between users and organizations.

The Backend `OrganizationMembership` object is similar to the [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/references/javascript/types/organization-membership) object as it's the model around an organization membership entity and describes the relationship between users and organizations. However, the Backend `OrganizationMembership` object is different in that it's used in the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organization-Memberships#operation/CreateOrganizationMembership){{ target: '_blank' }} and is not directly accessible from the Frontend API.
