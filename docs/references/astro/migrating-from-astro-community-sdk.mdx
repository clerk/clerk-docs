# Migrating from the Astro community SDK

In July 2024, we introduced official support for Astro. This migration guide covers converting from the [`astro-clerk-auth`](https://github.com/panteliselef/astro-with-clerk-auth) community SDK to Clerk's official SDK. It covers the breaking changes that were introduced and provides examples on how to resolve them.

## Installation

Uninstall the community SDK and install Clerk's new offical SDK for Astro.

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
  npm uninstall astro-clerk-auth
  npm install @clerk/astro
  ```

  ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
  yarn remove astro-clerk-auth
  yarn add @clerk/astro
  ```

  ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
  pnpm remove astro-clerk-auth
  pnpm add @clerk/astro
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Breaking Changes

### The integration

With the community SDK, you could choose to either hotload Clerk's `clerk-js` library or bundle it with your application.

With Clerk's official SDK, `clerk-js` is hotloaded by default, and the option to use the bundled `clerk-js` variant has been removed.

The following changes are required in your Astro configuration file:

```diff {{ prettier: false }}
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import node from "@astrojs/node";

- import clerk from "astro-clerk-auth/hotload";
- import clerk from "astro-clerk-auth/integration/hotload";
- import clerk from "astro-clerk-auth";
- import clerk from "astro-clerk-auth/integration";
+ import clerk from "@clerk/astro";

export default defineConfig({
      integrations: [clerk()],
      adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }),
      output: "server",
});
```

### Prefix for environment variables

The prefix for environment variables used in client-side code has been updated to align with Astro's [best practices](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/). This change affects all [environment variables](https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables) supported by Clerk.

```diff {{ prettier: false }}
- PUBLIC_ASTRO_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
+ PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=

- PUBLIC_ASTRO_APP_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=
+ PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=

- PUBLIC_ASTRO_APP_*=
+ PUBLIC_*=

```

### Astro component export updates

The Astro components have been restructured to provide a more consistent API. The following changes are required to import your Astro components:

```diff {{ prettier: false }}
- import { UserProfile } from "@clerk/astro/components/interactive"
+ import { UserProfile } from "@clerk/astro/components"

- import { Protect } from "@clerk/astro/components/control"
+ import { Protect } from "@clerk/astro/components"

- import { SignInButton } from "@clerk/astro/components/unstyled"
+ import { SignInButton } from "@clerk/astro/components"

```

### Stores

Submodule `/stores` was replaced with `/client`. The following changes are required to import the [stores](/docs/references/astro/overview#client-side-helpers):

```diff {{ prettier: false }}
- import { $clerk } from "astro-clerk-auth/stores"
+ import { $clerkStore } from "@clerk/astro/client"


- import { $csrState } from "astro-clerk-auth/stores"
- import { $initialState } from "astro-clerk-auth/stores"
+ import { $userStore } from "@clerk/astro/client"
+ import { $sessionStore } from "@clerk/astro/client"
```

### Submodule removal

Submodule `/v0` was dropped completely and the previously exported constants are no longer available.

```diff {{ prettier: false }}
- import { apiKey, secretKey, DOMAIN, ... } from "astro-clerk-auth/v0"
```

### `clerkClient` changes

The `clerkClient` variable has been deprecated and should now be used as a function that accepts the Astro context.

```diff {{ prettier: false }}
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";
- import { clerkClient } from "astro-clerk-auth/v0"
+ import { clerkClient } from "@clerk/astro/server"

export const GET: APIRoute = async (context) => {
-   clerkClient.users.getUser(...)
+   clerkClient(context).users.getUser(...)
  ...
};
```

### React components changes

With the community SDK, there were to ways to use a React component inside a `.astro` file.

To avoid confusion, the official SDK removes the `/components/react` submodule.

```diff {{ prettier: false }}
---
- import { SignedIn } from "@clerk/astro/components/react";
+ import { SignedIn } from "@clerk/astro/react";
---

- <SignedIn>
+ <SignedIn client:load>
    {...}
</SignedIn>
```

To use a React component inside a `.jsx` or `.tsx` file, update the import path.

```diff {{ prettier: false }}
import {
    SignInButton,
    SignedIn,
    SignedOut,
    UserButton
- } from '@clerk/astro/client/react'
+ } from '@clerk/astro/react'

export default function Header() {
      return (
        <>
          <p>My App</p>
          <SignedOut>
            <SignInButton />
          </SignedOut>
          <SignedIn>
            <UserButton />
          </SignedIn>
        </>
      )
}
```
