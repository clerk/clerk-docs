description: The current active `SignIn` instance, for use in custom flows.
sdk: js-frontend

<Include src="_partials/custom-flows/future-api-callout" />

The `SignInFuture` class holds the state of the current sign-in and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-in process. It is used to manage the sign-in lifecycle, including the first and second factor verification, and the creation of a new session.

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `createdSessionId`
  - `null | string`

  The identifier of the session that was created upon completion of the current sign-in. The value of this property is `null` if the sign-in status is not `'complete'`.

  ---

  - `existingSession?`
  - `{ sessionId: string }`

  If present, reflects that the sign-in was not able to create a new session because the identifier already exists in an existing session. Contains the ID of the existing session.

  ---

  - `firstFactorVerification`
  - [`VerificationResource`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/verification)

  The state of the verification process for the selected first factor. Initially, this property contains an empty verification object, since there is no first factor selected.

  ---

  - `id?`
  - `string`

  The unique identifier for the current sign-in attempt.

  ---

  - `identifier`
  - `null | string`

  The authentication identifier value for the current sign-in. `null` if the `strategy` is `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`.

  ---

  - `isTransferable`
  - `boolean`

  Indicates that there is not a matching user for the first-factor verification used, and that the sign-in can be transferred to a sign-up.

  ---

  - `secondFactorVerification`
  - [`VerificationResource`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/verification)

  The state of the verification process for the selected second factor. Initially, this property contains an empty verification object, since there is no second factor selected.

  ---

  - `status`
  - `SignInStatus`

  The current status of the sign-in.

  ---

  - `supportedFirstFactors`
  - <code>[SignInFirstFactor](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sign-in-first-factor)\[]</code>

  Array of the first factors that are supported in the current sign-in. Each factor contains information about the verification strategy that can be used.

  ---

  - `supportedSecondFactors`
  - <code>[SignInSecondFactor](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sign-in-second-factor)\[]</code>

  Array of the second factors that are supported in the current sign-in. Each factor contains information about the verification strategy that can be used. his property is populated only when the first factor is verified.

  ---

  - `userData`
  - `UserData`

  An object containing information about the user of the current sign-in. This property is populated only once an identifier is given to the `SignIn` object through `signIn.create()` or another method that populates the `identifier` property.
</Properties>

## Methods

### `create()`

Creates a new `SignIn` instance initialized with the provided parameters. The instance maintains the sign-in lifecycle state through its `status` property, which updates as the authentication flow progresses.

What you must pass to `params` depends on which [sign-in options](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options) you have enabled in your app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard.

You can complete the sign-in process in one step if you supply the required fields to `create()`. Otherwise, Clerk's sign-in process provides great flexibility and allows users to easily create multi-step sign-in flows.

> [!WARNING]
> Once the sign-in process is complete, call the `signIn.finalize()` method to set the newly created session as the active session.

```ts
function create(params: SignInFutureCreateParams): Promise<{ error: unknown }>
```

#### `SignInFutureCreateParams`

<Properties>
  - `actionCompleteRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The URL that the user will be redirected to, after successful authorization from the OAuth provider and Clerk sign-in.

  ---

  - `identifier?`
  - `string`

  The authentication identifier for the sign-in. This can be the value of the user's email address, phone number, username, or Web3 wallet address.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The full URL or path that the OAuth provider should redirect to after successful authorization on their part.

  ---

  - `strategy?`
  - <code>[OAuthStrategy](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sso#o-auth-strategy) | "saml" | "enterprise\_sso"</code>

  The first factor verification strategy to use in the sign-in flow. Depends on the `identifier` value. Each authentication identifier supports different verification strategies.

  ---

  - `ticket?`
  - `string`

  The [ticket _or token_](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/application-invitations) generated from the Backend API. **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'ticket'`.

  ---

  - `transfer?`
  - `boolean`

  When set to `true`, the `SignIn` will attempt to retrieve information from the active `SignUp` instance and use it to complete the sign-in process. This is useful when you want to seamlessly transition a user from a sign-up attempt to a sign-in attempt.
