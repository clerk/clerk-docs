## Tutorial

<Steps>
  ### Set up an enterprise connection in Clerk

  To create a SAML connection in Clerk:

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).
  1. In the navigation sidebar, select **User & Authentication > [Enterprise Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/enterprise-connections)**.
  1. Select the **Create connection** button.
  1. You will be presented with a modal to create a new connection. Fill in the required fields and for the **Identity Provider**, select **Google Workspace**.
  1. Next, on the **Connection** page, **do not select the Enable connection toggle just yet.** You need to fully configure your IdP first before exposing your connection to your users.
  1. Leave this page open. You will need to come back to it to complete the setup.

  ### Create a new enterprise application in Google

  To create a new enterprise application in Google:

  1. Navigate to the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/) and sign in.
  1. In the navigation sidebar, under **Apps**, select **Web and mobile apps**.
  1. Select the **Add app** button.
  1. From the dropdown, select **Add custom SAML app**.
  1. In the **App details** section, an **App name** is required.
  1. Select the **Continue** button.

  ### Configure your identity provider

  There are two options for configuring your IdP:

  - [**Metadata configuration**](#metadata-configuration) - This is where you can input the URL to your IdP's metadata file. This is the recommended way to configure your IdP.
  - [**Custom configuration**](#custom-configuration) - This is where you can manually input the configuration settings for your IdP.

  #### Metadata configuration

  1. In the Google Admin Console, under **Option 1: Download IdP Metadata**, select the **Download Metadata** button.
  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, find the **Identity Provider configuration** section.
  1. Under the **Metadata configuration** option, select the **Upload** button.
  1. Upload the metadata file you downloaded from Google.
  1. Select the **Save changes** button to complete the setup.

  #### Custom configuration

  If you choose to manually input the configuration settings for your IdP, you must add these three fields to your Clerk settings:

  - **SSO URL** - This is the unique identifier of your IdP application.
  - **Entity ID** - This is your IdP's URL that Clerk will redirect your users to so that they can authenticate.
  - **Certificate** - This is the certificate needed for Clerk to securely connect to your IdP.

  1. In the Google Admin Console, under **Option 2**, copy the **SSO URL**, **Entity ID**, and download the **Certificate**.
  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, find the **Identity Provider configuration** section.
  1. Select the **Custom configuration** option.
  1. Fill in the **SSO URL**, **Entity ID**, and upload the **Certificate**.
  1. Select the **Save changes** button in the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select the **Continue** button in the Google Admin Console.

  ### Configure your service provider

  To configure your service provider (Clerk), you will need to add these two fields to your IdP's application:

  - **ACS URL** - This is a unique identifier for your SAML connection that your IdP application needs.
  - **Entity ID** - This is your application's URL that your IdP will redirect your users back to after they have authenticated in your IdP.

  To fill out the appropriate values for these fields:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, find the **Service Provider configuration** section.
  1. Copy the **ACS URL** and **Entity ID**.
  1. In the Google Admin Console, paste these values into their respective fields.
  1. Under the **Name ID** section, select the dropdown for **Name ID format** and select **Email**.

  ### Map Google claims to Clerk attributes

  Mapping the claims in your IdP to the attributes in Clerk ensures that the data from your IdP is correctly mapped to the data in Clerk.

  | Clerk attribute | Google claim |
  | - | - |
  | `mail` | Basic Information > Primary email |
  | `firstName` | Basic Information > First name |
  | `lastName` | Basic Information > Last name |

  The only Google claim that is necessary to map is the **Primary email**. This is the email address that your users will use to log in to your application.

  1. In the Google Admin Console, under the **Attributes** section, select the dropdown under **Google Directory attributes**.
  1. Select **Primary email**.
  1. Select the dropdown under **App attributes**.
  1. Enter `mail` in the field.
  1. If you have additional claims that you would like to map to Clerk, you can do so by following the steps in the [Map other claims](#map-other-claims-optional) section. Otherwise, select the **Finish** button.

  #### Map other claims (optional)

  In Clerk, the [`User`](/docs/users/overview#user-object) object has a `publicMetadata` property that you can use to store additional information about your users.

  To map other claims from Google that don't have a direct mapping to Clerk attributes, you can map them to the `publicMetadata` property. To do this, prepend the Clerk claims with `public_metadata_` during the mapping process.

  For example, say your users have the "Phone number" attribute in Google. You can map this to your users' public metadata in Clerk by mapping the Google field to `public_metadata_phone_number`.

  1. In the Google Admin Console, under the **Attributes** section, select the dropdown under **Google Directory attributes**.
  1. Select **Phone number**.
  1. Select the empty input under **App attributes**.
  1. Enter `public_metadata_phone_number` in the field.
  1. Select the **Finish** button.

  The value for the user's phone number will be saved in the user's `User.publicMetadata` under the key `phone_number`.

  ### Enable the connection for Google

  Once the configuration is complete, you will be redirected to the app details page.

  1. In the **User access** section, select **View details**.
  1. In the **Service status** section, select **ON for everyone**.
  1. Select the **Save** button.

  ### Enable the connection for Clerk

  To make the connection available for your users to authenticate with:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, scroll to the top of the **Connection** page.
  1. Toggle on the **Enable connection** option.
