# Manual JWT verification

Your Clerk-generated [session tokens](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens) are essentially JWTs which are signed using your instance's private key and can be verified using your instance's public key. Depending on your architecture, these tokens will be in your backend requests either via a cookie named `__session` or via the Authorization header.

For every request, you must validate its token to make sure it hasn't expired and it is authentic (i.e. no malicious user tried to tamper with it). If these validations pass, then it means that the user is authenticated to your application and you should consider them signed in.

The `authenticateRequest()` method from Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK does all of this for you. It accepts the request object and authenticates the session token in it. See the [reference page](/docs/references/backend/authenticate-request) for more information.

The following example uses the `authenticateRequest()` method to verify the token passed by the frontend, and performs a networkless authentication. This will verify if the user is signed into the application or not.

```tsx
import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend';

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const clerkClient = createClerkClient({
    secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY,
  });

  const { isSignedIn } = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(req);

  if (!isSignedIn) {
    return Response.json({ status: 401 });
  }

  // Perform protected actions

  return Response.json({ message: 'This is a reply' });
}
```
