Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Fastify backend for secure user authentication and management. This guide uses TypeScript and allows you to choose your frontend framework.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Fastify is only compatible with Next.js versions 13.4 and below](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-nextjs). If you're using a newer version of Next.js, consider using a different backend framework that supports the latest Next.js features.
>
> This guide uses ECMAScript Modules (ESM). To use ESM in your project, you must include `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`.

<Steps>
  ## Install `@clerk/fastify`

  [Clerk's Fastify SDK](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/tree/main/packages/fastify) provides a range of backend utilities to simplify user authentication and management in your application.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/fastify
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/fastify
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/fastify
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun add @clerk/fastify
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable and Secret Keys.
    1. Paste your keys into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ## Configure `clerkPlugin()` for all routes

  The `clerkPlugin()` function is a Fastify plugin provided by Clerk to integrate authentication into your Fastify application. To ensure that Clerk's authentication and user management features are applied across your Fastify application, configure the `clerkPlugin()` to handle all routes or limit it to specific ones.

  The following example registers the plugin for all routes. To register the plugin for specific routes, see the [reference docs](/docs/references/fastify/overview#configure-clerk-plugin-for-specific-routes).

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The `dotenv/config` module must be imported before any Clerk modules. This order is important because Clerk instances are created during the import process and rely on environment variables, such as API keys, to be initialized correctly. For more information, refer to the [Fastify docs](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Guides/Getting-Started/#loading-order-of-your-plugins).

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts' }}
  import 'dotenv/config'
  import Fastify from 'fastify'
  import { clerkPlugin } from '@clerk/fastify'

  const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true })

  fastify.register(clerkPlugin)

  const start = async () => {
    try {
      await fastify.listen({ port: 8080 })
    } catch (error) {
      fastify.log.error(error)
      process.exit(1)
    }
  }

  start()
  ```

  ## Protect your routes using `getAuth()`

  The [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/fastify/overview#get-auth) helper retrieves the current user's authentication state from the `request` object. It returns the [`Auth` object](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }}.
