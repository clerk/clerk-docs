# SDK Types

Clerk divides its SDKs into three different types:

- Frontend-only
- Backend-only
- Fullstack

Take a look at your framework and check which type it enables. Then place your SDK into one of these three categories when first creating it. Arguably, creating a fullstack SDK is the most work so feel free to start off with frontend-only/backend-only SDK — you can still make it fullstack at a later point. Also, the framework you’re building the SDK for might evolve in the future, so maybe naturally your SDK will also need to change over time.

| SDK Type | FAPI HTTP client | BAPI HTTP client | Hotloading ClerkJS | `window.Clerk` UI components | Authorization header verification | `__session` cookie verification | Handshake support |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Frontend-only | ✅ | ⬜ | ✅ | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ⬜ |
| Backend-only | ⬜ | ✅ | ⬜ | ⬜ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Fullstack | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Frontend-only

For frameworks that only support client-side rendering (CSR) or static site generation (SSG) with rehydration. The app is rendered in the browser using JavaScript and this bundle doesn’t contain any authenticated information itself but uses client-side code to fetch the authenticated data.

**Examples:** Vite React, Vue, iOS/Swift

**SDK Examples:** `@clerk/clerk-react`

## Backend-only

For frameworks to build APIs but not serve HTML directly. Will power your frontend with the authenticated data.

**Examples:** Express.js/Hono with a Vite React/Vue frontend

**SDK Examples:** `@clerk/express`, `@hono/clerk-auth`, `clerk-sdk-go`

## Fullstack

For frameworks that support SSR and subsequently can render HTML from a server with authenticated data.

**Examples:** Next.js, Rails

**SDK Examples:** `@clerk/nextjs`, `clerk-sdk-ruby`
