title: Use OAuth for scoped access
description: Learn how to use OAuth with Clerk to grant granular permissions and manage access securely.

Clerk's OAuth implementation supports scoped access, which lets third-party applications request limited access to a user's data through Clerk's API. This is an extension of the OAuth protocol that can be layered on top of Clerk's Identity Provider (IdP) functionality.

Clerk as an IdP focuses on authenticating users into third-party apps through single sign-on (SSO). OAuth scoped access goes a step further by enabling those apps to fetch or update user information from Clerk with explicit user consent.

This section covers how to configure and use OAuth scoped access in Clerk, including how to create scopes, handle user consent, and retrieve tokens that grant third-party apps secure, limited access to user data.
