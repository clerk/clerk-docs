title: "Upgrading to Clerk Core 3"
description: "Learn how to upgrade to Clerk Core 3 across all SDKs."
---

## Overview

Core 3 focuses on consistency and cleanup across Clerk's SDKs while keeping upgrade time short (usually under 30 minutes with the CLI).

- **Naming consistency:** `__unstable_*` APIs move to `__internal_*`, and experimental methods share the `__experimental_` prefix.
- **Package renaming:** `@clerk/clerk-react` becomes `@clerk/react`, `createTheme` moves to `@clerk/ui/themes/experimental`, and types consolidate under `@clerk/shared/types`.
- **Appearance updates:** `appearance.layout` is now `appearance.options`, `showOptionalFields` defaults to `false`, and color variables apply at full opacity.
- **Behavior alignment:** redirect props and legacy billing flags are removed in favor of the newer patterns.
- **Platform requirements:** Node.js 20.9.0+ is required across the updated packages.

Use `npx @clerk/upgrade` to scan your project and speed up the migration.

## Breaking Changes

The following breaking changes apply to all Clerk SDKs.

  ]}
>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The authorization control components `Protect`, `SignedIn`, and `SignedOut` have been removed in favor of a single component: `Show`.

    ### Signed in / signed out

    ```diff
    - import { SignedIn, SignedOut } from '@clerk/nextjs';
    + import { Show } from '@clerk/nextjs';

    - <SignedIn>
    + <Show when="signed-in">
        <Dashboard />
    - </SignedIn>
    + </Show>

    - <SignedOut>
    + <Show when="signed-out">
        <SignInPage />
    - </SignedOut>
    + </Show>
    ```

    ### Authorization checks (roles/permissions/features/plans)

    ```diff
    - import { Protect } from '@clerk/nextjs';
    + import { Show } from '@clerk/nextjs';

    - <Protect role="admin" fallback={<p>Unauthorized</p>}>
    + <Show when={{ role: 'admin' }} fallback={<p>Unauthorized</p>}>
        <AdminPanel />
    - </Protect>
    + </Show>

    - <Protect permission="org:billing:manage">
    + <Show when={{ permission: 'org:billing:manage' }}>
        <BillingSettings />
    - </Protect>
    + </Show>
    ```

    If you were using `condition={(has) => ...}` on `Protect`, pass that callback to `when`:

    ```diff
    - <Protect condition={(has) => has({ role: 'admin' }) && isAllowed}>
    + <Show when={(has) => has({ role: 'admin' }) && isAllowed}>
        <AdminPanel />
    - </Protect>
    + </Show>
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `@clerk/clerk-react` package has been renamed to `@clerk/react`.

    Update your imports:

    ```diff
    - import { ClerkProvider, useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-react';
    + import { ClerkProvider, useUser } from '@clerk/react';
    ```

    And update your `package.json`:

    ```diff
    - "@clerk/clerk-react": "^5.0.0",
    + "@clerk/react": "^7.0.0",
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `@clerk/clerk-expo` package has been renamed to `@clerk/expo`.

    Update your imports:

    ```diff
    - import { ClerkProvider, useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';
    + import { ClerkProvider, useUser } from '@clerk/expo';
    ```

    And update your `package.json`:

    ```diff
    - "@clerk/clerk-expo": "^2.0.0",
    + "@clerk/expo": "^3.0.0",
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `appearance.layout` property has been renamed to `appearance.options`. Update all instances in your codebase:

    ```diff
    <ClerkProvider
      appearance={{
    -   layout: {
    +   options: {
          socialButtonsPlacement: 'bottom',
          socialButtonsVariant: 'iconButton',
        }
      }}
    />
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `colorRing` and `colorModalBackdrop` CSS variables now render at full opacity when modified via the appearance prop or CSS variables. Previously, provided colors were rendered at 15% opacity.

    If you were relying on the previous behavior, you may need to adjust your color values to include the desired opacity:

    ```diff
    <ClerkProvider
      appearance={{
        variables: {
    -     colorRing: '#6366f1',
    +     colorRing: 'rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.15)',
        }
      }}
    />
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The return values of the `useCheckout` hook and the `Clerk.checkout()` method have been updated.

    ### React Hook

    ```diff
    - const { id, plan, status, start, confirm, paymentSource } = useCheckout({ planId: "xxx", planPeriod: "annual" });
    + const { checkout, errors, fetchStatus } = useCheckout({ planId: "xxx", planPeriod: "annual" });
    + // Access properties via checkout object
    + checkout.plan
    + checkout.status
    + checkout.start()
    + checkout.confirm()
    ```

    ### Vanilla JS

    ```diff
    - const { getState, subscribe, confirm, start, clear, finalize } = Clerk.checkout({ planId: "xxx", planPeriod: "annual" });
    - getState().isStarting
    - getState().checkout
    + const { checkout, errors, fetchStatus } = Clerk.checkout({ planId: "xxx", planPeriod: "annual" });
    + checkout.plan
    + checkout.status
    + checkout.start()
    + checkout.confirm()
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    All experimental methods now use the `__experimental_` prefix consistently. Update any references:

    ```diff
    - experimental_someMethod
    + __experimental_someMethod
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `createTheme` theme utility has been moved to a new export path. Update your imports:

    ```diff
    - import { __experimental_createTheme } from '@clerk/ui';
    + import { createTheme } from '@clerk/ui/themes/experimental';
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `__experimental_` prefix has been removed from the method since they're now in the `/themes/experimental` subpath.
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    All `__unstable_*` methods have been renamed to `__internal_*`. These are internal APIs not intended for public use.

    ### @clerk/clerk-js

    - `__unstable__environment` → `__internal_environment`
    - `__unstable__updateProps` → `__internal_updateProps`
    - `__unstable__setEnvironment` → `__internal_setEnvironment`
    - `__unstable__onBeforeRequest` → `__internal_onBeforeRequest`
    - `__unstable__onAfterResponse` → `__internal_onAfterResponse`
    - `__unstable__onBeforeSetActive` → `__internal_onBeforeSetActive`
    - `__unstable__onAfterSetActive` → `__internal_onAfterSetActive`

    ### @clerk/nextjs

    - `__unstable_invokeMiddlewareOnAuthStateChange` → `__internal_invokeMiddlewareOnAuthStateChange`

    ### @clerk/chrome-extension

    - `__unstable__createClerkClient` → `createClerkClient` (exported from `@clerk/chrome-extension/background`)
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

## Deprecation Removals

The following deprecated APIs have been removed from all Clerk SDKs.

<Accordion
  titles={[
    "<code>afterSwitchOrganizationUrl</code> removed from <code>OrganizationSwitcher</code>",
    "<code>Client.activeSessions</code> removed",
    "<code>hideSlug</code> prop removed",
    "<code>saml</code> strategy renamed to <code>enterprise_sso</code>",
    "<code>samlAccount</code> renamed to <code>enterpriseAccount</code>",
    "<code>setActive({ beforeEmit })</code> changed to <code>setActive({ navigate })</code>",
    "<code>UserButton</code> sign-out redirect props removed",
    "<code>UserSettings.saml</code> renamed to <code>enterpriseSSO</code>",
    "Legacy redirect props removed",
    "Unstable billing props removed",
  ]}
>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The `afterSwitchOrganizationUrl` prop has been removed from `OrganizationSwitcher`. Use `afterSelectOrganizationUrl` instead:

    ```diff
    <OrganizationSwitcher
    -  afterSwitchOrganizationUrl="/org-dashboard"
    +  afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/org-dashboard"
    />
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `activeSessions` property has been removed from the `Client` object. Use `sessions` instead:

    ```diff
    - const sessions = client.activeSessions;
    + const sessions = client.sessions;
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `hideSlug` prop has been removed. Organization slugs are now managed through the Clerk Dashboard.

    ```diff
    <OrganizationProfile
    -  hideSlug={true}
    />
    ```

    To hide organization slugs, navigate to the [**Organizations Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations) page in the Clerk Dashboard, and ensure that the **Enable organization slugs** option is enabled.
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `saml` authentication strategy has been renamed to `enterprise_sso`. Update any references in your code:

    ```diff
    - strategy: 'saml'
    + strategy: 'enterprise_sso'
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `samlAccount` property has been renamed to `enterpriseAccount`. Update your code:

    ```diff
    - user.samlAccounts
    + user.enterpriseAccounts

    - verification.samlAccount
    + verification.enterpriseAccount
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `beforeEmit` callback in `setActive()` has been replaced with `navigate`. The callback signature has also changed:

    ```diff
    await setActive({
      session: sessionId,
    - beforeEmit: () => {
    -   // Called before session is set
    - }
    + navigate: ({ session }) => {
    +   // Called with the session object
    +   return '/dashboard';
    + }
    });
    ```

    The `navigate` callback receives an object with the `session` property and should return the URL to navigate to.
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `UserButton` component no longer accepts sign-out redirect override props. Configure sign-out redirects using one of these methods:

    **Global configuration:**

    ```jsx
    <ClerkProvider afterSignOutUrl="/signed-out"></ClerkProvider>
    ```

    **Per-button with SignOutButton:**

    ```jsx
    <SignOutButton redirectUrl="/goodbye">Sign Out</SignOutButton>
    ```

    **Programmatic:**

    ```js
    clerk.signOut({ redirectUrl: '/signed-out' })
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `saml` property on `UserSettings` has been renamed to `enterpriseSSO`. Update your code:

    ```diff
    - userSettings.saml
    + userSettings.enterpriseSSO
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The legacy redirect props `afterSignInUrl`, `afterSignUpUrl`, and `redirectUrl` have been removed from components. Use the newer redirect options:

    ```diff
    <SignIn
    -  afterSignInUrl="/dashboard"
    -  afterSignUpUrl="/onboarding"
    +  fallbackRedirectUrl="/dashboard"
    +  signUpFallbackRedirectUrl="/onboarding"
    />
    ```

    For forced redirects that ignore the `redirect_url` query parameter:

    ```diff
    <SignIn
    +  forceRedirectUrl="/dashboard"
    +  signUpForceRedirectUrl="/onboarding"
    />
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The following unstable properties have been removed. If you were relying on these, please reach out to support.

    - `__unstable_manageBillingUrl`
    - `__unstable_manageBillingLabel`
    - `__unstable_manageBillingMembersLimit`
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

## Deprecations

<Accordion
  titles={[
    "<code>@clerk/types</code> deprecated in favor of <code>@clerk/shared/types</code>",
  ]}
>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The `@clerk/types` package is deprecated. All type definitions have been consolidated into `@clerk/shared/types`.

    Update your imports:

    ```diff
    - import type { ClerkResource, UserResource } from '@clerk/types';
    + import type { ClerkResource, UserResource } from '@clerk/shared/types';
    ```

    The `@clerk/types` package will continue to re-export types from `@clerk/shared/types` for backward compatibility, but new types will only be added to `@clerk/shared/types`.
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

## Version Requirements

<Accordion
  titles={[
    "Upgrade Node.js to v20.9.0 or higher",
  ]}
>
  <AccordionPanel>
    All Clerk packages now require Node.js 20.9.0 or later. Update your Node.js version and ensure your `package.json` engines field reflects this requirement.

    ```diff
    {
      "engines": {
    -   "node": ">=18.0.0"
    +   "node": ">=20.9.0"
      }
    }
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

## Behavior Changes

<Accordion
  titles={[
    "<code>showOptionalFields</code> now defaults to <code>false</code>",
    "<code>ClerkAPIError.kind</code> value updated",
  ]}
>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The default value of `appearance.layout.showOptionalFields` (now `appearance.options.showOptionalFields`) has changed from `true` to `false`. Optional fields are now hidden by default during sign up.

    To restore the previous behavior, explicitly set the option:

    ```jsx
    <ClerkProvider
      appearance={{
        options: {
          showOptionalFields: true,
        },
      }}
    >
      {/* ... */}
    </ClerkProvider>
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    `ClerkAPIError.kind` has been updated to match the class name:

    ```diff
    - static kind = 'ClerkApiError'
    + static kind = 'ClerkAPIError'
    ```

    Most users should not be affected. If you were checking this string directly (for example, `error.constructor.kind === 'ClerkApiError'`), update the comparison value.
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

## SDK-Specific Changes

The following changes only apply to specific SDKs. Select your SDK below for additional upgrade steps.

<Tabs items={['Next.js', 'React', 'Expo', 'React Router', 'TanStack Start', 'Astro', 'Nuxt', 'Vue']}>
  <Tab>
    {/* Next.js */}

    ### Encryption key required when passing `secretKey` at runtime

    When passing `secretKey` as a runtime option to `clerkMiddleware()`, you must now also provide a `CLERK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable.

    Add the encryption key to your environment:

    ```env
    CLERK_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key
    ```

    More information: [clerkMiddleware documentation](/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware#dynamic-keys)

    ### ClerkProvider should be inside `<body>` for Next.js 16 cache components

    For Next.js 16 cache components support (`cacheComponents: true`), `ClerkProvider` must be positioned inside `<body>` rather than wrapping `<html>`. This prevents "Uncached data was accessed outside of `<Suspense>`" errors.

    ```diff
    - <ClerkProvider>
    -   <html lang="en">
    -     <body>{children}</body>
    -   </html>
    - </ClerkProvider>
    + <html lang="en">
    +   <body>
    +     <ClerkProvider>
    +       {children}
    +     </ClerkProvider>
    +   </body>
    + </html>
    ```

    If you're using Next.js 16 with `cacheComponents: true`, you may also need to wrap `ClerkProvider` in a `<Suspense>` boundary.

    Update your imports:

    ```diff
    - import { ClerkProvider, useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-expo';
    + import { ClerkProvider, useUser } from '@clerk/expo';
    ```

    And update your `package.json`:

    ```diff
    - "@clerk/clerk-expo": "^2.0.0",
    + "@clerk/expo": "^3.0.0",
    ```

    ### `Clerk` export removed

    The `Clerk` export has been removed from `@clerk/expo`. Use `useClerk()` hook instead:

    ```diff
    - import { Clerk } from '@clerk/expo';
    + import { useClerk } from '@clerk/expo';

    - Clerk.signOut();
    + const { signOut } = useClerk();

    ### `getAuth()` helper removed

    The `getAuth()` helper has been removed. Use `auth()` instead:

    ```diff
    - import { getAuth } from '@clerk/nuxt/server';
    + import { auth } from '@clerk/nuxt/server';

    - const { userId } = getAuth(event);
    + const { userId } = auth();
    ```

    ### Routing strategy now defaults to `path`

    The default routing strategy for Nuxt has changed from `hash` to `path`. If you were relying on hash-based routing, explicitly set the strategy:

    ```ts
    // nuxt.config.ts
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      clerk: {
        routingStrategy: 'hash', // Restore previous behavior
      },
    })
