{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/api/endpoints/InvitationApi.ts#L34 */}

Retrieves a list of non-revoked invitations for your application, sorted by descending creation date. Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) object with a `data` property that contains an array of [`Invitation`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-invitation) objects, and a `totalCount` property that indicates the total number of invitations in the system.

```ts
function getInvitationList(
  params: GetInvitationListParams,
): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<Invitation[]>>
```

## `GetInvitationListParams`

<Properties>
  - `status?`
  - `accepted | pending | revoked`

  Filter by invitation status.

  ---

  - `limit?`
  - `number`

  The number of results to return. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than 501. Can be used for paginating the results together with `offset`. Defaults to `10`.

  ---

  - `offset?`
  - `number`

  Skip the first `offset` results when paginating. Needs to be an integer greater or equal to zero. To be used in conjunction with `limit`. Defaults to `0`.
</Properties>

## Examples

```

### Filter by invitation status

```

### Limit the number of results

Retrieves list of invitations that have been revoked that is filtered by the number of results.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.invitations.getInvitationList({
  status: 'revoked',
  // returns the first 10 results
  limit: 10,
})
```

### Skip results

Retrieves list of invitations that have been revoked that is filtered by the number of results to skip.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.invitations.getInvitationList({
  status: 'revoked',
  // skips the first 10 results
  offset: 10,
})
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/invitations`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Invitations#operation/ListInvitations){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
