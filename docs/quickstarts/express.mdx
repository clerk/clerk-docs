Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Express backend for secure user authentication and management. This guide uses TypeScript and allows you to choose your frontend framework.

<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/express`

  Clerk's [Express SDK](/docs/references/express/overview) ships with a variety of helpers for the backend to make user authentication easier.

  To get started using Clerk with Express, add the SDK to your project:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/express
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/express
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/express
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env.local` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
    1. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
    1. Paste your keys into your `.env.local` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```sh {{ filename: '.env.local' }}
  CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  This guide uses `dotenv` to load the environment variables. Install the package by running the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install dotenv
    npm install -D @types/dotenv
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add dotenv
    yarn add -D @types/dotenv
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add dotenv
    pnpm add -D @types/dotenv
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Add middleware to your application

  The [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/references/express/overview#clerk-middleware) helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Express application. It can be registered globally or for specific routes. The following example registers it globally.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts', mark: [3, 8] }}
  import 'dotenv/config'
  import express from 'express'
  import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

  const app = express()
  const PORT = 3000

  app.use(clerkMiddleware())

  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`)
  })
  ```

  ### Accessing auth state using `getAuth()`

  The [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/express/overview#get-auth) helper retrieves authentication state from the request object.

  [`clerkClient`](/docs/references/express/overview#clerk-client) is an instance of Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK, which provides access to Clerk's Backend API resources and low-level authentication utilities for JavaScript environments.

  The following example uses `getAuth()` to retrieve the `userId`, which is used to protect the route and is passed to `clerkClient.users.getUser()` to retrieve the current user's `User` object.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you would rather use middleware to protect routes, check out [`requireAuth`](/docs/references/express/overview#require-auth).

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts', mark: [3, [10, 19]] }}
  import 'dotenv/config'
  import express from 'express'
  import { clerkClient, clerkMiddleware, getAuth } from '@clerk/express'

  const app = express()
  const PORT = 3000

  app.use(clerkMiddleware())

  app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
    const { userId } = getAuth(req)

    if (!userId) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' })
    }

    const user = await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId)

    return res.json({ user })
  })

  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`)
  })
  ```
