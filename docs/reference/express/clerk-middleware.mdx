sdk: expressjs
---

The `clerkMiddleware()` function checks the request's cookies and headers for a session JWT and if found, attaches the [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object to the `request` object under the `auth` key. **It must be set before any other middleware.**

> [!TIP]
> Even if you are using [`requireAuth()`](/docs/reference/express/require-auth) middleware, you should still use `clerkMiddleware()` as it will provide authentication state to routes that don't use `requireAuth()`. See the [example](#example-use-clerk-middleware-require-auth-and-get-auth-together).

```js
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

const app = express()

// Pass no parameters
app.use(clerkMiddleware())

// Pass options
app.use(clerkMiddleware(options))
```

## Example: Use `clerkMiddleware()`, `requireAuth()`, and `getAuth()` together

The following example demonstrates how to use `clerkMiddleware()`, [`requireAuth()`](/docs/reference/express/require-auth), and [`getAuth()`](/docs/reference/express/get-auth) together. `clerkMiddleware()` will provide authentication state to routes that don't use `requireAuth()`, `requireAuth()` will provide authentication state to a route and also protect the route based on authentication status, and `getAuth()` can be used in a number of ways. In this example, `getAuth()` is used to protect the route based on authorization status.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware, getAuth, requireAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const PORT = 3000

// Apply `clerkMiddleware()` to all routes
app.use(clerkMiddleware())

// Use `getAuth()` to protect a route based on authorization status
const hasPermission = (req, res, next) => {
  const auth = getAuth(req)

  // Handle if the user is not authorized
  if (!auth.has({ permission: 'org:admin:example' })) {
    return res.status(403).send('Forbidden')
  }

  return next()
}

// Use `requireAuth()` to protect a route based on authentication status
// If user is not authenticated, requireAuth() will redirect back to the homepage
// Then, use the `hasPermission` function created above to protect the route based on authorization status
app.get('/path', requireAuth(), hasPermission, (req, res) => res.json(req.auth))

// This route is not protected but it will have authentication state
// attached to the request object because `clerkMiddleware()` was applied to all routes
app.get('/path2', (req, res) => res.json(req.auth))

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`)
})
```

### `clerkMiddleware()` options

<Include src="_partials/clerk-middleware-options" />

<Properties>
  - `clerkClient`
  - [`ClerkClient`](/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart#create-clerk-client-options)

  An instance of the `ClerkClient` class. This is used to interact with the Clerk API.

  ---

  - `debug`
  - `boolean`

  A flag to enable debug mode. When set to `true`, the middleware will log debug information to the console. Defaults to `false`.

  ---

  - `enableHandshake`
  - `boolean`

  A flag to enable Clerk's handshake flow, which helps verify the session state when a session JWT has expired. It issues a `307` redirect to refresh the session JWT if the user is still logged in. Defaults to `true`.

  ---

  - `frontendApiProxy?`
  - [`FrontendApiProxyOptions`](#frontend-api-proxy)

  Configure Frontend API proxy handling. When enabled, requests to the proxy path are forwarded to Clerk's Frontend API, and the `proxyUrl` is automatically derived for authentication handshake.
</Properties>

### Frontend API proxy

The `frontendApiProxy` option enables built-in proxying of Clerk Frontend API requests through your Express application. This is useful when direct communication with Clerk's API is blocked or needs to go through your application server.

When enabled, requests matching the proxy path (default: `/__clerk`) are intercepted and forwarded to Clerk's Frontend API before authentication runs. The `proxyUrl` for authentication handshake is automatically derived.

> [!NOTE]
> You must also [enable proxying](/docs/guides/dashboard/dns-domains/proxy-fapi#enable-proxying) in the Clerk Dashboard and configure the client-side proxy URL so that ClerkJS in the browser routes requests through the proxy.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()

// Enable proxy with defaults (path: '/__clerk')
app.use(clerkMiddleware({
  frontendApiProxy: {
    enabled: true,
  },
}))

// Or with a custom proxy path
app.use(clerkMiddleware({
  frontendApiProxy: {
    enabled: true,
    path: '/custom-clerk-proxy',
  },
}))
```

#### `FrontendApiProxyOptions`

<Properties>
  - `enabled`
  - `boolean`

  Enable Frontend API proxy handling. When `true`, requests to the proxy path are proxied to Clerk's Frontend API and the `proxyUrl` is auto-derived for authentication handshake.

  ---

  - `path?`
  - `string`

  The path prefix for proxy requests. Defaults to `'/__clerk'`. Must be unique and not conflict with other routes in your application.
</Properties>

#### `OrganizationSyncOptions`
