title: Use Clerk's MCP server
description: Connect AI agents to Clerk's MCP server to access SDK snippets and implementation patterns.
---

<Include src="_partials/mcp/mcp-beta-callout" />

Clerk provides a remote [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction){{ target: '_blank' }} server that allows AI agents like Claude, Cursor, and Github Copilot to access Clerk SDK snippets and implementation patterns. This provides AI agents with up-to-date code examples when developing with Clerk.

The Clerk MCP server provides:

- **SDK snippets**: Ready-to-use code patterns for common Clerk features.
- **Implementation guides**: Best practices for authentication flows, organizations, and more.
- **Framework-specific examples**: Patterns optimized for Next.js, React, and other supported frameworks.

## Setup instructions

To complete the integration, you'll need to connect your AI agent to Clerk's MCP server. Because each AI agent connects differently, select the appropriate tab below to see the specific setup instructions.
