```ts
const m2mToken = await clerkClient.m2m.createToken()
console.log(m2mToken)
```

While it is strongly recommended to use environment variables for security, if you need to pass in the machine secret key directly rather than using an environment variable, you can do so by passing it as an argument to the `createToken()` method, as shown in the following example:

```ts
const m2mToken = await clerkClient.m2m.createToken({
  machineSecretKey: 'ak_xxx',
})
console.log(m2mToken)
```
