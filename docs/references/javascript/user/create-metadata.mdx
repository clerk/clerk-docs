# Create user metadata

The [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user) object has methods that help you create data for the user, such as `createEmailAddress()` and `createPhoneNumber()`.

## `createEmailAddress()`

Adds an email address for the user. A new [`EmailAddress`][email-ref] will be created and associated with the user.

```typescript
function createEmailAddress: (params: CreateEmailAddressParams) => Promise<EmailAddress>;
```

### `CreateEmailAddressParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `email` | `string` | The value of the email address |

### `createEmailAddress()` returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <code>Promise\<[EmailAddress][email-ref]\></code> | The email address created for the user. |

## `createPhoneNumber()`

Adds a phone number for the user. A new [`PhoneNumber`][phone-ref] will be created and associated with the user.

```typescript
function createPhoneNumber: (params: CreatePhoneNumberParams) => Promise<PhoneNumber>;
```

### `CreatePhoneNumberParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `phoneNumber` | `string` | The value of the phone number, in [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format. |

### `createPhoneNumber()` returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <code>Promise\<[PhoneNumber][phone-ref]\></code> | The phone number created for the user. |

## `createWeb3Wallet()`

Adds a web3 wallet for the user. A new [`Web3Wallet<`][web3-ref] will be created and associated with the user.

```typescript
function createWeb3Wallet: (params: CreateWeb3WalletParams) => Promise<Web3Wallet>;
```

### `CreateWeb3WalletParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `web3Wallet` | `string` | In [Ethereum](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/common-terms.html#address-public-key), the address is made up of `0x + 40` hexadecimal characters |

### `createWeb3Wallet()` returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <code>Promise\<[Web3Wallet][web3-ref]\></code> | The web3 wallet created for the user. |

## `createExternalAccount()`

Adds an external account for the user. A new [`ExternalAccount`][exacc-ref] will be created and associated with the user.

```typescript
function createExternalAccount: (params: CreateExternalAccountParams) => Promise<ExternalAccount>;
```

### `CreateExternalAccountParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `strategy` | [`OAuthStrategy`](/docs/references/javascript/types/oauth-strategy) | The strategy corresponding to the oauth provider, e.g. `oauth_facebook`, `oauth_github`, etc |
| `redirectUrl?` | `string` | The URL to redirect back to one the oauth flow has completed successfully or unsuccessfully. |
| `additionalScopes?` | `string[]` | Any additional scopes you would like your user to be prompted to approve. |

### `createExternalAccount()` returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| <code>Promise\<[ExternalAccount][exacc-ref]\></code> | A `Promise` which resolves with the external account created for the user. |

The initial `state` of the returned `ExternalAccount` will be `unverified`. To initiate the connection with the external provider one should redirect to the `externalAccount.verification.externalVerificationRedirectURL` contained in the result of `createExternalAccount`.

Upon return, one can inspect within the `user.externalAccounts` the entry that corresponds to the requested strategy:

- If the connection was successful then `externalAccount.verification.status` should be `verified`
- If the connection was not successful, then the `externalAccount.verification.status` will not be `verified` and the `externalAccount.verification.error` will contain the error encountered so that you can present corresponding feedback to the user
