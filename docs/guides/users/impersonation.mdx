<Include src="_partials/feature-not-free-callout" />

Clerk's user impersonation feature allows you to sign in to your application as one of your users, enabling you to directly reproduce and remedy any issues they're experiencing. It's a helpful feature for customer support and debugging.

## Impersonate a user

The easiest way to impersonate a user is from the [**Users**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/users) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

To impersonate a user, on the right side of a user's row, select on the menu icon (three stacked dots). A dropdown menu will appear. When you select the **Impersonate user** option, your application instance should open in a new tab with the impersonated user signed in.

To add user impersonation functionality to your application, see the [custom flow for user impersonation](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/account-updates/user-impersonation).

## How user impersonation works

Clerk allows developers or admins of an application to sign in as different users. The feature involves two parts:

1. Get an actor token that can be used to sign in as a different user.
1. Detect an impersonated session as soon as you're signed in.

## Actor tokens

Actor tokens are similar to [sign-in tokens](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/sign-in-tokens/post/sign_in_tokens){{ target: '_blank' }}. They can be used for one-time sign-ins, but they result in impersonated sessions.

### Create an actor token

To create an actor token, you can use the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/actor-tokens/post/actor_tokens){{ target: '_blank' }}.

The following example demonstrates how to create an actor token by making a request directly to Clerk's Backend API using cURL. Using the generated token will result in user with ID `user_21Ufcy98STcA11s3QckIwtwHIES` (the actor/impersonator) signing in as user with ID `user_1o4qfak5AdI2qlXSXENGL05iei6` (the subject/impersonated).

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.clerk.com/v1/actor_tokens -d '{ \
  "user_id": "user_1o4qfak5AdI2qlXSXENGL05iei6", \
  "expires_in_seconds": 600 \
  "actor": { \
    "sub": "user_21Ufcy98STcA11s3QckIwtwHIES", \
  } \
}'
```

When creating actor tokens, the object that you pass as the `actor` parameter will end up in the authentication token's `act` claim. You can read more details in the [guide on session tokens](/docs/guides/sessions/session-tokens#default-claims).

### Revoke an actor token

To revoke an actor token, you can use the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/actor-tokens/post/actor_tokens/\{actor_token_id}/revoke){{ target: '_blank' }}.

Despite it's expiration date, you can revoke a token at any time. Revoked actor tokens can no longer be used for signing in.

The following example demonstrates how to revoke an actor token by making a request directly to Clerk's Backend API using cURL, even if it's not expired yet.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.clerk.com/v1/actor_tokens/act_2EL6mQKzeUtoRwGuLZsznyfkIsH/revoke
```

### Sign in with an actor token

Actor tokens are consumed the same way as sign in tokens.

Once you've successfully created an actor token, you can use the `url` attribute of the response to consume the token and impersonate a user.

The `url` attribute is a Clerk Frontend API URL that will use the token to sign out existing users and prepare the [`SignIn`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-in) object for impersonation. You can directly visit the `url` provided in the response to consume the actor token.

The [Frontend API](/docs/reference/frontend-api/){{ target: '_blank' }} will redirect you to the `/sign-in` page of your application, where the flow will continue by consuming the `__clerk_ticket` parameter.

## How to detect impersonated sessions

Once a user is signed in as a different user, Clerk provides APIs and helper methods to distinguish an impersonated session from a regular session.

Clerk also adds an `act` claim on the [Clerk session token](/docs/guides/sessions/session-tokens), which contains information like the impersonated session ID and the actor/impersonator's user ID.

> [!NOTE]
> When using a custom JWT template, the `{{session.actor}}` will need to be added as a claim in order to expose it.

### Detect impersonated sessions in the frontend

To detect impersonated sessions in the frontend, the `actor` object contains the `sub` claim of the impersonator. You can use this information to detect impersonated sessions.

<Tabs items={["Hook", "JavaScript"]}>
  <Tab>
    You can use the [`useAuth()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-auth) hook to get access to the authentication context, which includes the `actor` object.

    ```jsx
    const { userId, actor } = useAuth()

    return (
      <div>
        Server-side info:
        <p>
          {actor && (
            <span>
              User {actor.sub} has signed in as user {userId}
            </span>
          )}
        </p>
      </div>
    )
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    You can use the [`Clerk`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk) object to get access to the `session` object, which includes the `actor` object.

    ```js {{ filename: 'main.js' }}
    import { Clerk } from '@clerk/clerk-js'

    // Initialize Clerk with your Clerk Publishable Key
    const pubKey = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

    const clerk = new Clerk(pubKey)
    await clerk.load()

    const { session } = clerk

    if (session.actor) {
      const { actor, user } = session

      console.log(`User ${actor.sub} is signed in as user ${user.id}.`)
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

### Detect impersonated sessions in the backend

The [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object is a server-side object that contains the `actor` object, as well as important information like the current user's session ID and user ID. **Accessing the `Auth` object differs [depending on the SDK you're using](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#how-to-access-the-auth-object).** Here are some examples:

<Tabs items={["Next.js", "Astro", "Express", "React Router", "Tanstack React Start"]}>
  <Tab>
    The Next.js SDK provides the [`auth()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth) helper to App Router apps to access the `Auth` object.

    ```jsx
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default async function Page() {
      // Use `auth()` to access the `Auth` object
      const { actor, userId } = await auth()

      return (
        <div>
          {actor && (
            <span>
              user {actor.sub} has signed in as user {userId}
            </span>
          )}
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The Astro SDK provides the `locals.auth()` function to access the `Auth` object. [Learn more about using `locals.auth()`](/docs/astro/guides/users/reading#server-side).

    ```astro {{ filename: 'src/pages/example.astro' }}
    ---
    // Use `locals.auth()` to access the `Auth` object
    const { actor, userId } = Astro.locals.auth()
    ---

    <div>
      {
        actor && (
          <span>
            user {actor.sub} has signed in as user {userId || ''}
          </span>
        )
      }
    </div>
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The Express SDK provides a [middleware](/docs/reference/express/overview#clerk-middleware) that attaches the [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object to the `request` object.

    ```js
    import express from 'express'
    import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

    const app = express()
    // Apply the Express SDK middleware
    app.use(clerkMiddleware())

    app.get('/protected-endpoint', (req, res) => {
      // Clerk's authentication context can be accessed from the request object
      const { userId, actor } = req.auth

      res.json({ userId, actor })
    })

    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Booted.')
    })
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The React Router SDK provides the [`getAuth()`](/docs/reference/react-router/get-auth) function to access the `Auth` object.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/example.tsx' }}
    import { redirect } from 'react-router'
    import { clerkClient, getAuth } from '@clerk/react-router/server'
    import type { Route } from './+types/example'

    export async function loader(args: Route.LoaderArgs) {
      // Use `getAuth()` to access the `Auth` object
      const { isAuthenticated, actor, userId } = await getAuth(args)

      return {
        actor: actor,
        userId: userId || '',
      }
    }

    export default function Example({ loaderData }: Route.ComponentProps) {
      return (
        <div>
          {loaderData.actor && (
            <span>
              user {loaderData.actor.sub} has signed in as user {loaderData.userId}
            </span>
          )}
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The Tanstack React Start SDK provides the `auth()` function to access the `Auth` object. [Learn more about using `auth()`](/docs/tanstack-react-start/guides/users/reading#server-side).

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/routes/api/example.tsx' }}
    import { auth } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'

      server: {
        handlers: {
          GET: async () => {
            // Use `auth()` to access the `Auth` object
            const { actor, userId } = await auth()

            return json({ actor, userId })
          },
