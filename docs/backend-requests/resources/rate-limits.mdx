description: Learn about rate limiting on the Clerk APIs.

Clerk rate limits certain endpoints to help protect users against brute-force attacks or to stop abuse of Clerk's platform.

## Errors

If you receive a `429` error code, you have been rate limited. All subsequent requests to that specific endpoint will be blocked for a given amount of time.

Requests that have been rate limited will receive the `Retry-After` response header, which contains the number of seconds after which the block expires.

## Frontend API requests

Frontend API requests are rate-limited per user and identified by their IP address.

<Properties>
  - Create SignIn
  - `/v1/sign_ins`

  5 requests per 10 seconds

  ---

  - Create SignUp
  - `/v1/sign_ups`

  5 requests per 10 seconds

  ---

  - Attempt SignIn
  - `/v1/sign_ins/attempt_(first|second)_factor`

  3 requests per 10 seconds

  ---

  - Attempt SignUp
  - `/v1/sign_ups/attempt_verification`

  3 requests per 10 seconds
</Properties>

## Backend API requests

Backend API requests are rate-limited per application instance which is identified by the Secret Key that is provided when making Backend API requests.

<Properties>
  - Create users
  - `POST /v1/users`

  20 requests per 10 seconds

  ---

  - All other endpoints

  100 requests per 10 seconds

  ---

  - Get the JWKS of the instance
  - `GET /v1/jwks`

  No rate limit
</Properties>

> [!NOTE]
> The `currentUser()` helper uses the `GET /v1/users/me` endpoint, so it is subject to the 100 requests per 10 seconds rate limit.
