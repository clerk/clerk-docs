# ClerkJS

ClerkJS is our foundational JavaScript library for building user management and authentication. It enables you to register, sign in, verify and manage users for your application using highly customizable flows.

While we typically recommend using one of our framework bindings (such as [our React](/docs/quickstarts/react) or [Next.js bindings](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)), having the ability to use the underlying ClerkJS package provides more freedom to use Clerk how you best see fit.

## Installation

There are two ways you can include ClerkJS in your project. You can either [import the ClerkJS npm module](#install-clerk-js-as-es-module) or [load ClerkJS with a script tag](#install-clerk-js-as-script).

> You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) before you can set up ClerkJS. For more information, check out our [Set up your application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) guide.

### Install ClerkJS as ES module

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/clerk-js
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add @clerk/clerk-js
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @clerk/clerk-js
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

Once you have installed the package, you will need to import the ClerkJS object constructor into your code and pass it your Clerk Publishable Key as a parameter. Then, you can call the `load()` method to initialize ClerkJS. For more information on the `load()` method and what options you can pass to it, check out the [reference documentation](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk#load).

<InjectKeys>

```js
import Clerk from '@clerk/clerk-js';

const clerkPublishableKey = {{pub_key}};
const clerk = new Clerk(clerkPublishableKey);
await clerk.load({
  // Set load options here...
});
```

</InjectKeys>

### Install ClerkJS as script

ClerkJS can be loaded from a `<script />` tag with the source from your **Frontend API URL**. You can find your **Frontend API URL** in the Clerk Dashboard on the **[API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)** page. Click on the **Advanced** dropdown to reveal the **Frontend API URL**.

Add the following script to your site's `<body>` element:

<Callout type="info">
  Calling the `load()` method initializes ClerkJS. For more information on the `load()` method and what options you can pass to it, check out the [reference documentation](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk#load).
</Callout>

<InjectKeys>

```html
<script>
  // Get this URL and Publishable Key from the Clerk Dashboard
  const clerkPublishableKey = {{pub_key}};
  const frontendApi = '[your-domain].clerk.accounts.dev';
  const version = '@latest'; // Set to appropriate version

  // Creates asynchronous script
  const script = document.createElement('script');
  script.setAttribute('data-clerk-frontend-api', frontendApi);
  script.setAttribute('data-clerk-publishable-key', clerkPublishableKey);
  script.async = true;
  script.src = `https://${frontendApi}/npm/@clerk/clerk-js${version}/dist/clerk.browser.js`;

  // Adds listener to initialize ClerkJS after it's loaded
  script.addEventListener('load', async function () {
    await window.Clerk.load({
      // Set load options here...
    });
  });
  document.body.appendChild(script);
</script>
```

</InjectKeys>

## Usage
