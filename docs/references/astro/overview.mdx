# Astro and Clerk

Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your Astro application. This documentation covers the capabilities and methods available from Clerk's Astro SDK.

## General Reference

### `Auth` object

Both `Astro.locals.auth()` returns an Auth object. This JavaScript object contains important information like session data, your user's ID, as well as their organization ID. Learn more about the Auth object [here](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object).

### `clerkMiddleware()`

The clerkMiddleware() helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Astro application through middleware. It allows you to integrate authorization into both the client and server of your application. You can learn more [here](/docs/references/astro/clerk-middleware).

## Migrating from the Astro community SDK
