The Account Portal in Clerk is a powerful feature that allows you to streamline the sign-in, sign-up, and profile management experience for your users, without having to build your own components or host your own pages. **To integrate the Account Portal with your application, check out the [setup guide](/docs/customization/account-portal/getting-started).**

## Why use the Account Portal?

The Account Portal provides the pages necessary for your users to sign-up, sign-in, and manage their accounts, all while maintaining seamless integration with your application. These pages are hosted on Clerk servers for you and they require minimal setup to get started. If you're looking for the fastest way to add authentication and user management to your application, then this is a great choice.

However, if you require more precise customization or prefer having your application self-contained, then you can use Clerk's fully customizable [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview), or you can [build your own custom user interface using Clerk's API](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

## How the Account Portal works

The Account Portal uses Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview), which are embedded into dedicated pages hosted on Clerk servers.

After a user has finished their flow in an Account Portal page, Clerk automatically redirects them back to your application along with the required authentication context. This way, users are automatically redirected to and from your application for a seamless experience.

For each application environment, Clerk provides pages for sign-up, sign-in, user profile, organization profile, and organization creation flow. **To integrate the Account Portal with your application, check out the [setup guide](/docs/customization/account-portal/getting-started).**

## Hosted pages

### Sign-in

The sign-in page hosts Clerk's prebuilt [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component, which renders a UI for signing in users. The functionality of the `<SignIn />` component is controlled by the instance settings you specify in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), such as [sign-up and sign-in options](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options) and [social connections](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview).

### Sign-up

The sign-up page hosts Clerk's prebuilt [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component, which renders a UI for signing up users. The functionality of the `<SignUp />` component is controlled by the instance settings you specify in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), such as [sign-up and sign-in options](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options) and [social connections](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview).
