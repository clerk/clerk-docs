Inviting users to your Clerk application allows you to onboard new users seamlessly by sending them a unique invitation link.

Once you create an invitation, Clerk sends an email to the invited user with a unique invitation link. When the user visits the invitation link, they will be redirected to Clerk's [Account Portal sign-up page](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview#sign-up) and **their email address will be automatically verified.** If you want to redirect the user to a specific page in your application, you can [specify a redirect URL when creating the invitation.](#redirect-url)

Invitations expire after a month. If the user clicks on an expired invitation, they will get redirected to the application's sign-up page and will have to go through the normal sign-up flow. Their email address will not be auto-verified.

> [!TIP]
> Invitations are only used to invite users to your application. The application will still be available to everyone even without an invitation. If you're looking to create an invitation-only application, please refer to Clerk's [restrictions](/docs/authentication/configuration/restrictions) options.

## Create an invitation

At the moment, invitations can only be created for for email addresses and can only be created via the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Invitations#operation/CreateInvitation){{ target: '_blank' }}.

You can either use a cURL command or Clerk's [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) to create an invitation. Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK is a wrapper around the Backend API that makes it easier to interact with the API. Use the following tabs to see examples for each method.

<Tabs items={["cURL", "Backend SDK"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example demonstrates how to create an invitation using cURL.

    <SignedIn>
      Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite. Your Clerk secret key is already injected into the code snippet.
    </SignedIn>

    <SignedOut>
      Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite and replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your Clerk secret key. You can find your secret key in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    </SignedOut>

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    curl https://api.clerk.com/v1/invitations -X POST -d '{"email_address": "email@example.com"}' -H "Authorization:Bearer {{secret}}" -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    To use the Backend SDK to create an invitation, see the [`createInvitation()` reference.](/docs/references/backend/invitations/create-invitation)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Check out [the Backend API reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Invitations#operation/CreateInvitation) to see an example of the response.

### Redirect URL

When you create an invitation, you can specify a `redirect_url` parameter. This parameter tells Clerk where to redirect the user when they visit the invitation link.

The following example demonstrates how to use cURL to create an invitation with the `redirect_url` set to `https://www.example.com/accept-invitation`:

```bash
curl https://api.clerk.com/v1/invitations -X POST -d '{"email_address": "email@example.com", "redirect_url": "https://www.example.com/accept-invitation"}' -H "Authorization:Bearer {{secret}}" -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
```

Once the user visits the invitation link, they will be redirected to the page you specified, which means you must handle the sign-up flow in your code for that page. You can either embed Clerk's [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component on that page, or if the prebuilt component doesn't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can build a [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/invitations).

> [!TIP]
> For testing redirect URL's in your development environment, you can pass your port (`http://localhost:3000`). If you would like to use Clerk's Account Portal, you can pass your Clerk Frontend API URL as the base URL. For example, `https://prepared-phoenix-98.clerk.accounts.dev/sign-up` would send the user to the Account Portal sign-up page. You can find your Frontend API URL in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page. On the left side, select **Show API URLs**.

### Invitation metadata

You can also add metadata to an invitation. Once the invited user signs up using the invitation link, the invitation metadata will end up in the user's `public_metadata`. You can find more information about user metadata in the [metadata](/docs/users/metadata) docs.

To add metadata to an invitation, you can use the `public_metadata` property when the invitation is created.

The following example demonstrates how to create an invitation with metadata using cURL.

<SignedIn>
  Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite, and the `public_metadata` with the metadata you want to add. Your secret key is already injected into the code snippet.
</SignedIn>

<SignedOut>
  Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite, and the `public_metadata` with the metadata you want to add. Replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your Clerk secret key. You can find your secret key in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
</SignedOut>

```bash
curl https://api.clerk.com/v1/invitations -X POST -d '{"email_address": "email@example.com", "public_metadata": {"age": "21"}}' -H "Authorization:Bearer {{secret}}" -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
```

## Revoking invitations

Revoking an invitation prevents the user from using the invitation link that was sent to them.

At the moment, you can only revoke invitations via the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Invitations#operation/RevokeInvitation){{ target: '_blank' }}.

You can either use a cURL command or Clerk's [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) to create an invitation. Use the following tabs to see examples for each method.

<Tabs items={["cURL", "Backend SDK"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example demonstrates how to revoke an invitation using cURL.

    <SignedIn>
      Replace the `<invitation_id>` with the ID of the invitation you want to revoke. Your secret key is already injected into the code snippet.
    </SignedIn>

    <SignedOut>
      Replace the `<invitation_id>` with the ID of the invitation you want to revoke and replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your Clerk secret key. You can find your secret key in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    </SignedOut>

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    curl https://api.clerk.com/v1/invitations/<invitation_id>/revoke -X POST -H "Authorization:Bearer {{secret}}" -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    To use the Backend SDK to revoke an invitation, see the [`revokeInvitation()`](/docs/references/backend/invitations/revoke-invitation) reference documentation.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

> [!WARNING]
> Revoking an invitation does **not** prevent the user from signing up on their own. If you're looking for invitation-only applications, please refer to our [allowlist feature](/docs/authentication/configuration/restrictions#allowlist).

## Custom flow

Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) and [Account Portal pages](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview) handle the sign-up flow for you, including the invitation flow. If you want to build a **custom** sign-up flow, see the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/invitations) guide.
