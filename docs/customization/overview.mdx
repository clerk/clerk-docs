title: '`Appearance` prop'
description: Utilize Clerk's appearance property in order to share styles across every component or individually to any of the Clerk components.
---

{/* JS file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/types/src/appearance.ts#L619 */}

Customizing the appearance of Clerk components is a powerful way to make your application look and feel unique. Clerk provides a way to customize the appearance of its components using the `appearance` prop.

The `appearance` prop can be applied to [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) to share styles across every component, or individually to any of the Clerk components.

This applies to all of the React-based packages, like [Next.js](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs), as well as [the pure JavaScript ClerkJS package](/docs/references/javascript/overview).

## Properties

The `appearance` prop accepts the following properties:

<Properties>
  - `baseTheme?`
  - `BaseTheme | BaseTheme[]`

  A theme used as the base theme for the components. For more information, see [Themes](/docs/customization/themes).

  ---

  - `layout?`
  - `Layout`

  Configuration options that affect the layout of the components, allowing customizations that are hard to implement with just CSS. For more information, see [Layout](/docs/customization/layout).

  ---

  - `variables?`
  - `Variables`

  General theme overrides. This styles will be merged with our base theme. Can override global styles like colors, fonts, etc. For more information, see [Variables](/docs/customization/variables).

  ---

  - `elements?`
  - `Elements`

  Fine-grained theme overrides. Useful when you want to style specific elements or elements that are under a specific state. For more information, see the [Customize elements of a Clerk component](#customize-elements-of-a-clerk-component) section.
</Properties>

## Using a prebuilt theme

Clerk offers a set of prebuilt themes that can be used to quickly style Clerk components. See the [Themes](/docs/customization/themes) docs for more information.

## Customize the layout

The `layout` property is used to adjust the layout of Clerk's [`<SignIn/>`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) and [`<SignUp/>`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) components, as well as set important links to your support, terms, and privacy pages. See the [Layout](/docs/customization/layout) docs for more information.

## Customize the base theme

The `variables` property is used to adjust the general styles of a component's base theme, like colors, backgrounds, and typography. See the [Variables](/docs/customization/variables) docs for more information.

## Customize elements of a Clerk component

If you want full control over the appearance of a Clerk component, you can target the underlying elements by using their CSS classes and then apply your own styles.

First, you need to identify the underlying element of the Clerk component you want to style. You can do this by **inspecting** the HTML of the component.

For example, if you want to style the primary button in a Clerk component, you can right-click on the primary button and select "Inspect" from the menu. This will open the browser's developer tools and highlight the element in the HTML, as shown in the following image:

![The inspect element tab opened with an element selected. It shows a list of classes and a lock icon in between human-readible classnames and randomly generated ones](/docs/images/customization/identifying_elements.png)

When you select an element that is part of a Clerk component, you'll notice a list of classes like so:

```html
cl-formButtonPrimary cl-button üîíÔ∏è cl-internal-1ta0xpz
```

Any of the classes listed before the lock icon (üîíÔ∏è) are safe to rely on, such as `cl-formButtonPrimary` or `cl-button` from the previous example. You'll use these classes to target the necessary elements of the Clerk component.

> [!NOTE]
> Anything after the lock icon (üîíÔ∏è) are internal classes used for Clerk's internal styling and should not be modified.

Once you have identified the classes of the element you want to target, there are many ways to apply your custom styles depending on your preference:

1. [Use global CSS styling](#use-global-css-to-style-clerk-components)
1. [Pass custom CSS classes](#use-custom-css-classes-to-style-clerk-components)
   - [Using Tailwind](#use-tailwind-classes-to-style-clerk-components)
   - [Using CSS modules](#use-css-modules-to-style-clerk-components)
1. [Pass inline CSS to your Clerk options](#use-inline-css-objects-to-style-clerk-components)

### Use global CSS to style Clerk components

You can style the elements of a Clerk component with global CSS.

For this example, say you want to style the primary button in a Clerk component. You inspect the primary button to find the classes that you can use to target the element:

```html
cl-formButtonPrimary cl-button üîíÔ∏è cl-internal-1ta0xpz
```

You can then create a global CSS file, use the classes you identified to target the primary button, and apply your custom styles. In this case, `cl-formButtonPrimary` is the class you want to use because it's specific to the primary button:

```css {{ filename: 'styles/global.css' }}
.cl-formButtonPrimary {
  font-size: 14px;
  text-transform: none;
  background-color: #611bbd;
}

.cl-formButtonPrimary:hover,
.cl-formButtonPrimary:focus,
.cl-formButtonPrimary:active {
  background-color: #49247a;
}
```

### Use custom CSS classes to style Clerk components

You can pass additional classes to Clerk component elements by using the `elements` property on the `appearance` prop.

For example, an element in a Clerk component will have classes that look something like this:

```html
cl-formButtonPrimary cl-button üîíÔ∏è cl-internal-1ta0xpz
```

Remove the `cl-` prefix from a class and use it as the key for a new object in the `elements` property. The value of this object should be the string of classes you want to apply to the element.

The following example shows how to style the primary button in a `<SignIn />` component with custom CSS classes:

<Tabs items={["Next.js"]}>
  <Tab>
    <CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx', mark: [[8, 14]] }}
      import { ClerkProvider, SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
        return (
          <ClerkProvider>
            <html lang="en">
              <body>
                <SignIn
                  appearance={{
                    elements: {
                      formButtonPrimary: 'your-org-button org-red-button',
                    },
                  }}
                />
              </body>
            </html>
          </ClerkProvider>
        )
      }
      ```

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app.tsx', mark: [[7, 13]] }}
      import { ClerkProvider, SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'
      import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

      function MyApp({ pageProps }: AppProps) {
        return (
          <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
            <SignIn
              appearance={{
                elements: {
                  formButtonPrimary: 'your-org-button org-red-button',
                },
              }}
            />
          </ClerkProvider>
        )
      }

      export default MyApp
      ```
    </CodeBlockTabs>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Use Tailwind classes to style Clerk components

You can style the elements of a Clerk component with Tailwind.

The following example shows how to style the primary button in a `<SignIn />` component with Tailwind classes:

<Tabs items={["Next.js"]}>
  <Tab>
    <CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx', mark: [[8, 14]] }}
      import { ClerkProvider, SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
        return (
          <ClerkProvider>
            <html lang="en">
              <body>
                <SignIn
                  appearance={{
                    elements: {
                      formButtonPrimary: 'bg-slate-500 hover:bg-slate-400 text-sm',
                    },
                  }}
                />
              </body>
            </html>
          </ClerkProvider>
        )
      }
      ```

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app.tsx', mark: [[7, 13]] }}
      import { ClerkProvider, SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'
      import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

      function MyApp({ pageProps }: AppProps) {
        return (
          <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
            <SignIn
              appearance={{
                elements: {
                  formButtonPrimary: 'bg-slate-500 hover:bg-slate-400 text-sm',
                },
              }}
            />
          </ClerkProvider>
        )
      }

      export default MyApp
      ```
    </CodeBlockTabs>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Use CSS modules to style Clerk components

CSS modules are a great way to scope your CSS to a specific component.

Create your module file and add the CSS you want to apply, as shown in the following example for the `<SignIn />` component:

```css {{ filename: 'styles/SignIn.module.css' }}
.primaryColor {
  background-color: bisque;
  color: black;
}
```

Then you can apply this by importing the file and using the classes whenever required:

<Tabs items={["Next.js"]}>
  <Tab>
    <CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx', mark: [[9, 15]] }}
      import styles from '../styles/SignIn.module.css'
      import { ClerkProvider, SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
        return (
          <ClerkProvider>
            <html lang="en">
              <body>
                <SignIn
                  appearance={{
                    elements: {
                      formButtonPrimary: styles.primaryColor,
                    },
                  }}
                />
              </body>
            </html>
          </ClerkProvider>
        )
      }
      ```

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app.tsx', mark: [[8, 14]] }}
      import styles from '../styles/SignIn.module.css'
      import { ClerkProvider, SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'
      import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

      function MyApp({ pageProps }: AppProps) {
        return (
          <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
            <SignIn
              appearance={{
                elements: {
                  formButtonPrimary: styles.primaryColor,
                },
              }}
            />
          </ClerkProvider>
        )
      }

      export default MyApp
      ```
    </CodeBlockTabs>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Use inline CSS objects to style Clerk components

You can style the elements of a Clerk component with inline CSS objects.

The following example shows how to style the primary button in a `<SignIn />` component with an inline CSS object:

<Tabs items={["Next.js"]}>
  <Tab>
    <CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx', mark: [[9, 22]] }}
      import styles from '../styles/SignIn.module.css'
      import { ClerkProvider, SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
        return (
          <ClerkProvider>
            <html lang="en">
              <body>
                <SignIn
                  appearance={{
                    elements: {
                      formButtonPrimary: {
                        fontSize: 14,
                        textTransform: 'none',
                        backgroundColor: '#611BBD',
                        '&:hover, &:focus, &:active': {
                          backgroundColor: '#49247A',
                        },
                      },
                    },
                  }}
                />
              </body>
            </html>
          </ClerkProvider>
        )
      }
      ```

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app.tsx', mark: [[7, 20]] }}
      import { ClerkProvider, SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'
      import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

      function MyApp({ pageProps }: AppProps) {
        return (
          <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
            <SignIn
              appearance={{
                elements: {
                  formButtonPrimary: {
                    fontSize: 14,
                    textTransform: 'none',
                    backgroundColor: '#611BBD',
                    '&:hover, &:focus, &:active': {
                      backgroundColor: '#49247A',
                    },
                  },
                },
              }}
            />
          </ClerkProvider>
        )
      }

      export default MyApp
      ```
    </CodeBlockTabs>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
