# Reassign the **Creator** role

When a user creates a new organization, that user is automatically added as the organization's first member and assigned whichever role is that org's [**Creator** role](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#the-creator-role). By default, that role is `admin`.

You cannot delete an organization role if it is used as the organization **Creator** role. But, you *can* reassign the **Creator** role to any other role with the right permissions. For example, if you want to delete the `admin` role, you will have to assign another role as the **Creator** role.

The **Creator** role must *at least* have the following [System Permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#system-permissions):

- Manage members (`org:sys_memberships:manage`)
- Read members (`org:sys_memberships:read`)
- Delete organization (`org:sys_profile:delete`)

To reassign the **Creator** role:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=roles).
2. In the navigation sidebar, select **Organization Settings**.
3. Select the **Roles** tab. [Create a new role](/docs/organizations/create-roles-permissions#create-a-new-role-for-your-organization) or select an existing role from the list.
4. Select the **Show System Permissions** checkbox.
5. In the list of system permissions, ensure that **Manage members,** **Read members,** and **Delete organization** are selected.
6. At the top right of the screen, open the "..." menu.
7. From the dropdown, select the **Set as Creator role** option.
