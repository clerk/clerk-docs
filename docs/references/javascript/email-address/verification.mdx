# `EmailAddress` verification

These are all methods on the [`EmailAddress`](/docs/references/javascript/email-address/email-address) class that allow you to verify a user's email address.

## `prepareVerification()`

Kick off the verification process for this email address. An email message with a one-time code or an email-link will be sent to the email address box.

```typescript
function prepareVerification(params: PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<EmailAddress>;
```

### `PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `strategy` | `'email_link' \| 'email_code'` | The verification strategy.<br/>Possible strategy values are:<br/><ul><li>`email_link`: User will receive an email link via email.</li><li>`email_code`: User will receive a one-time authentication code via email.</li></ul> |
| `redirectUrl` | `string \| undefined` | The email link target URL. Users will be redirected here once they click the email link from their email. This param only applies if `strategy` is `email_link`. |

## `attemptVerification()`

Attempts to verify this email address, passing the one-time code that was sent as an email message. The code will be sent when calling the [EmailAddress.prepareVerification()](#prepare-verification) method.

```typescript
function attemptVerification(params: AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<EmailAddress>;
```

### `AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | `string` | The one-time code that was sent to the user's email address when [EmailAddress.prepareVerification()](#prepare-verification) was called with `strategy` set to `email_code`. |
