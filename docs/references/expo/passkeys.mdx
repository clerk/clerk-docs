This guide show's you how to authenticate with passkeys in your Expo application.

> [!WARNING]
> This API is available only for [@clerk/clerk-expo v2](/docs/upgrade-guides/expo-v2/upgrade) >=2.2.0.

<Steps>
  ### Enable passkeys

  To use passkeys, first enable the strategy in the Clerk Dashboard. If you haven't already visit the [Enable passkeys documentation section](https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/passkeys#enable-passkeys)

  ### Set your associated domains and your digital asset links files.

  In order to use passkeys you will need to navigate to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
  then go to `Native Applications` page. You can find that page under the `Configure` tab.

  <Tabs items={['iOS', 'Android']}>
    <Tab>
      > [!WARNING]
      > Ios Support passkeys from version iOS 16+

      To create your digital asset links file, in the form that appears you will need to provide `Bundle ID` and your `App ID Prefix`.

      // Put an image of the form
      // Put an image of the where we are copying the link that the associated domains are hosted

      After successfully submitting the above values the association file will be
      hosted at https\://${YOUR_APPS_FRONTEND_API_URL}/.well-known/apple-app-site-association.

      > [!NOTE]
      > You can view your ${YOUR_APPS_FRONTEND_API_URL} after submitting all value in the description of the card.
      > //TODO-AlexNti:ADD IMAGE HERE

      After successfully creating the associated domains file, update your app.json in you Expo application.

      ```json
      {
        "expo": {
          //...existing properties
          "plugins": [
            [
              "expo-build-properties",
              {
                "ios": {
                  "deploymentTarget": "16.0" //  Ios Support passkeys from version iOS 16+
                }
              }
            ]
          ],
          "ios": {
            //...existing properties
            "associatedDomains": ["applinks:${YOUR_DOMAIN}", "webcredentials:${YOUR_DOMAIN}"]
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      > [!WARNING]
      > Android supports passkeys from version Android 9+

      To create your digital asset links file, in the form that appears you will need to provide the `namespace `, `package name` and `sha256_cert_fingerprints`
      of your android app.

      - For namespace use the value of `android_app`.
      - For package name use the package name of your app.
      - Learn more about the `sha256_cert_fingerprints` and how to generate in the following links:
        - [Android app linking in official Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/linking/android-app-links/#create-assetlinksjson-file)
        - [Verify app linking in official Android docs](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks#web-assoc)

      > [!NOTE]
      > You can check that your `assetlinks.json` can be associated your app use [Statement List Generator and Tester](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/tools/generator)

      After successfully submitting the above values the `assetlinks.json` will be hosted at https\://${YOUR_APPS_FRONTEND_API_URL}/.well-known/assetlinks.json.

      > [!NOTE]
      > You can view your ${YOUR_APPS_FRONTEND_API_URL} after submitting all value in the description of the card.
      > //TODO-AlexNti:ADD IMAGE HERE

      Now that we set up the assetlinks.json we need to update the app.json file in our Expo application.

      ```json
      {
        "expo": {
          "android": {
            //...existing properties
            "intentFilters": [
              {
                "action": "VIEW",
                "autoVerify": true,
                "data": [
                  {
                    "scheme": "https",
                    "host": "${YOUR_APPS_FRONTEND_API_URL}"
                  }
                ],
                "category": ["BROWSABLE", "DEFAULT"]
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ### Install the necessary peer dependencies

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/expo-passkeys
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/expo-passkeys
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/expo-passkeys
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Add passkeys object your `<ClerkProvider>`

  ```tsx
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'
  import { passkeys } from '@clerk/clerk-expo/passkeys'

  return <ClerkProvider __experimental__passkeys={passkeys}>{/* Your app here */}</ClerkProvider>
  ```

  ### Create a passkey

  ```tsx
  const { user } = useUser()

  const handleCreatePasskey = async () => {
    if (!user) return
    try {
      return await user.createPasskey()
    } catch (e: any) {
      // handle error
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Authenticate a user with a passkey

  ```tsx
  const { signIn, setActive } = useSignIn()

  const handlePasskeySignIn = async () => {
    try {
      const signInResponse = await signIn.authenticateWithPasskey({ flow: 'discoverable' })
      await setActive({ session: signInResponse.createdSessionId })
    } catch (err: any) {
      // handle error
    }
  }
  ```
</Steps>
