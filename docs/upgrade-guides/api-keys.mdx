# Publishable and secret keys

> [!NOTE]
> If your application was created after January 18, 2023, you're already using publishable and secret keys.

In early Clerk SDKs, developers were required to configure three keys:

- Frontend API URL
- API key
- JWT key (depending on the SDK version)

New SDKs have replaced these with two keys:

- Publishable key (prefixed with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
- Secret key (prefixed with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)

The name and format of these keys are common among developer tools, and we adopted them to provide a more familiar developer experience.

Although legacy keys will remain operational, we have updated our documentation and code samples to use the new Publishable Key and Secret Key format.

> [!CAUTION]
> Legacy keys cannot be mixed with the new publishable and secret keys. It is important that you replace all keys at once.

We recommend updating at your earliest convenience.
