# `$signInStore`

The `$signInStore` store provides access to the [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-in. This is also useful for creating a custom sign-in flow.

## How to use the `$signInStore` store

### Check the current state of a sign-in with `$signInStore`

Use the `$signInStore` store to check the current state of a sign-in.

  ```tsx filename="sign-in-step.tsx"
  import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react';
  import { $signInStore } from '@clerk/astro/client';

  export default function SignInStep() {
    const signIn = useStore($signInStore);

    if (signIn === undefined) {
      // Add logic to handle loading state
      return null;
    }

    return <div>The current sign in attempt status is {signIn.status}.</div>;
  }
  ```

The `status` property of the `SignIn` object can be one of the following values:

| Values | Descriptiom |
| --- | --- |
| `complete` | The user has been signed in and custom flow can proceed to [`setActive()`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods) to create session. |
| `needs_first_factor` | The First Factor verification is missing. One of `email_link`, `email_code`, `phone_code`, `web3_metamask_signature` or `oauth_provider` is required to verify user. See [First Factor](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/first-factor) for details. |
| `needs_second_factor` | The Second Factor verification is missing. The Second Factor is an optional step to provide additional verification and includes `phone_code` and `totp`. See [Second Factor](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/second-factor) for details. |
| `needs_identifier` | The user's identifier (email address, phone number, username, etc.) hasn't been provided. |
| `needs_new_password` | The user needs to set a new password. |

### Create a custom sign-in flow with `$signInStore`

The `$signInStore` store can also be used to build fully custom sign-in flows, if Clerk's pre-built components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow. Different sign-in flows include email and password, email and phone codes, email links, and multifactor (MFA). To learn more about using the `$signInStore` store to create custom flows, check out the [custom flow guides](https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/overview).
