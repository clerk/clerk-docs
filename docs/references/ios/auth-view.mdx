![The AuthView renders a comprehensive authentication interface that handles both user sign-in and sign-up flows.](/docs/images/ui-components/ios-auth-view.png){{ style: { maxWidth: '460px' } }}

The `AuthView` renders a comprehensive authentication interface with support for multiple sign-up flows and sign-in methods, multi-factor authentication, password reset, and account recovery. The functionality of the `AuthView` is controlled by the instance settings you specify in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), such as [sign-in and sign-up options](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options) and [social connections](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `mode`
  - `AuthView.Mode`

  The authentication mode that determines which flows are available to the user. Accepts the following values:

  - `.signInOrUp`: Automatically determines whether to sign users in or sign them up based on whether they already have an account. This is the default mode that provides seamless authentication without requiring users to choose between sign-in and sign-up.
  - `.signIn`: Restricts the interface to sign-in flows only. Users can only authenticate with existing accounts.
  - `.signUp`: Restricts the interface to sign-up flows only. Users can only create new accounts.

  Defaults to `.signInOrUp`.

  ---

  - `isDismissable`
  - `Bool`

  Whether the view can be dismissed by the user. When `true`, a dismiss button appears and the view closes automatically after successful authentication. When `false`, no dismiss button is shown. Defaults to `true`.
</Properties>

## Usage

The following examples show how to use the `AuthView` component in your iOS app.

### Basic usage as a dismissable sheet

```swift
struct HomeView: View {
  @Environment(\.clerk) private var clerk
  @State private var authIsPresented = false

  var body: some View {
    ZStack {
      if clerk.user != nil {
        UserButton()
          .frame(width: 36, height: 36)
      } else {
        Button("Sign in") {
          authIsPresented = true
        }
      }
    }
    .sheet(isPresented: $authIsPresented) {
      AuthView()
    }
  }
}
```

### Full-screen authentication (non-dismissable)

```swift
struct ProfileView: View {
  @Environment(\.clerk) private var clerk

  var body: some View {
    if clerk.user != nil {
      UserProfileView(isDismissable: false)
    } else {
      AuthView(isDismissable: false)
    }
  }
}
```
