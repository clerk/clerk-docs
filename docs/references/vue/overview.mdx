The Clerk Vue SDK gives you access to prebuilt components, composables, and helpers to make user authentication easier. Refer to the [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/vue) to get started.

## Custom composables

The Vue SDK provides access to custom composables that include access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk) object, [`User` object](/docs/references/javascript/user), [`Organization` object](/docs/references/javascript/organization), and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up.

<Include src="_partials/vue-nuxt/composables" />

## Framework-specific SDKs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're building a standard Vue application (client-side only), use `@clerk/vue`. If you're using Nuxt, use the dedicated `@clerk/nuxt` package which includes backend integration.

Clerk offers framework-specific SDKs that are customized to provide the better developer experience and integration with each framework's features. Choose the appropriate SDK based on your framework:

| Framework | Package | Docs |
| - | - | - |
| Nuxt | `@clerk/nuxt` | [Nuxt SDK](/docs/references/nuxt/overview) |
