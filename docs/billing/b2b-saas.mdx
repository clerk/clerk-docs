description: Clerk Billing is a feature that allows you to create and manage Plans and Features for your application.

Clerk Billing for B2B SaaS allows you to create Plans and manage Subscriptions for companies or organizations in your application.

## Enable Billing

To enable Billing for your application, navigate to the [**Billing Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/settings) page in the Clerk Dashboard. This page will guide you through enabling Billing for your application.

## Create a Plan

Subscription Plans are what your customers subscribe to. There is no limit to the number of Plans you can create.

To create a Plan, navigate to the [**Plans**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/plans) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Here, you can create, edit, and delete Plans. To setup B2B billing, select the **Plans for Organizations** tab and click **Add Plan**. When creating a Plan, you can also create Features for the Plan; see the next section for more information.

> Plans appear in some Clerk components depending on what kind of Plan it is. All Plans can appear in the `<PricingTable />` component. If it's an Organization Plan, it can appear in the `<OrganizationProfile />` component. When creating or editing a Plan, if you'd like to hide it from appearing in Clerk components, you can toggle the **Publicly available** option off.

## Add Features to a Plan

Features make it easy to give entitlements to your Plans. You can add any number of Features to a Plan.

You can add a Feature to a Plan when you are creating a Plan. To add it after a Plan is created:

1. Navigate to the [**Plans**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/plans) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
1. Select the Plan you'd like to add a Feature to.
1. In the **Features** section, select **Add Feature**.

If it's an Organization Plan, it can appear in the `<OrganizationProfile />` component. When adding a Feature to a Plan, it will also automatically appear in the corresponding Plan. When creating or editing a Feature, if you'd like to hide it from appearing in Clerk components, you can toggle the **Publicly available** option off.

## Create a pricing page

You can create a pricing page by using the [`<PricingTable />`](/docs/components/pricing-table) component. This component displays a table of Plans and Features that customers can subscribe to. It's recommended to create a dedicated page, as shown in the following example.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/pricing/page.tsx' }}
import { PricingTable } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div style={{ maxWidth: '800px', margin: '0 auto', padding: '0 1rem' }}>
      <PricingTable />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Control access with Features, Plans, and Permissions

You can use Clerk's Features and Plans to gate access to the content. There are a few ways to do this, but the recommended and simplest way is either using the [`has()`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#has) method or the [`<Protect>`](/docs/components/protect) component.

The `has()` method is available for any JavaScript framework, while `<Protect>` is only available for React-based frameworks.

### Example: Using `has()`

Use the `has()` method to test if the organization has access to a **Plan**:

```jsx
const { has } = await auth()
const hasPremiumAccess = has({ plan: 'gold' })
```

Or a **Feature**:

```jsx
const { has } = await auth()
const hasPremiumAccess = has({ feature: 'widgets' })
```

The [`has()`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#has) method checks if the organization has been granted a specific type of access control (Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan) and returns a boolean value. It is available on the [`auth` object](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object) on the server. Depending on the framework you are using, you will access the `auth` object differently.

The following example accesses the `auth` object and the `has()` method using the [Next.js-specific `auth()` helper](/docs/references/nextjs/auth).

    The following example demonstrates how to use `has()` to check if an organization has a Plan.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default async function Page() {
      // Use `auth()` helper to access the `has()` method
      const { has } = await auth()

      // Use `has()` method to check if an organization has a Plan
      const hasBronzePlan = has({ plan: 'bronze' })

      if (!hasBronzePlan) return <h1>Only subscribers to the Bronze plan can access this content.</h1>

      return <h1>For Bronze subscribers only</h1>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The following example demonstrates how to use `has()` to check if an organization has a Feature.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default async function Page() {
      // Use `auth()` helper to access the `has()` method
      const { has } = await auth()

      // Use `has()` method to check if an organization has a Feature
      const hasPremiumAccess = has({ feature: 'premium_access' })

      if (!hasPremiumAccess)
        return <h1>Only subscribers with the Premium Access feature can access this content.</h1>

      return <h1>Our Exclusive Content</h1>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The following example demonstrates how to use `has()` to check if an organization has a Permission.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default async function Page() {
      // Use `auth()` helper to access the `has()` method
      const { has } = await auth()

      // Use `has()` method to check if organization has a Permission
      const hasPremiumAccessManage = has({ permission: 'premium_access:manage' })

      if (!hasPremiumAccessManage)
        return <h1>Only subscribers with the Premium Access Manage permission can access this content.</h1>

      return <h1>Our Exclusive Content</h1>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>  
</Tabs>

### Example: Using `<Protect>`

The [`<Protect>`](/docs/components/protect) component protects content or even entire routes by checking if the organization has been granted a specific type of access control (Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan). You can pass a `fallback` prop to `<Protect>` that will be rendered if the organization does not have the access control.

    The following example demonstrates how to use `<Protect>` to protect a page by checking if the organization has a Plan.

    ```tsx
    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          plan="bronze"
          fallback={<p>Only subscribers to the Bronze plan can access this content.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The following example demonstrates how to use `<Protect>` to protect a page by checking if the organization has a Feature.

    ```tsx
    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          feature="premium_access"
          fallback={<p>Only subscribers with the Premium Access feature can access this content.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The following example demonstrates how to use `<Protect>` to protect a page by checking if the organization has a Permission.

    ```tsx
    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          permission="premium_access:manage"
          fallback={<p>Only subscribers with the Premium Access Manage permission can access this content.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
