## How the Account Portal works

The Account Portal uses our Clerk components embedded on dedicated pages hosted for your application and users are automatically redirect to and from your application for a seamless authentication experience.

This is available out of box for all instances and you do not need to set up any dedicated paths or pages.

## Getting Started  

To use the Account Portal, simply:

- Install Clerk
- Add Clerk to your Application
- Protect your Pages

Depending on your choice of framework, you can redirect to them from your application using our NextJS [authMiddleware](https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/middleware), React [Control Components](https://clerk.com/docs/component-reference/redirect-to-sign-in) or [ClerkJS SDK](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/clerkjs/clerk).
