Thanks for being willing to contribute to our docs!

## Project setup

1.  Fork and clone the repo
2.  Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
3.  Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b pr/your-branch-name`

> Tip: Keep your `main` branch pointing at the original repository and make pull
> requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
>     git remote add upstream https://github.com/clerkdev/clerk-docs.git
>     git fetch upstream
>     git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main main
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `main` branch
> to use the upstream main branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you can make
> all of your pull request branches based on this `main` branch. Whenever you
> want to update your version of `main`, do a regular `git pull`.
