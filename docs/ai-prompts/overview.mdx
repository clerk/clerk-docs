Clerk's AI prompt library provides curated prompts to help you work more efficiently with AI-powered development tools. These prompts are designed to guide AI assistants in helping you implement Clerk authentication and user management features correctly.

## How to use these prompts

These prompts can be copied into your AI-powered IDE or development tool, or pasted into your chat with an AI assistant. Here are some examples of how to use them:

- In Cursor, add the prompt to your [project rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules).
- In GitHub Copilot, save the prompt to a file in your project and reference it using `#<filename>`.
- In Claude Code, include the prompt in your `CLAUDE.md` file.

## Available prompts

> [!NOTE]
