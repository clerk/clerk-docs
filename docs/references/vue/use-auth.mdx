## How to use the `useAuth()` composable

The following example demonstrates how to use the `useAuth()` composable to access the current auth state, like whether the user is signed in or not. It also includes a basic example for using the `getToken()` method to retrieve a session token for fetching data from an external resource.

```vue {{ filename: 'App.vue' }}
<script setup>
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/vue'

const { getToken, isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useAuth()

const fetchProtectedData = async () => {
  const token = await getToken.value()

  // Fetch data from an external API
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
  })

  return response.json()
}
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">Loading...</div>
  <div v-else-if="!isSignedIn">Sign in to view this page</div>
  <div v-else>
    <!-- Your protected content here -->
  </div>
</template>
```
