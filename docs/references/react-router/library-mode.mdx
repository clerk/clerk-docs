React Router can be used as a standalone library or as a framework. This guide assumes you have followed the [React quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/react) and explains how to add React Router **as a library**. To use React Router as a framework instead, see the [React Router quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/react-router).

<Steps>
  ## Install `react-router` and `@clerk/react-router`

  Run the following command to install both React Router and the Clerk React Router SDK:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install react-router @clerk/react-router
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add react-router @clerk/react-router
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add react-router @clerk/react-router
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun add react-router @clerk/react-router
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  > [!NOTE]
  > You will not need the Clerk Secret Key in React Router's library mode, as it should never be used on the client-side.

  <SignedIn>
    Add your Clerk Publishable Key to your `.env` file. This key can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of the Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable Key.
    1. Add your key to your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  ```

  ## Update `<ClerkProvider>`

  Update `<ClerkProvider>` to be imported from `@clerk/react-router` instead of `@clerk/clerk-react`.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [4, 18, 22] }}
  import { StrictMode } from 'react'
  import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
  import './index.css'
  import App from './App.tsx'
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/react-router'

  // Import your Publishable Key
  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
    throw new Error('Add your Clerk Publishable Key to the .env file')
  }

  createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <StrictMode>
      <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
        <App />
      </ClerkProvider>
    </StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

  ## Set up your preferred routing mode

  React Router supports three different routing strategies, or ["modes"](https://reactrouter.com/start/modes):

  - Declarative mode: Enables basic routing features like matching URLs to components, navigating around the app, and providing active states with APIs like `<Link>`, `useNavigate()`, and `useLocation()`.
  - Data mode: Adds data loading, actions, pending states and more with APIs like loader, action, and useFetcher.
  - Framework mode: Use React Router as a framework to build your entire app. To use React Router as a framework instead, see the [React Router quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/react-router).

  ### Declarative mode

  To use declarative mode, wrap your app in a `<BrowserRouter>`. To define your app's routes, add `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components. This example adds the `/` (home) route and renders the `<App />` component when the URL matches. Read more about routing in the [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/routing).

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [4, 18, 22] }}
  import { StrictMode } from 'react'
  import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
  import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router'
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/react-router'
  import './index.css'
  import App from './App.tsx'

  // Import your Publishable Key
  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
    throw new Error('Add your Clerk Publishable Key to the .env file')
  }

  createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <StrictMode>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<App />} />
          </Routes>
        </ClerkProvider>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </StrictMode>,
  )
  ```
