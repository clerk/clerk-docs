Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK exposes the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} resources and low-level authentication utilities for JavaScript environments.

## Installation

Follow the instructions in the [JavaScript Backend SDK quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) to add the JavaScript Backend SDK to your project.

## Resources

### Users

The user object represents a user that has successfully signed up to your application.

### Organizations

Organizations are used to group members under a common entity and provide shared access to resources.

### Billing

### Allowlist Identifiers

Allow-lists and Block-lists allow you to control who can sign up or sign in to your application, by restricting access based on the user's email address or phone number.

### Domains

Domains represent each instance's URLs and DNS setup.

### Sessions

The `Session` object is an abstraction over an HTTP session. It models the period of information exchange between a user and the server. Sessions are created when a user successfully goes through the sign in or sign up flows.

### Clients

The `Client` object tracks sessions, as well as the state of any sign in and sign up attempts, for a given device or software accessing your application, such as your web browser, native application, or Chrome Extension.

### Invitations

Invitations allow you to invite someone to sign up to your application, via email.

### Redirect Urls

Redirect URLs are whitelisted URLs that facilitate secure authentication flows in native applications (e.g. React Native, Expo). In these contexts, Clerk ensures that security-critical nonces are passed only to the whitelisted URLs.

### Email Addresses

A user can be associated with one or more email addresses, which allows them to be contacted via email.

### Phone numbers

A user can be associated with one or more phone numbers, which allows them to be contacted via SMS.

### SAML connections

A SAML Connection holds configuration data required for facilitating a SAML SSO flow between your Clerk Instance (SP) and a particular SAML IdP.

### Sign-in Tokens

Sign-in tokens are JWTs that can be used to sign in to an application without specifying any credentials. A sign-in token can be used at most once and they can be consumed from the Frontend API using the ticket strategy.

### Testing Tokens

Tokens meant for use by end-to-end test suites in requests to the Frontend API, so as to bypass bot detection measures.

### M2M Tokens

Machine to Machine Tokens are used to manage authentication between Machines.

### OAuth Applications

OAuth applications contain data for clients using Clerk as an OAuth2 identity provider.

## Authentication helpers

### `authenticateRequest()`

### `verifyToken()`

### `verifyWebhook()`
