If you're building an application and want to allow large language model (LLM) apps to securely access user data within your app, you'll need to set up a **Model Context Protocol** (MCP) service. MCP enables external tools like LLM-based apps to request user permission to access specific data from your service. Refer to the [dedicated MCP section](/docs/oauth/how-clerk-implements-oauth#building-a-model-context-protocol-service) for more information.

This guide demonstrates how to connect an MCP-compatible client (**LLM app**), like Cursor, to an MCP server built with Next.js. It assumes that you have already built an MCP server in your Next.js application with Clerk by following the guide on [building an MCP server with Next.js](/docs/references/nextjs/build-mcp-server).

## Connect your client LLM to your MCP server

Once your MCP server is set up, clients that support the latest MCP spec can now invoke the `get-clerk-user-data` tool to securely fetch user data from your app, assuming the request is authorized with a Clerk OAuth token. Refer to the [guide on verifying OAuth access tokens](/docs/oauth/verify-oauth-tokens) for more information.

To complete the integration, you'll need to connect an MCP-compatible client to your MCP server. Most LLM tools that support MCP can automatically detect your server, and many also allow you to register custom servers in a configuration file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before proceeding, ensure you have toggled on the **Dynamic client registration** option in the [**OAuth Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/oauth-applications) page.
> This setting allows MCP-compatible clients to automatically register themselves with your server during the OAuth flow.

### Example: Connecting Cursor to your MCP server

1. Start your MCP server by running `npm run dev`.
1. Navigate to **Cursor Settings**. To find this, open the **Command Palette** (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`) and search for **Cursor Settings**, or select the gear icon in the top right corner of the app.
1. In the sidenav, select **Tools & Integrations**. If you don't see this, you may need to update Cursor to the latest version.
1. Under **MCP Tools**, enable the listed custom MCP server via the toggle. Cursor should have automatically detected it.
1. Select the **Needs login** option when it loads. You'll be redirected to a Clerk OAuth consent screen to authorize Cursor to access your user data.
1. Select **Allow**. Once authorized, the tool `get_clerk_user_data` should be listed as enabled and you should see a green active status.
1. Start a new chat in [**Agent Mode**](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/agent) and prompt it to fetch your Clerk user data (e.g. "What is my Clerk user data?").
1. Select the **Run tool** option once it becomes available. The response will vary based on your prompt, but it should include key details from your Clerk profile, such as:

```yaml
User ID: <user-id>
Username: <username>
First Name: <first-name>
Last Name: <last-name>
Primary Email: <primary-email>
Secondary Email: <secondary-name>
2FA Enabled: No
Account Banned: No
Account Locked: No
Profile Image: <profile-image>
External Accounts: <external-account>
Organization Creation Enabled: Yes
Delete Self Enabled: Yes
```

You've now successfully connected your client (**Cursor**) to the MCP server and authenticated it using Clerk. Your LLM agent can securely access user data through the exposed tools in your server.
