title: Sign-up and sign-in options
description: Clerk provides various options for configuring a sign-up and sign-in flow.
---

Clerk provides multiple options for configuring a sign-up and sign-in flow for your application. This guide will walk you through each option.

You can modify your authentication options after your application has been created by navigating to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) and selecting any of the options under **User & Authentication** in the left sidenav.

## User & authentication

To configure the options available to users for authentication, navigate to the [**User & authentication**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/user-and-authentication) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

The easiest way to allow your users to create and manage their authentication options is to use the prebuilt [`<UserProfile>`](/docs/reference/components/user/user-profile) component. If you're building a custom user interface using the Clerk API, refer to the [custom flow guides](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview).

### Email

Users can authenticate with their email address using the following options:

- **Email verification code**: Users receive a one-time code to their email address to sign in.
- **Email verification link**: Users receive an email with a link to sign in. As a security measure, email links expire after 10 minutes to prevent the use of compromised or stale links.
  <If sdk="expo">
    > [!WARNING]
    > Expo does not support email links. You can request this feature on [Clerk's roadmap](https://feedback.clerk.com/).
  </If>
  - **Require the same device and browser**: Email links are required to be verified from the same device and browser on which the sign-up or sign-in was initiated. For example:
    - A user tries to sign in from their desktop browser.
    - They open the email link on their mobile phone to verify their email address.
    - The user's sign-in on the desktop browser **gets an error**, because the link was verified on a different device and browser.

### Phone

<Include src="_partials/feature-not-free-callout" />

Users can authenticate with their phone number and verify it with a one-time code.

SMS functionality is restricted to phone numbers from countries enabled on your [SMS allowlist](#sms-allowlist).

### SMS allowlist

SMS functionality, including SMS [OTPs](!otp), is restricted to phone numbers from countries that are enabled on your SMS allowlist. This can be useful for avoiding extraneous SMS fees from countries from which your app is not expected to attract traffic. **By default, only the US and Canada are enabled.**

Every instance starts off with a default set of enabled SMS country tiers. To tailor it to your needs:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SMS**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/customization/sms) page.
1. Select the **Settings** tab.
1. Enable or disable countries as needed.

If a country is disabled, then phone numbers starting with the corresponding country calling code:

- Cannot receive [OTPs](!otp) and a request to receive an OTP will be rejected with an error
- Cannot receive notifications for password or passkey modifications
- Cannot be used upon sign-up
- Cannot be added to an existing user profile

### Username

In this section, you can allow users to set their username. Usernames must be between 4 and 64 characters long and do not allow special characters (^$!.`#+~`), but this can be customized.

<Include src="_partials/username-character-callout" />

### Password

When **Password** is enabled, users provide a password to sign in.

Disabling **Password** will only affect new users. Existing users will still be able to sign in with their existing password.

### Passkeys

<Include src="_partials/feature-not-free-callout" />

A passkey is a type of sign-in credential that requires one user action, but uses two authentication factors:

1. A pin number or biometric data
1. A physical device

**Users can only create passkeys after signing up**, so you'll need to enable another authentication strategy for the sign-up process. After signing in, users can create a passkey.

<If sdk="android">
  When setting up passkeys with Android, there are a few additional steps to follow. [Learn more about passkeys for Android](/docs/reference/android/passkeys).
</If>

<If sdk="expo">
  When setting up passkeys with Expo, there are a few additional steps to follow. [Learn more about passkeys for Expo](/docs/reference/expo/passkeys).
</If>

#### Passkey limitations

- Passkeys are not currently available as an [MFA](#multi-factor-authentication) option.
- Not all devices and browsers are compatible with passkeys. Passkeys are built on WebAuthn technology and you should check [the Browser Compatibility docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API#browser_compatibility) for an up-to-date list.
- Passkey related APIs will not work with Expo.
- Your users can have a max of 10 passkeys per account.

#### Domain restrictions for passkeys

<Include src="_partials/authentication/passkeys-restriction" />

### User model

In this section, you can:

- Allow users to set their first and last name.
- Allow users to delete their accounts.

## SSO connections

SSO connections are a way to allow users to authenticate with their existing accounts from other services. For example, if a user already has an account with Google, they can sign in with their Google account instead of creating a new account with your application.

Clerk offers two different types of SSO connections:

- For all users, which are also known as OAuth connections, or social connections. Read more about [OAuth connections](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/overview).
- For specific domains and Organizations, which are also known as Enterprise SSO connections. Read more about [Enterprise SSO connections](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/overview).

To enable SSO connections, navigate to the [**Enterprise SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

## Web3 authentication

Clerk provides Web3 authentication with either [Base](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/web3/base), [MetaMask](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/web3/metamask), [Coinbase Wallet](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/web3/coinbase-wallet), or [OKX Wallet](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/web3/okx-wallet). As part of validating the accuracy of the returned Web3 account address, Clerk handles the signing of a message and verifying the signature. Because sign-in with Web3 uses the same abstraction as our other authentication factors, like passwords or email links, other Clerk features like multi-factor authentication and profile enrichment work for Web3 users out-of-the-box.

To enable Web3 authentication, navigate to the [**Web3**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/web3) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

## Multi-factor authentication

Clerk supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), also known as two-factor authentication (2FA). If a user enables MFA for their account, they are required to complete a second verification step during sign-in. This enhances security by enforcing two different types of verification. Many websites offer this as an optional step, giving users control over their own security.

MFA is not available on the new application screen, but it can be enabled in the Clerk Dashboard.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Multi-factor**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/multi-factor) page.
1. Toggle on the MFA strategies you would like to enable.

The following MFA strategies are currently available:

- **SMS verification code**
- **Authenticator application (also known as TOTP - Time-based One-time Password)**
- **Backup codes**

Enabling MFA allows users of your app to turn it on for their own accounts through their [User Profile](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/account-portal#user-profile) page. Enabling MFA does not automatically turn on MFA for all users.

<Include src="_partials/duo-authenticator-app-callout.mdx" />

If you're building a custom user interface instead of using the [Account Portal](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/account-portal) or [prebuilt components](/docs/reference/components/overview), you can use [elements](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/elements/examples/sign-in#multi-factor-authentication-mfa) or [the Clerk API](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-password-mfa) to build a custom sign-in flow that allows users to sign in with MFA.

### Reset a user's MFA

You can reset a user's MFA by deleting their MFA enrollments. This will remove all of their MFA methods and they will have to enroll in MFA again.

To reset a user's MFA:

1. At the top of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/), select **Users**.
1. Select the user from the list.
1. Select the **Reset MFA enrollments** button.

## Restrictions

Clerk provides a set of restriction options designed to provide you with enhanced control over who can gain access to your application. Restrictions can limit sign-ups or prevent accounts with specific identifiers, such as email addresses, phone numbers, and even entire domains, from accessing your application. [Learn more about restrictions](/docs/guides/secure/restricting-access).
