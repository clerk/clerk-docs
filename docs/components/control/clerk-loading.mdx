The `<ClerkLoading>` renders its children while Clerk is loading, and is helpful for showing a custom loading state.

## Usage

It's not recommended to wrap the entire app in the `<ClerkLoading>` component; instead, only wrap the components that need access to the `Clerk` object.

<Include src="_partials/control-components-with-expo" />
