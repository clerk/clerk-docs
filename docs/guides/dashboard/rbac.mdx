description: Clerk Dashboard's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions matrix
---

Clerk roles define access levels and permissions for organization members. They balance autonomy and security while protecting organizational resources. Use this matrix to compare dashboard roles and permissions.

## Overview

Each role has permissions that determine what members can do. When assigning roles to team members, consider:

- What resources does this team member need to access?
- What actions does this team member need to perform?
- What level of system configuration access is required?

The available roles are:

- **Owner** - Full access to everything, including organization member management and instance keys
- **Admin** - Manage applications, instances, billing, configuration, API keys, and instance keys; can impersonate users
- **Developer** - Manage restrictions, view API keys and billing, and manage configuration and API keys in development instances only; dev-only impersonation
- **Support** - Read-only configuration. Manage restrictions and impersonate users for troubleshooting
- **Viewer** - Read-only access to configuration; least-privileged role for basic dashboard visibility
