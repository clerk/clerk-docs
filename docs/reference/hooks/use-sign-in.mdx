title: useSignIn()
description: Access and manage the current user's sign-in state in your React application with Clerk's useSignIn() hook.
sdk: chrome-extension, expo, nextjs, react, react-router, tanstack-react-start
---

The `useSignIn()` hook provides access to the [`SignInFuture`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-in-future) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-in attempt and manage the sign-in flow. You can use this to create a [custom sign-in flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview#sign-in-flow).

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `signIn`
  - [`SignInFuture`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-in-future)

  The current active `SignInFuture` instance, for use in custom flows.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The `SignInFuture` instance referenced by `signIn` does not have a stable identity, and will change as the sign-in flow progresses. Make sure you provide it in dependency arrays when using hooks such as `useEffect`, `useCallback`, or `useMemo`.

  ---

  - `errors`
  - [`Errors`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/errors)

  The errors that occurred during the last API request.

  ---

  - `fetchStatus`
  - `'idle' | 'fetching'`

  The fetch status of the underlying `SignInFuture` resource.
</Properties>
