An **OAuth access token** is a randomly generated string or JSON Web Token (JWT) that is given to the [client](!oauth-client) by the **authorization service** if the OAuth process is completed successfully. The client can then send this token to the **resource service** to be allowed to access the relevant resources and data. Learn more about how [OAuth access tokens work](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/oauth/overview).
