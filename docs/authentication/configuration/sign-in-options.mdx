# Sign-in options

Clerk provides a large selection of options for managing your user's sign-in experience. Clerk makes it easy to customize the way signing in works in your application, whether your users will be authenticating with [Passwords](/docs/custom-flows/email-password), [Magic Links](/docs/custom-flows/magic-links), [One-time Passcodes](/docs/custom-flows/email-sms-otp), or through a [Social OAuth provider](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview).

<Callout type="info">
  For more information about the steps required for a user to sign in, see the [sign-in flow documentation](/docs/custom-flows/overview#sign-in-flow).
</Callout>

You can create your sign-in flow with Clerk's [Account Portal pages](/docs/account-portal/overview) or [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview). If you need more control over your flow, you can build your own by using [React hooks](/docs/custom-flows/use-sign-up) or by using the methods of the [`SignIn` object](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in).

## Getting started

When a new application is created, you will be presented with the following screen:

<Images 
width={1879}
height={1373}
src="/docs/images/setup-clerk/create-sign-in-comp.png"
alt="An interactive builder for customizing your <SignIn /> component, which includes choosing identifiers and social login options."
/>

From this menu, you can select the key sign-in information that your users will be providing. There are three main sections:

### Identifiers

Identifiers are how your application recognizes an individual user.

- Email address
- Phone number
- Username

### Authentication strategy

The authentication strategy refers to whether your application will rely on passwords or a passwordless method of authentication.

- [Password](/docs/custom-flows/email-password)
- Passwordless
  - [One-time password (OTP)](/docs/custom-flows/email-sms-otp) - To sign in, the user will receive a code to their email or phone.
  - [Magic Link](/docs/custom-flows/magic-links) - To sign in, the user will click a link sent to their email.

### Connected accounts

Connected accounts are third-party sources used to authenticate your users.

- [Social Login (OAuth)](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth)
- [Web3 authentication](/docs/users/web3)

Once you've selected the first methods you would like to try, click **Create Application**. If you're not sure about what you want to use, don't worry. You can change any of these settings from the Clerk Dashboard later on.

## Making changes

If your initial sign-in choices aren't working out or if you want to add more options for your users, you can make changes by navigating to the [User & Authentication](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication) section of the Clerk Dashboard.

## Sign-in examples

Lets take a look at a few of the different sign-in options and how they can be combined to fit your application's needs.

### Email address

Let's imagine that you want to require your users to sign up and sign in with their email. You want to make sure the email they provided is verified before they can sign in. After their email is verified, users can sign in via passwordless methods: by either clicking a link or entering a one-time code sent to their email.

<Steps>

### Allow users to sign in using their email

Ensure that **Email address** is enabled as an identifier. Navigate to the [Email, Phone, Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) tab under the **User & Authentication** section in the Clerk Dashboard. The toggle next to **Email address** should be on. If it's not, toggle it on and hit **Apply Changes**. Users can now sign up and sign in with their email.

height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-address.jpg"
alt="The 'Email, Phone, Username' tab with an arrow pointing to the toggle next to 'Email address', toggled on."
/>

### Configure **Email address** settings

Select the gear symbol next to **Email address** to open up the configuration settings.

height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-address-configuration.jpg"
alt="The 'Email, Phone, Username' tab with an arrow pointing to the gear icon next to 'Email address'."
/>

### Email verification

From there, you can check the boxes next to **Email verification link** and **Email verification code**. Having all of these options toggled on will require users to provide an email on sign-up, require them to verify their email, and will allow them to verify their email with either a link or a code sent to their email.

height={1398}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-address-verification-methods.jpg"
alt="The 'Email address' configuration settings with all options toggled on, and with a red outline around the 'Verification Methods' section."
/>

### Allow passwordless sign-in

In the **Authentication factors** section under [Email, Phone, Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username), toggle on **Email verification link** and **Email verification code**. This will allow users to sign in with either a link or a code sent to their email.

<Images 
width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-address-verification.jpg"
alt="The 'Authentication factors' section under 'Email, Phone, Username' tab with a red arrow pointing to the 'Email verification link' toggle and 'Email verification code, both toggled on. There is also a red arrow pointing to the 'Apply changes' button."
/>

### Finished!

Now, when a user signs up or signs in to your application, Clerk will send a verification link or code to the user's email.

You can make changes to the redirect behavior of both sign-in and sign-up flows by visiting the [Paths](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=paths) section of the Clerk Dashboard, or by passing in props if you are using Clerk's [custom components](/docs/components/overview).

</Steps>

### Phone + SMS Code

<Callout>
  Phone number identifiers and SMS verification are Premium features that are only available on some plans. For more information visit the [Plan & Billing](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=plan-billing) section of the Clerk Dashboard.
</Callout>

Let's imagine that your application is going to be exclusively used by people on their phones. You want to collect the user's phone number as the identifier, and you want the user to sign in to your app by entering a one-time code sent via SMS to the user's device.

<Steps>

### Allow users to sign in using their phone number

Ensure that **Phone number** is enabled as an identifier. Navigate to the [Email, Phone, Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) tab under the **User & Authentication** section in the Clerk Dashboard. The toggle next to **Phone number** should be on. If it's not, toggle it on and hit **Apply Changes**. Users can now sign up and sign in with their phone number.

<Images 
width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/phone-number.jpg"
alt="The 'Email, Phone, Username' tab with an arrow pointing to the toggle next to 'Phone number', toggled on."
/>

Note how the toggle for **Email address** is off, because in this example, your application is prioritizing a mobile-first approach.

### Configure **Phone number** settings

Select the gear symbol next to **Phone number** to open up the configuration settings. 

<Images 
width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/phone-number-configuration.jpg"
alt="The 'Email, Phone, Username' tab with an arrow pointing to the gear icon next to 'Phone number'."
/>

Because in this example, your application is mobile-first, you should have all of these options toggled on. Having all of these options toggled on will require users to provide a phone number on sign-up, require them to verify their phone number, and will allow them to verify their phone number with a code sent to their phone.

<Images 
width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/phone-number-configuration-settings.jpg"
alt="The 'Phone number' configuration settings with all options toggled on."
/>

### Allow users to sign in with an SMS code

In the **Authentication factors** section under [Email, Phone, Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username), toggle on **SMS verification code**. This will allows users to sign in with a code sent to their phone.

<Images 
width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/sms-verification.jpg"
alt="The 'Authentication factors' section under 'Email, Phone, Username' tab with a red arrow pointing to the 'SMS Verifcation Code' toggle, toggled on. There is also a red arrow pointing to the 'Apply changes' button."
/>

### Finished!

Now, when a user signs up or signs in to your application, Clerk will send a verification code to the user's phone.

You can make changes to the redirect behavior of both sign-in and sign-up flows by visiting the [Paths](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=paths) section of the Clerk Dashboard, or by passing in props if you are using Clerk's [custom components](/docs/components/overview).

</Steps>

### Social OAuth + Web3

Let's imagine that you want your users to sign in with Social OAuth or with a connected Web3 account.

<Steps>

### Disable email/password

Users won't need an email or password, so you can turn those off in the [Email, Phone, Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) tab under the **User & Authentication** section in the Clerk Dashboard.

<Images 
width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-phone-off.jpg"
alt="The 'Email, Phone, Username' tab with a red arrow pointing to the toggle next to 'Email address' and 'Phone number', both toggled off. There is also a red arrow pointing to the 'Apply changes' button."
/>

### Enable social connections

Navigate to the [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections) tab under the **User & Authentication** section in the Clerk Dashboard. 

Select the OAuth providers that will be used to authenticate your users. In this example, Google is selected.

<Images 
width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/social-connection-google.jpg"
alt="The 'Social Connections' tab under the 'User & Authentication' section with a red arrow pointing to the 'Google' toggle, which is toggled on."
/>

### Enable Web3

Navigate to the [Web3](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/web3) tab under the **User & Authentication** section in the Clerk Dashboard. Toggle on the Web3 provider.

<Images 
width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/web3.jpg"
alt="The 'Web3' tab under the 'User & Authentication' section with a red arrow pointing to the 'Metamask' toggle, which is toggled on."
/>

### Finished!

Now, when a user signs up or signs in to your application, users can do so with Google or Metamask. For more information on setting up different social providers, see the [Social Connections guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview).
