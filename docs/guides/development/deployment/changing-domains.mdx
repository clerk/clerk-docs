Learn how to change your Clerk production instance's domain or subdomain.

> [!WARNING]
> You cannot change the domain of the [development instance](/docs/guides/development/managing-environments#development-instance) of your Clerk application.

## Change domain

1. Update your production domain using either of the following options:
   - The [Clerk Dashboard](#update-your-domain-via-clerk-dashboard)
   - The [Backend API](#update-your-domain-via-backend-api)
1. Once you make the change to your domain, you will need to update the following:
   - Update DNS records.
   - Generate new SSL certificates.
   - [Update your Publishable Key](#update-your-publishable-key).
   - If using social connections, update the settings with your social connections so that the redirect URL they are using is correct.
   - If using JWT templates, update JWT issuer and JWKS Endpoint in external JWT SSO services.

### Update your domain via Clerk Dashboard

To update your **production** domain in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the navigation sidenav, select **[Domains](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/domains)**.
1. Scroll to find the **Change domain** setting.

### Update your domain via Backend API

To update your production domain using the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }}, you will need to make a POST request to the `change_domain` endpoint. You will need to provide your new domain in the request body.

1. Copy the following cURL command.

<SignedIn>
  2) Your Secret Key is required to authenticate the request. It is injected into the cURL command after `Authorization`. However, you can also find it on the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
</SignedIn>

<SignedOut>
  2. Your Secret Key is required to authenticate the request.
     - Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) and sign in.
     - In the navigation sidenav, select **API keys** to copy your Secret Key.
     - Paste your Secret Key into the cURL command after `Authorization`, replacing `sk_...`.
</SignedOut>

3. Replace `YOUR_PROD_URL` with your new production domain.

```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: {{secret}}' -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{
"home_url": "YOUR_PROD_URL"
}' 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/instance/change_domain'
```

For more information on how to update your instance settings using the Backend API, see the [Backend API reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/beta-features/patch/beta_features/instance_settings){{ target: '_blank' }}.

### Update your Publishable Key

After changing your domain, a new **Publishable Key** will be automatically generated for your application. You need to update your environment variables with this new key and redeploy your application. You can find your **Publishable Key** on the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> Failing to update your **Publishable Key** will result in Clerk failing to load.

## Set, change, or remove subdomain

To set, change, or remove a subdomain for your production instance:

1. Navigate to the [**Domains**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/domains) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
1. Scroll to the **Change subdomain** section where you can set, change, or remove your subdomain. This section will only appear if you have a subdomain configured for your instance.
