The Clerk Ruby SDK provides a Rack middleware to integrate Clerk into your Rack-based application.

<Steps>
  ## Install `clerk-sdk-ruby`

  <Include src="_partials/ruby/installation" />

  ## Configuration

  <Include src="_partials/ruby/configuration" />

  ## Add Clerk's Rack middleware

  Add the Clerk middleware to your Rack application by updating your `config.ru` file with the following code:

  ```ruby {{ filename: 'config.ru' }}
  require "rack"
  require "clerk/rack"

  require_relative "app"

  use Clerk::Rack::Middleware
  run App.new
  ```

  ## Access the `clerk` object

  Once you've added the middleware, you can access the `clerk` object in your actions and views. The `clerk` object provides access to the [Ruby SDK's available methods](/docs/reference/ruby/overview#available-methods).

  The following example demonstrates a simple Rack application that protects all routes. If the user is authenticated, it returns the user's first name and ID. If the user is not authenticated, it returns a `401` status code.

  ```ruby {{ filename: 'app.rb' }}
  require "erb"
  require "clerk"

  class App
    def call(env)
      clerk = env["clerk"]

      # Check if the user is authenticated
      user = clerk.user
      user ?
        [200, {"Content-Type" => "text/plain"}, ["Authenticated User: #{user.first_name} (#{user.id})"]]:
        [401, {"Content-Type" => "text/plain"}, ["Not Authenticated"]]
    end
  end
  ```
</Steps>

## Example: Reverification

The reverification feature provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to reverify their session before accessing sensitive routes.

There are two ways to handle reverification in a Rack application:

1. [In your middleware](#in-your-middleware)
1. [In your application logic](#in-your-application-logic)

### In your middleware

To handle reverification in your Rack middleware, use the `Clerk::Rack::Reverification` middleware. It accepts an optional [preset](/docs/reference/ruby/overview#reverification) parameter to customize the reverification requirements and an optional `routes` parameter to specify which routes should be protected.

In the following example, the reverification preset is set to `LAX` and reverification is required for all routes that match the `/*` pattern.

```ruby {{ filename: 'config.ru' }}
require "rack"
require "clerk/rack"

require_relative "app"

use Clerk::Rack::Middleware
# Reverification preset is set to `LAX`
use Clerk::Rack::Reverification,
  preset: Clerk::StepUp::Preset::LAX,
  routes: ["/*"]

run App.new
```

### In your application logic

To handle reverification in your app logic,

- Use the `clerk.user_needs_reverification?` method to check if the user needs to reverify their session, which accepts an optional [preset](/docs/reference/ruby/overview#reverification) parameter to customize the reverification requirements.
- Use the `clerk.user_reverification_rack_response` method to get the response.

The following example demonstrates a simple Rack application that requires authentication and reverification for all routes.

```ruby {{ filename: 'app.rb' }}
require "erb"
require "clerk"

STEP_UP_PRESET = Clerk::StepUp::Preset::LAX

class App
  def call(env)
    clerk = env["clerk"]

    # Check if the user needs to reverify their session
    if clerk.user_needs_reverification?(STEP_UP_PRESET)
      # Get the response
      return clerk.user_reverification_rack_response(STEP_UP_PRESET)
    end

    # Check if the user is authenticated
    user = clerk.user
    user ?
      [200, {"Content-Type" => "text/plain"}, ["Authenticated User: #{user.first_name} (#{user.id})"]]:
      [401, {"Content-Type" => "text/plain"}, ["Not Authenticated"]]
  end
end
```
