<Callout type="info">

- Clerk Elements is for [advanced use-cases](/docs/elements/overview#why-use-clerk-elements) that require a high-level of customization. The easiest way to implement Clerk is with our [all-in-one UI components](/docs/components/overview).

- Clerk Elements currently only works with Next.js and [Clerk Core 2](https://clerk.com/changelog/2024-04-19). As it gets closer to a stable release, support for additional frameworks will be added.

<Steps>

### Add a sign-up route

Create a new route in your Next.js application. The route needs to be an [optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments) so the sign-up flow can handled nested paths. Add the following snippet to `/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`:

```tsx filename="/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx"
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignUp from '@clerk/elements/sign-up'

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <SignUp.Root>
      [Sign Up Root]
    </SignUp.Root>
  )
}
```

You will use these two imports to build out the rest of the flow. `<SignUp.Root>` manages the sign-up state and handles connecting the components to Clerk's APIs.

### Add the start step

The Clerk authentication flows are made up of **steps**. Steps handle rendering the UI for each part of the flow. To allow users to create a sign-up attempt, the `start` step needs to be rendered. Use the `<SignUp.Step>` component to render this:

```tsx filename="/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx" {9-11}
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignUp from '@clerk/elements/sign-up'

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <SignUp.Root>
      <SignUp.Step name="start">
        <h1>Create an account</h1>
      </SignUp.Step>
    </SignUp.Root>
  )
}
```

### Add form fields

Make it functional by adding fields. For the sake of this guide, let's assume that your instance is configured to require a username and allow authentication with email codes, as well as with Google. You will use the Clerk Elements field components to render `identifier` and `username` fields, as well as the `<Connection>` component to render a button that allows users to sign up with Google.

```tsx filename="/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx" {12-28}
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignUp from '@clerk/elements/sign-up'

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <SignUp.Root>
      <SignUp.Step name="start">
        <h1>Create an account</h1>

        <Clerk.Connection name="google">
          Sign up with Google
        </Clerk.Connection>

        <Clerk.Field name="identifier">
          <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <Clerk.Field name="username">
          <Clerk.Label>Username</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <SignUp.Action submit>Sign up</SignUp.Action>
      </SignUp.Step>
    </SignUp.Root>
  )
}
```

`<Clerk.Field>` takes care of wiring up the input with the label element, and `<Clerk.FieldError>` will render any field-specific errors that get returned from the Clerk's API. You've also used the `<SignUp.Action>` component. This component provides common actions that are used throughout the flows. In this case, you're using the `submit` action to render a submit button for the start form.

### Accept additional fields

Should a user attempt to sign up via Google while a username is a required field, the `continue` step will be necessary to accept the username. The `<SignUp.Step>` component will display any additional required fields.

```tsx filename="/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx" {30-40}
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignUp from '@clerk/elements/sign-up'

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <SignUp.Root>
      <SignUp.Step name="start">
        <h1>Create an account</h1>

        <Clerk.Connection name="google">
          Sign up with Google
        </Clerk.Connection>

        <Clerk.Field name="identifier">
          <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <Clerk.Field name="username">
          <Clerk.Label>Username</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <SignUp.Action submit>Sign up</SignUp.Action>
      </SignUp.Step>
      <SignUp.Step name="continue">
        <h1>Fill in missing fields</h1>

        <Clerk.Field name="username">
          <Clerk.Label>Username</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <SignUp.Action submit>Continue</SignUp.Action>
      </SignUp.Step>
    </SignUp.Root>
  )
}
```

If your instance has additional required fields, you can add them the same way you added the `username` field to the continue step.

<Callout>
Under the hood, Clerk Elements will conditionally render the fields that are necessary to complete the sign up attempt, so there's no need to check the state of the sign up attempt yourself.
</Callout>

### Email and phone verification

Next up is email and phone verification. If your instance requires verification of either of these fields, you will need to render the verifications step. Inside of verifications, you can render the UI for each verification strategy. In this case, you'll render both the `email_code` and `phone_code` strategies.

```tsx filename="/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx" {41-63}
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignUp from '@clerk/elements/sign-up'

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <SignUp.Root>
      <SignUp.Step name="start">
        <h1>Create an account</h1>

        <Clerk.Connection name="google">
          Sign up with Google
        </Clerk.Connection>

        <Clerk.Field name="identifier">
          <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <Clerk.Field name="username">
          <Clerk.Label>Username</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <SignUp.Action submit>Sign up</SignUp.Action>
      </SignUp.Step>
      <SignUp.Step name="continue">
        <h1>Fill in missing fields</h1>

        <Clerk.Field name="username">
          <Clerk.Label>Username</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <SignUp.Action submit>Continue</SignUp.Action>
      </SignUp.Step>
      <SignUp.Step name="verifications">
        <SignUp.Strategy name="phone_code">
          <h1>Check your phone for an SMS</h1>

          <Clerk.Field name="code">
            <Clerk.Label>Phone Code</Clerk.Label>
            <Clerk.Input />
            <Clerk.FieldError />
          </Clerk.Field>

          <SignUp.Action submit>Verify</SignUp.Action>
        </SignUp.Strategy>
        <SignUp.Strategy name="email_code">
          <h1>Check your email</h1>

          <Clerk.Field name="code">
            <Clerk.Label>Email Code</Clerk.Label>
            <Clerk.Input />
            <Clerk.FieldError />
          </Clerk.Field>

          <SignUp.Action submit>Verify</SignUp.Action>
        </SignUp.Strategy>
      </SignUp.Step>
    </SignUp.Root>
  )
}
```
