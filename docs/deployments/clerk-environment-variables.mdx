# Clerk environment variables

You can use environment variables to configure how your Clerk app behaves, such as where users are redirected after signing out of their account, or whether or not Clerk's telemetry should be enabled.

This page is a reference for all available Clerk environment variables.

## Compatibility

In the frontend, Clerk's environment variables work for most popular meta-frameworks, such as Next.js or Remix.

If you're building a pure React app, you should use the props on the components you're using. For example, to force users to redirect to a specific URL after signing in, you would use the `signInForceRedirectUrl` prop on [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) rather than the `CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL` environment variable.

## Sign-in and sign-up redirects

Components, such as [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider), [`<UserButton>`](/docs/components/user/user-button), and more, provide props for you to specify where users will be redirected. You should use environment variables instead of these props whenever possible.

    | - | - |

## Clerk publishable and secret keys

To access your Clerk app in your local project, you must specify your app's publishable keys for use in the frontend, and secret keys for use in the backend.

You can find these keys in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.

  <Tab>
    | Variable | Description |
    | - | - |
    | `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Your Clerk app's publishable key. It will be prefixed with `pk_test_` in development instances and `pk_live_` in production instances. |
    | `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Your Clerk app's secret key, which you can find in the Clerk dashboard. It will be prefixed with `sk_test_` in development instances and `sk_live_` in production instances. **Do not expose this on the frontend with a public environment variable**. |
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    | Variable | Description |
    | - | - |
    | `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Your Clerk app's publishable key, which you can find in the Clerk dashboard. It will be prefixed with `pk_test_` in development instances and `pk_live_` in production instances. |
    | `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Your Clerk app's secret key, which you can find in the Clerk dashboard. It will be prefixed with `sk_test_` in development instances and `sk_live_` in production instances. **Do not expose this on the frontend with a public environment variable**. |
