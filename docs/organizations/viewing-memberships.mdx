# View current organization memberships

Clerk provides the ability for the currently signed-in user to view all the organizations they are members of.

In React and Next.js applications, the [`useOrganizationList()`](/docs/references/react/use-organization-list) hook can be used to return the list of invitations or memberships for the currently active user. In JavaScript applications, the [`getOrganizationMemberships()`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user#get-organization-memberships) method is used to retrieve the list of organizations the current user is a part of and can be accessed through the [`User` object](/docs/references/javascript/user/user).

{/* TODO (DOCS-316): Add a section about viewing all memberships for an organization.

In addition to viewing the current users memberships, you can also view all of the memberships for an organization.

You can use the `getOrganizationMembershipList()` method to retrieve a list of memberships for an organization by passing in an organization ID. This method can be accessed through the [Backend API](/docs/references/backend/organization/get-organization-membership-list). */}

## Usage

{/* TODO (DOCS-316): Update and validate these code examples. Should have Nextjs App Router and JavaScript only. */}
