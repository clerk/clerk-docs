Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Ruby app. If you would like to use a framework, see the [reference docs](/docs/reference/ruby/overview).

<Steps>
  ## Install `clerk-sdk-ruby`

  <Include src="_partials/ruby/installation" />

  ## Configuration

  <Include src="_partials/ruby/configuration" />

  ## Instantiate a `Clerk::SDK` instance

  All available methods are listed in the [Ruby HTTP Client documentation](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-http-client-ruby/tree/main/.generated#documentation-for-api-endpoints){{ target: '_blank' }}. The Ruby HTTP Client is a generated wrapper around the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} that provides a more Ruby-friendly interface.

  To access available methods, you must instantiate a `Clerk::SDK` instance.

  ```ruby
  sdk = Clerk::SDK.new

  create_user_request = Clerk::SDK::CreateUserRequest.new(
    first_name: "John",
    last_name: "Doe",
    email_address: ["john.doe@example.com"],
    password: "password"
  )

  # Create a user
  sdk.users.create(create_user_request)

  # List all users and ensure the user was created
  sdk.users.get_user_list

  # Get the first user created in your instance
  user = sdk.users.get_user_list(limit: 1).first

  # Use the user's ID to lock the user
  sdk.users.lock_user(user["id"])

  # Then, unlock the user so they can sign in again
  sdk.users.unlock_user(user["id"])
  ```
</Steps>
