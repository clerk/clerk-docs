<Steps>
  ## Install `@clerk/astro`

  The [Clerk Astro SDK](/docs/references/astro/overview) provides a set of components, hooks, and stores that make it easy to build authentication and user management features in your Astro app.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/astro
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/astro
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/astro
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun add @clerk/astro
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable and Secret Keys.
    1. Paste your keys into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ## Update `astro.config.mjs`

  To configure Clerk in your Astro app, you will need to update your `astro.config.mjs`.

  - Add the `clerk()` integration to the `integrations` list. For a list of available options, see the [integration reference](/docs/references/astro/integration).
  - Install an [SSR adapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#official-adapters). This quickstart uses the [`@astrojs/node`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/) adapter.
  - Set `output` to `server`. This is required when deploying to a host supporting SSR.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'astro.config.mjs', mark: [2, 3, [6, 8]] }}
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
  import node from '@astrojs/node'
  import clerk from '@clerk/astro'

  export default defineConfig({
    integrations: [clerk()],
    adapter: node({ mode: 'standalone' }),
    output: 'server',
  })
  ```

  ## Add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app

  [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/references/astro/clerk-middleware) grants you access to user authentication state throughout your app, on any route or page. It also allows you to protect specific routes from unauthenticated users. To add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app, follow these steps:

  1. Create a `middleware.ts` file.
     - If you're using the `/src` directory, create `middleware.ts` in the `/src` directory.
     - If you're not using the `/src` directory, create `middleware.ts` in the root directory alongside `.env`.
  1. In your `middleware.ts` file, export an `onRequest` constant and assign the result of the `clerkMiddleware()` function to it.
     ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/middleware.ts' }}
     import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/astro/server'

     export const onRequest = clerkMiddleware()
     ```
  1. By default, `clerkMiddleware()` will not protect any routes. All routes are public and you must opt-in to protection for routes. See the [`clerkMiddleware()` reference](/docs/references/astro/clerk-middleware) to learn how to require authentication for specific routes.

  ## Add Clerk components to your app

  You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/components/overview#control-components). Create a header using the following components:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button): Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page. In this example, since no props or [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables) are set for the sign-in URL, this component links to the [Account Portal sign-in page](/docs/account-portal/overview#sign-in).

  ```astro {{ filename: 'src/layouts/Layout.astro' }}
  ---
  import { SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton, SignInButton } from '@clerk/astro/components'

  const { title } = Astro.props
  ---

  <!doctype html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8" />
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
      <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
      <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
      <title>Astro Basics</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <header>
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        <nav>
          <SignedOut>
            <SignInButton mode="modal" />
          </SignedOut>
          <SignedIn>
            <UserButton />
          </SignedIn>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <slot />
    </body>
  </html>

  <style>
    html,
    body {
      margin: 0;
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
    }
  </style>
  ```

  Then, use the layout on your homepage:

  ```astro {{ filename: 'src/pages/index.astro' }}
  ---
  import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro'
  ---

  <Layout title="Clerk + Astro">
    <p>Sign in to try Clerk out!</p>
  </Layout>
  ```

  ## Create your first user

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Now visit your app's homepage at [`http://localhost:4321`](http://localhost:4321). Sign up to create your first user.
