Popular hosting providers such as Cloudflare, Vercel, and more, offer preview deployments, which enable you to view changes to your site in a live environment before merging and deploying them to production.

There are two approaches to using Clerk in a preview environment:

- If you want to share *production* data with your preview environment, [use Vercel's Preview Deployment Suffix.](#vercel-preview-deployment-suffix)
- If you do not want to, or are not able to, expose *production* Clerk data to your preview environment, [use your development API keys.](#use-your-development-api-keys)

## Vercel Preview Deployment Suffix

If you would like your preview environment to share a userbase with your production environment, you can use [Vercel's Preview Deployment Suffix feature.](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/generated-urls#preview-deployment-suffix) Preview Deployment Suffixes allow you to customize the URL of a preview deployment by replacing the default `vercel.app` suffix with a custom domain of your choice.

To use Clerk with Vercel's Preview Deployment Suffix, you must have a Pro or Enterprise Vercel account.

The following steps will teach you how to configure your Vercel Preview Deployment Suffix with Clerk:

1. **Acquire a separate domain** - This domain will be used for your preview environment, and *cannot be a subdomain* of the domain used in your production environment. For example, if your production domain is `my-site.com`, you could use `my-site-previews.com` but you cannot use `previews.my-site.com`.
2. **Follow the Deploy to Vercel guide** - See [the Preview URL section of the Deploy to Vercel guide](/docs/deployments/deploy-to-vercel#support-for-vercel-preview-ur-ls) to configure your app.
3. **[Contact Clerk support](https://clerk.com/contact/support) to provision a preview-specific Clerk app for free** - If you are on a Pro, Enterprise, or Startup plan, Clerk will provision a dedicated preview-specific Clerk application with all the same features as your main application for free.
4. **Use production instance API keys** - Once Clerk support has provisioned your free preview-specific Clerk app, you should use its production instance API keys with your previews, as this offers better security and fewer limitations. See [the production instance documentation](/docs/deployments/environments#production-instance) to learn more.

### Limitations

- This approach requires a Vercel Pro or Enterprise account.
- This approach locks you into using Vercel for preview environments.

## Use your development API keys

If you would like your preview environment to have a different userbase from your production environment, you can set up your preview environment to use your development instance API keys.

To retrieve your development instance API keys:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
2. Ensure that **Development** is selected at the top.
3. In the navigation sidebar, select **API Keys**.
4. Copy your keys.

Once you have your development instance API keys, you can add them to your environment variables.

The following are environment variable guides from some popular providers:
    - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#declare-an-environment-variable)
    - [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/get-started/#create-environment-variables)
    - [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/#add-environment-variables-via-the-dashboar)

### Limitations of using development keys

The limitations of using development instance API keys in preview environments are:

- Added possibility of Clerk cookie errors. Remember to clear your cookies if you are encountering infinite redirects or authentication issues.
- Changes to user data will not be automatically mirrored in your main application for your production environment.
- There is a [maximum user limit](/docs/deployments/environments#development-instance).
- Features enabled in your development instance will not be available in your production environment without upgrading your Clerk plan.
- Development instance API keys offer less security overall compared to production instance keys.

See [the development instance documentation](/docs/deployments/environments#development-instance) to learn more.

## Staging environments

You can also use Clerk with [staging environments](/docs/deployments/set-up-staging).
