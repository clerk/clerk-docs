How to set up social connection with Box

## Overview

Adding social connection with Box to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your Box account.

> [!NOTE]
> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Box developer account and a Box OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Box developer account. To create one, [click here](https://developer.box.com/).

## Configuring Box social connection

First, you need to create a new OAuth2 Box app. You can find this option in your **Console > Create new app**. Choose **Custom App** and then select **User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)**.

You need to choose an app name and then click **Create application**.

Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections). In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Box**. Toggle on **Use custom credentials** and copy **Redirect URIs**.

Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** as shown in the above image. Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with Box is now configured for your instance.
