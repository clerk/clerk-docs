# Next.js server-side changes

<Callout type="info">
  Before starting this guide, please complete the [Client-side changes](/docs/upgrade-guides/v3-client-side-changes).
</Callout>

## API routes

Helpers for API routes have been updated to mirror the new [`useAuth()`][use-auth] hook on the client-side.

- `withSession` is deprecated and replaced with `withAuth`
- `requireSession` is deprecated with replaced with `requireAuth`
- Instead of decorating the `Request` object with a `Session` object, it is now decorated with an `Auth` object that mirrors [`useAuth()`][use-auth] on the client-side.
  - `const { userId, sessionId, getToken } = req.auth;`

### Example usage

```jsx
import { withAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/api";

export default withAuth(async (req, res) => {
  const { userId, sessionId, getToken } = req.auth;
  const hasuraToken = await getToken({template: "hasura"});
  
  // Your handler
});
```

## Edge middleware

Edge middleware has also been updated to mirror the new [`useAuth()`][use-auth] hook on the client-side. The import path has also been changed to avoid confusion.

```jsx
import { withEdgeMiddlewareAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/edge-middleware";

export const middleware = withEdgeMiddlewareAuth((req, ev) => {
  const { userId, sessionId, getToken } = req.auth;
  
  // Your middleware
});
```
