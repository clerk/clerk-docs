How to setup social connection with Coinbase

## Overview

Adding social connection with Coinbase to your app with Clerk is simple - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your Coinbase account.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Coinbase developer account and a Coinbase OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/social-connections-oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/get-started/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Coinbase developer account. To create one, [click here](https://www.coinbase.com/).

## Configuring Coinbase social connection

First, you need to create a new OAuth2 Coinbase app. You can find this option in your Profile > Settings > API > New OAuth2 Application

You need to set all the required fields and the corresponding Permitted Redirect URIs. Make sure to also select Reuse Existing Tokens for Previously-Authorized Users under Advanced settings so the users won't get notified everytime they sign in with their Coinbase account and click **Create application**.

Go to the [Social Connections page](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=authentication/social) and enable Coinbase. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Make sure the value matches the **Redirect URIs**, as shown below.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Social connection with Coinbase is now configured.
