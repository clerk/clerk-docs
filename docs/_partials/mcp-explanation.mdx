There are two parties involved in MCP - "client" and "server". In web development, the terms "client" and "server" often refer to the frontend (browser) and backend (web server). However, in this context, these terms have different meanings:

- The "client" is the LLM application that wants to access another service on a user's behalf. For example, Claude would be the "client" if it wants to get access to Gmail.
- The "server" is the system that hosts the protected resources the client wants to access. In this example, this would be Gmail. This is sometimes referred to as the "resource server" or "MCP server".
