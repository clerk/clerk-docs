  - Use Spotify to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Spotify account.

> [!CAUTION]
> For **development** instances, [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes) requires users to be added to the app's allowlist in order to use Spotify as a social provider in your Clerk app. If they are not allowlisted, any API requests made with an access token associated with that user and the Spotify app will receive a 403 status code.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Spotify as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Spotify**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create your app in Spotify

  1. On a separate page, go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/) and sign in.
  1. In the top-right, select your profile button and select [**Dashboard**](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
  1. Select [**Create app**](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/create).
  1. Complete the required fields. For **Redirect URIs**, add the **Redirect URI** that you saved from Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Save**.
  1. On your app page, select **Settings**. Keep this page open.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  1. In the Spotify app's settings page, save the **Client ID** and **Client secret** somewhere secure. To reveal the **Client secret**, you must select **View client secret**.
  1. Navigate back to your Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open and paste these values into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the **Spotify** connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal) page.
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:

  - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
  - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`

  1. Sign in with your Spotify account.
