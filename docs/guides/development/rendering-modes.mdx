By default, Next.js attempts to optimize your application by statically generating pages at build-time that do not depend on data from the request. However, authentication data is inherently dynamic and depends on the request, meaning that it is not available at build-time.

> [!TIP]
> Read more about static and dynamic rendering in the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/static-and-dynamic-rendering).

To facilitate Next.js's default behavior, Clerk provides an opt-in approach to accessing authentication data so that you can opt-in specific routes to dynamic rendering, while still using statically rendered pages for others.

The following options are available for accessing authentication data:

- The `auth()` helper can only be used in Server Components, but the data can be passed to Client Components if desired. It opts your entire route into dynamic rendering.
- The `useAuth()` hook can only be used in Client Components. Due to Next.js's default behavior, these components will be statically rendered. However, you can wrap them with `<ClerkProvider dynamic>` to opt them into dynamic rendering.

> [!NOTE]
> The upcoming [Partial Prerendering (PPR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/partial-prerendering) feature in Next.js gives more control over static and dynamic rendering. Wrapping components that access auth data with `<Suspense>` allows pages to be prerendered up to the `<Suspense>` boundaries.

## Access auth data with `auth()`

The [`auth()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth) helper returns the user's authentication state in Server Components. The data can be passed to Client Components if desired. This is a dynamic API that relies on request-time data so using `auth()` will opt your entire route into dynamic rendering.

```tsx
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

// This page will be dynamically rendered at request time
export default async function Page() {
  const { userId } = await auth()

  // This will be immediately available on first render
  console.log(userId)

  return <p>Hello, {userId}</p>
}
```

## Access auth data with `useAuth()`

`useAuth()` provides authentication data in Client Components. Due to Next.js's default behavior, these components will be statically rendered. If that's fine with you, see the [reference docs](/docs/reference/hooks/use-auth) for more information, like code examples.

However, if you'd like the components that use `useAuth()` to be dynamically rendered, you can wrap them with `<ClerkProvider dynamic>`. If you're using [PPR](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/partial-prerendering), consider wrapping `<ClerkProvider dynamic>` in `<Suspense>` so that the boundary fallback is included in the prerendered HTML.

> [!WARNING]
> It is not recommended and not optimal to wrap your entire application with `<ClerkProvider dynamic>` as this opts all routes into dynamic rendering, when some routes may be better suited for static rendering. If you're not sure if a route is better suited for static or dynamic rendering, see the [Next.js guide on static and dynamic rendering](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/static-and-dynamic-rendering).

The following example demonstrates how to use `<ClerkProvider dynamic>` in a page's layout in order to opt it into dynamic rendering. In this case, the [root layout](/docs/nextjs/getting-started/quickstart#add-clerk-provider-and-clerk-components-to-your-app) would still be wrapped with `<ClerkProvider>` to provide the authentication context to the entire app, but without the `dynamic` prop being passed as to not opt your entire app into dynamic rendering.

    // All of these will be immediately available on first render
    console.log(userId, sessionId, isSignedIn)

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Test Page</h1>
        <p>User ID: {userId}</p>
      </div>
    )
