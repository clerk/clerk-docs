description: Learn how to integrate Express into your Clerk application.
---

Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your Express application. This documentation covers the capabilities and methods available from Clerk's Express SDK.

See the [quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/express) to get started.

{/* TODO: Remove callout when Node SDK is removed from docs */}

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are upgrading from the Node SDK, see the [upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade-guides/node-to-express) for more information.

## Available methods

### `clerkMiddleware()`

The `clerkMiddleware()` function checks the request's cookies and headers for a session JWT and, if found, attaches the [`Auth`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#auth-object) object to the request object under the `auth` key.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

const app = express()

// Pass no parameters
app.use(clerkMiddleware())

// Pass options
app.use(clerkMiddleware(options))
```

#### Options

The `clerkMiddleware()` function accepts [these options](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#clerk-middleware-options) plus the following:

<Properties>
  - `clerkClient`
  - [`ClerkClient`](/docs/references/backend/overview#create-clerk-client-options)

  An instance of the ClerkClient class. This is used to interact with the Clerk API.

  ---

  - `debug`
  - `boolean`

  A flag to enable debug mode. When enabled, the middleware will log debug information to the console.

  ---

  - `enableHandshake`
  - `boolean`

  Enables Clerk's handshake flow, which helps verify the session state when a session JWT has expired. It issues a 307 redirect to refresh the session JWT if the user is still logged in. Defaults to `true`.
</Properties>

### `requireAuth()`

The `requireAuth()` middleware functions similarly to `clerkMiddleware()`, but also protects your routes by redirecting unauthenticated users to the sign-in page. It will look for a `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` environment variable and use that by default. If not present, you must pass a sign in URL to the middleware as an option.

```js
import { requireAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()

// Apply middleware to all routes
app.use(requireAuth())

// Apply middleware to a specific route - requires `process.env.CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` to be present
app.get('/protected', requireAuth(), (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route')
})

// Use a custom sign-in URL instead of the environment variable
app.get('/protected', requireAuth({ signInUrl: '/sign-in' }), (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route')
})
```

This middleware accepts the same [options](/docs/references/express/overview#options) as `clerkMiddleware()`.

### `getAuth()`

The `getAuth()` helper retrieves authentication state from the request object. See the [Next.js reference documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) for more information on how to use the returned `auth` object.

The following example uses `requireAuth()` to protect the route based on _authentication_ status, and then uses `getAuth()` to protect the route based on _authorization_ status.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware, getAuth, requireAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const port = 3000

// Apply centralized middleware
app.use(clerkMiddleware())

// Protect a route based on authorization status
const hasPermission = (req, res, next) => {
  const auth = getAuth(req)

  // Handle if the user is not authorized
  if (!auth.has({ permission: 'org:admin:testpermission' })) {
    return response.status(403).send('Forbidden')
  }

  return next()
}

app.get('/path', requireAuth(), hasPermission, (req, res) => res.json(req.auth))

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```

### `clerkClient`

[Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) exposes Clerk's Backend API resources and low-level authentication utilities for JavaScript environments. For example, if you wanted to get a list of all users in your application, instead of creating a fetch to Clerk's `https://api.clerk.com/v1/users` endpoint, you can use the `users.getUserList()` method provided by the JavaScript Backend SDK.

All resource operations are mounted as sub-APIs on the `clerkClient` object. See the [reference documentation](/docs/references/backend/overview#usage) for more information.

```js
import { clerkClient, requireAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  // Get the `userId` from the `Auth` object
  const userId = req.auth.userId

  if (!userId) {
    return void res.status(400).json({ error: 'Error: No signed-in user' })
  }

  // Use the userId to get information about the user
  const user = await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId)
  return void res.status(200).json(user)
})

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```
