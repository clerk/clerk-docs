# `<UserProfile />`

The `<UserProfile/>` component is used to render a beautiful, full-featured account management UI that allows users to manage their profile and security settings. 

## Usage

Using the [Next.js optional catch all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-routes), you can embed the `<UserProfile/>` component. This allows you to redirect the user inside your application and handle any redirects.

```jsx copy filename="/pages/user-profile/[[...index]].tsx"
import { UserProfile } from "@clerk/nextjs";

const UserProfilePage = () => (
  <UserProfile path="/user-profile" routing="path" />
);

export default UserProfilePage;
```
