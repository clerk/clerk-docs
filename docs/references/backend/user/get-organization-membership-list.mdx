# `getOrganizationMembershipList()`

Retrieves a list of organization memberships for a given user.

```tsx
function getOrganizationMembershipList: (params: GetOrganizationMembershipListParams) => Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<OrganizationMembership[]>>;
```

## `GetOrganizationMembershipListParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `userId` | `string` | The ID of the user to retrieve the list of organization memberships for. |
| `limit?` | `number` | The number of results to return. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than 501. |
| `offset?` | `number` | The number of results to skip. |

## Examples

### Basic

In this example, you can see that the returned [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) includes `data`, which is an array of [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/references/javascript/organization-membership) objects, and `totalCount`, which indicates the total number of organization memberships in the system for the specified organization.

```tsx
const userId = 'user_2V7JJKmoA9HqzHhfMqK5cpgLl56';

const response = await clerkClient.users.getOrganizationMembershipList({ userId });

console.log(response);
/*
{
  data: [
    _OrganizationMembership {
      id: 'orgmem_2bjJ8KfbbOyzmF4wMRU7kjHvsgI',
      role: 'org:admin',
      publicMetadata: {},
      privateMetadata: {},
      createdAt: 1706722393158,
      updatedAt: 1706722393158,
      organization: [_Organization],
      publicUserData: [_OrganizationMembershipPublicUserData]
    },
    _OrganizationMembership {
      id: 'orgmem_2bjJ4JMtzPQIBRWQqeFKdJ0fg1s',
      role: 'org:admin',
      publicMetadata: {},
      privateMetadata: {},
      createdAt: 1706722361154,
      updatedAt: 1706722361154,
      organization: [_Organization],
      publicUserData: [_OrganizationMembershipPublicUserData]
    }
  ],
  totalCount: 2
}
*/
```

### Limit the number of results

Retrieves a list of a user's organization memberships that is filtered by the number of results.

```tsx
const userId = 'user_123';

const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.users.getOrganizationMembershipList({
  userId,
  // returns the first 10 memberships
  limit: 10,
});
```

### Skip results

Retrieves a list of a user's organization memberships that is filtered by the number of results to skip.

```tsx
const userId = 'user_123';

const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.users.getOrganizationMembershipList({
  userId,
  // skips the first 10 memberships
  offset: 10,
});
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/users/{user_id}/organization_memberships`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/UsersGetOrganizationMemberships) for more details.
