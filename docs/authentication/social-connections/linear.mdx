How to setup social connection with Linear

## Overview

Adding social connection with Linear to your app with Clerk is simple - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URL** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your Linear account.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Linear OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/social-connections-oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/get-started/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Linear account. To create one, [click here](https://linear.app).

## Configuring Linear social connection

First, you need to create a new OAuth Linear app. You have to navigate on your Settings > Account > API > OAuth applications and click on **Create new**. On the modal that pops up, enter all the necessary info for your new app such as the name, the logo etc. For the Callback URLs field, go to the [Social Connections page](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=authentication/social) and enable Linear. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Paste the value in the field.
