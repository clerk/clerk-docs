The `UserProfileView` renders a comprehensive user profile interface that displays user information and provides account management options. It includes personal information, security settings, account switching, and sign-out functionality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `UserProfileView` only appears when a user is signed in.

## Parameters

<If sdk="ios">
  <Properties>
    - `isDismissable`
    - `Bool`

    Whether the view can be dismissed by the user. When `true`, a dismiss button appears in the navigation bar and the view can be used in sheets or other dismissable contexts. When `false`, no dismiss button is shown, making it suitable for fullscreen usage. Defaults to `true`.
  </Properties>
</If>

<If sdk="android">
  <Properties>
    - `clerkTheme`
    - `ClerkTheme`

    The theme to apply to the `UserProfileView`. This will override any theme applied to the `UserProfileView`'s parent view, or configured in the `Clerk` global object.

    ---

    - `onDismiss`
    - `() -> Unit`

    A callback function that is called when the user dismisses the view, such as when they tap a back button or close button. Use this callback to handle navigation or perform cleanup when the user closes the profile view, for example, navigating back to the previous screen or updating your app's state.
  </Properties>
</If>

## Usage

    @Environment(\.clerk) private var clerk
    @State private var profileIsPresented = false

    var body: some View {
      VStack {
        if clerk.user != nil {
          Button("Show Profile") {
            profileIsPresented = true
          }
        }
      }
      .sheet(isPresented: $profileIsPresented) {
        UserProfileView()
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Fullscreen profile view

  Use `UserProfileView` as a fullscreen view when you want to dedicate the entire screen to profile management.

  struct ProfileView: View {
    @Environment(\.clerk) private var clerk

    var body: some View {
      if clerk.user != nil {
        UserProfileView(isDismissable: false)
      }
    }
  }
  ```
