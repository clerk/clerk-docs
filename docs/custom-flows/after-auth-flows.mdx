title: Tasks after sign-up/sign-in (after-auth flows)
description: Learn how to use the Clerk API to build custom flows that require users to complete specific tasks after signing up or signing in.
---

You can configure your application to require users to complete specific tasks after signing up or signing in. Clerk refers to these tasks as [after-auth flows](/docs/authentication/configuration/after-auth-flows)

After signing up or signing in, users will have a session in a `pending` state. They must complete required tasks before their session transitions to a `signed-in` state. Only then will they be able to access protected content and routes in your application.

## Completing tasks after sign-in and sign-up

When a session has a pending task (accessible via [`session.currentTask`](/docs/references/javascript/session#properties)), the user must complete specific requirements before they can proceed. Each task type has different requirements that must be fulfilled using Clerk's Frontend API. The guide below explains how to handle these tasks and their requirements.
