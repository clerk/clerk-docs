description: Learn how to configure authentication and user management for your Clerk application.
---

Clerk supports multiple authentication strategies so that you can implement the strategy that makes sense for _your_ users. You can use the [Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview), [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview), or build your own [custom flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

## Configuration

Configuring your application is done through the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com). The Clerk Dashboard is where you, as the application owner, can manage your application's settings, users, and organizations. For example, if you want to enable phone number authentication, multi-factor authentication, social providers like Google, delete users, or create organizations, you can do all of this and more in the Clerk Dashboard. You can even invite other users to join your [organization workspace](/docs/organizations/organization-workspaces) and help configure and manage your application with you.

## SSO authentication

SSO authentication allows users to sign in to your application using an existing account from an external identity provider (IdP), such as Google.

Clerk supports the following SSO types:

- [OAuth SSO, also known as social connections or social providers](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth)
- [Enterprise SSO](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/overview)
  - SAML
  - OIDC
    - EASIE

## Web3 authentication

Clerk supports the following Web3 providers:

- [Coinbase Wallet](/docs/authentication/web3/coinbase-wallet)
- [Metamask](/docs/authentication/web3/metamask)
- [OKX Wallet](/docs/authentication/web3/okx-wallet)
