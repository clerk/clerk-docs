# Reassign the **Creator** role

When a user creates a new organization, that user is automatically added as the organization's first member and assigned whichever role is that org's [**Creator** role](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#the-creator-role). By default, that role is `admin`. You may want to remove the `admin` role or assign the **Creator** role to another role. This guide will show you how.

You *can't* delete an organization role if it's used as the organization **Creator** role. But, you *can* reassign the **Creator** role to any other role with the right permissions. For example, if you want to delete the `admin` role, you will have to assign another role the **Creator** role.

To reassign the **Creator** role, the target role must have the following [System Permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#system-permissions):

- Manage members (`org:sys_memberships:manage`)
- Read members (`org:sys_memberships:read`)
- Delete organization (`org:sys_profile:delete`)

## Give a role the necessary permissions and assign it as the **Creator** role

In your Clerk Dashboard, navigate to **Organization Settings** and select the [**Roles** tab](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=roles). If you haven't already, [create a new role](/docs/organizations/create-roles-permissions#create-a-new-role-for-your-organization) or select an existing role from the list.

1. Select **Show System Permissions**.
2. In the list of system permissions, select **Manage members,** **Read members,** and **Delete organization**.
3. At the top right of the screen, to the right of the role's name, open the "..." menu.
4. From the dropdown, select the **Set as Creator role** option.

In the example below, the `owner` role has been created and is being assigned as the **Creator** role.

## Assign the **Creator** role to an existing role in the roles list

If a role has the necessary permissions above, you can set it to the **Creator** role. To get to the organization's list of roles, in your Clerk Dashboard, navigate to **Organization Settings** and select the [**Roles** tab](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=roles). Open the  role's "..." menu and select **Set as Creator role**.

In the example below, the `owner` role is being assigned as the **Creator** role.
