# `EmailAddress`

The `EmailAddress` object is a model around an email address. Email addresses are used to provide identification for users.

Email addresses must be verified to ensure that they can be assigned to their rightful owners. The `EmailAddress` object holds all necessary state around the verification process.

The verification process always starts with the [`EmailAddress.prepareVerification()`](/docs/references/javascript/email-address/verification#prepare-verification) method, which will send a one-time verification code via an email message. The second and final step involves an attempt to complete the verification by calling the [`EmailAddress.attemptVerification()`](/docs/references/javascript/email-address/verification#attempt-verification) method, passing the one-time code as a parameter.

Finally, email addresses can be linked to other identifications.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | A unique identifier for this email address. |
| `emailAddress` | `string` | The value of this email address. |
| `verification` | [`Verification`](/docs/references/javascript/verification) | An object holding information on the verification of this email address. |
| `linkedTo` | `Array<{id: string, type: string}>` | An array of objects containing information about any identifications that might be linked to this email address. |

## Methods

### `create()`

Creates a new email address for the current user.

```typescript
function create(): Promise<EmailAddress>;
```

### `destroy()`

Deletes this email address.

```typescript
function destroy(): Promise<void>;
```

### `toString()`

Returns the value for this email address. Can also be accessed via the `EmailAddress.emailAddress` attribute.

```typescript
function toString(): string;
```

### `createEmailLinkFlow()`

Sets up an email verification with email link flow. Calling `createEmailLinkFlow()` will return two functions.

The first function is async and starts the email link flow, preparing a email link verification. It sends the email link email and starts polling for verification results. The signature is `startEmailLinkFlow({ redirectUrl: string }) => Promise<EmailAddress>`.

The second function can be used to stop polling at any time, allowing for full control of the flow and cleanup. The signature is `cancelEmailLinkFlow() => void`.

```typescript
function createEmailLinkFlow(): {
  startEmailLinkFlow: (params: StartEmailLinkFlowParams) => Promise<EmailAddress>;
  cancelEmailLinkFlow: () => void;
};
```

#### Returns

`createEmailLinkFlow` returns an object with two functions:

| Name | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `startEmailLinkFlow` | `(params: StartEmailLinkFlowParams) => Promise<EmailAddress>` | Function to start the email link flow. It prepares a email link verification and polls for the verification result. |
| `cancelEmailLinkFlow` | `() => void` | Function to cleanup the email link flow. Stops waiting for verification results. |

#### `StartEmailLinkFlowParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `redirectUrl` | `string` | The email link target URL. Users will be redirected here once they click the email link from their email. |

## Additional methods

In addition to the methods listed above, the `EmailAddress` class also has the following methods:

### Validation

- [`prepareVerification()`](/docs/references/javascript/email-address/verification#prepare-verification)
- [`attemptVerification()`](/docs/references/javascript/email-address/verification#attempt-verification)
