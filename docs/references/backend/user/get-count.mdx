description: Use Clerk's Backend SDK to retrieve the total number of users.

{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/api/endpoints/UserApi.ts#L189 */}

Retrieves the total number of users.

```ts
function getCount(params: UserCountParams): Promise<number>
```

## `UserCountParams`

The total count of users can be filtered down by adding one or more of these parameters.

<Properties>
  - `emailAddress?`
  - `string[]`

  The email addresses to filter by.

  ---

  - `phoneNumber?`
  - `string[]`

  The phone numbers to filter by.

  ---

  - `externalId?`
  - `string[]`

  The external ID's to filter by.

  ---

  - `username?`
  - `string[]`

  The usernames to filter by.

  ---

  - `web3wallet?`
  - `string[]`

  The web3wallet to filter by.

  ---

  - `userId?`
  - `string`

  The user ID's to filter by.

  ---

  - `query?`
  - `string`

  Counts users that match the given query. For possible matches, we check the email addresses, phone numbers, usernames, web3 wallets, user ids, first and last names. The query value doesn't need to match the exact value you are looking for, it is capable of partial matches as well.
</Properties>

## Examples

### Basic

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.users.getCount()

console.log(response)
/*
369
*/
```

### Filter by query

To do a broader match through a list of fields, you can use the query parameter which partially matches the fields: `userId`, `emailAddress`, `phoneNumber`, `username`, `web3Wallet`, and `externalId`.

This example retrieves the total number of users matching the query `test`.

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.users.getCount({ query: 'test' })
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/users/count`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/GetUsersCount){{ target: '_blank' }} for more details.
