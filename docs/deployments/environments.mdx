description: An overview of the differences between development and production instances.
---

When creating a new application within Clerk, you are provided with two instances: `Development` and `Production`.  These instances vary slightly and should only be used appropriately.

## Development instance

A `Development` instance is Clerk's default instance type and has characteristics that allow it to be more useful for local development. To facilitate development and local authentication, `Development` instances have a more relaxed security posture and are not suitable for production workloads.

Some notable examples of `Development`-only characteristics in a Clerk application are:

- A `Development` banner is shown prominently in the Clerk Dashboard to make clear you're managing or configuring non-production data
- Email and SMS templates are prefixed with the environment type to prevent against using `Development` instances for production purposes
- Some social connections use shared credentials by default
- [The Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview) will use a Clerk development domain that ends with `accounts.dev` instead of your app's production domain
- OAuth consent screens will show the development domain that ends with `accounts.dev` instead of your production domain
- Search engines will not be able to crawl and index your application
- Development instances are capped at 100 users, and user data can not be transferred between instances
- The architecture of Clerk's sessions management is different in development environments compared to production environments, due to the need to communicate cross-domain between `localhost` and `<slug>.accounts.dev`. The `__clerk_db_jwt` object is _only_ used in development environments. For more specific details on the differences between Clerk's session management architecture in development and production environments, see the [technical breakdown below](#session-management-architecture-differences-between-clerk-environments).

> [!NOTE]
> All paid functionality is available in a `Development` instance. However, when you deploy your application to `Production`, you will be asked to upgrade to a `Pro` account if you are using paid features. See [our pricing page](/pricing) for full details.

## Production instance

A `Production` instance is the more robust option of Clerk's instance types. `Production` instances are meant to support high volumes of traffic and by default, have a more strict security posture.

Some notable differences between `Production` and `Development` instances in a Clerk application are:

- You must associate a production domain within the Clerk Dashboard
- You are required to provision your own SSO credentials

When deploying to production, you must first activate your `Production` environment. See the [Deploying to Production](/docs/deployments/overview) guide to learn about the process and avoid common pitfalls.

## Staging environments

Clerk does not currently support staging instances in Clerk applications. However, you can set up a "staging environment" by creating a separate Clerk application with a separate domain. For more information, see the [staging guide](/docs/deployments/set-up-staging).

## Preview environments

See [the preview environment guide](/docs/deployments/set-up-preview-environment) to learn how to use Clerk with your preview deployments.

## Session management architecture differences between Clerk environments

> ![NOTE]
> In order to understand this section, it's recommended to have a solid understanding of how Clerk's session management architecture works. For more information on this topic, check out our guide on [how Clerk works](/docs/how-clerk-works/overview).

In production environments, Clerk uses a [client token](/docs/how-clerk-works/overview#client-token) to represent the user's session state. The client token is stored in an `HttpOnly` cookie on the [FAPI](https://clerk.com/docs/how-clerk-works/overview#the-frontend-api) domain, such that when your app's frontend makes a request to FAPI, the client token is sent along with the request. This works cleanly as FAPI is hosted on the same domain as your app's frontend due to the use of a CNAME record to alias Clerk's FAPI to a subdomain of your application (e.g., `clerk.example.com`).

However, in development environments, requests from your app's frontend to FAPI are **cross-site**, as the development environment is typically accessed through a localhost domain, and FAPI for development instances is hosted on a domain that ends with `accounts.dev`. This means that the client token cannot be securely and reliably stored and transmitted in a cookie.

> In order for cookies to be sent cross-site, the cookie would need to be set with [SameSite=None](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#none). In theory this would resolve the issue, but in reality, modern browsers are increasingly restrictive on cross-site cookie behavior due to the abuse of cookies for tracking and advertising. Safari specifically [does not support `SameSite=None` for cookies at all](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/browse-the-web-privately-iphb01fc3c85/ios) unless a browser flag is enabled. Other browsers also have restrictions around cross-site cookie behavior, which leads to a frustrating and unreliable experience for local development.

As such, development instances use a different approach to maintain session state. A object called the "dev browser", which is linked directly to the client token within Clerk's internals, is used to maintain session state across the session lifetime, and transmitted via querystring (`__clerk_db_jwt`) rather than via cookie. This strategy allows for a more reliable experience for local development, as it does not require the use of cross-site cookies.

However, this strategy is not secure enough for production use. Including a sensitive value like the client token in a querystring is not a strong security practice, as it can be seen directly in server logs, browser history, internet providers' logs, and could be potentially intercepted by third-parties via malicious browser extensions or network interceptors. As such, the `__clerk_db_jwt` object is **not used in production instances**. Instead, when creating a production environment, FAPI is aliased on to the same domain as your app via DNS, and a same-site cookie (`__client`) is used to maintain session state.
