Clerk billing supports webhook events that allow you to track information like subscription lifecycles and payments.

## Subscriptions

A subscription is a top level container unique to each user or organization. Subscription events can help you track billing changes for each of your customers.

| Event Name | Description |
| - | - |
| `subscription.created` | The top level subscription is created. This usually happens on user or organization creation. For existing users and organizations, a subscription will be created when billing is enabled for the application. |
| `subscription.updated` | The top level subscription is updated. This event is triggered when any property of the subscription has changed other than status changes. For example, when the subscription items for the payer change. |
| `subscription.active` | The top level subscription is set to active from a non-active status. The subscription is set to active if any subscription item is set to active, including for the free, default plan. |
| `subscription.past_due` | The top level subscription contains a subscription item which has become past due. |

## Subscription Items

A subscription item provides details about the relationship between the payer (user or organization) and a plan. A top level subscription may contain multiple subscription items.

There can only be one `active` subscription item per payer and plan. In addition, the subscription item for the default plan will always have the same `id` to allow easier tracking of which users and organizations are not paid customers.

| Event Name | Description |
| - | - |
| `subscriptionItem.updated` | The subscription item is updated. This event is triggered when a property of the subscription item has changed that does not result in a status change. For example, when a subscription item is renewed and the recurring monthly charge succeeds, the status doesn't change (remains `active`), but the `period_start` and `period_end` is updated. This results in a `subscriptionItem.updated` event. |
| `subscriptionItem.active` | The subscription item is set to active. For paid plans, this happens on successful payment. |
| `subscriptionItem.canceled` | The subscription item is canceled. The payer retains plan features until the end of the current billing period. |
| `subscriptionItem.upcoming` | The subscription item is set as upcoming after the current billing period. This can happen in the case of a deferred plan change from a higher priced to lower priced plan. In the case a paid plan is canceled, the subscription item for the default, free plan will be set as `upcoming`. |
| `subscriptionItem.ended` | The subscription item has been ended. |
| `subscriptionItem.abandoned` | The subscription item is abandoned. This can happen to `upcoming` subscription items if the payer subscribes to another plan, or re-subscribes to a currently canceled plan. |
| `subscriptionItem.incomplete` | The subscriptoin item is incomplete. This means the payer has begun a checkout for a plan, but the payment has not been processed successfully yet. Once processed successfully, the subscription item will transition to `active` status. |
| `subscriptionItem.past_due` | The subscription item is past due because a recurring charge has failed. |

## Payment attempts

Payment attempts allow you to track successful and failed payments, for both checkout and recurring charges.

Payment attempt events contain a `type`, which is either `checkout` or `recurring`. You can use these values to determine whether a payment attempt was for a checkout or for a subscription item renewal's recurring charge.

| Event Name | Description |
| - | - |
| `paymentAttempt.created` | A payment attempt has been created with `pending` status. It can either succeed or fail in the future. |
| `paymentAttempt.updated` | A payment attempt has been updated to `paid` or `failed` status. |
