# Configure Clerk Content-Security-Policy headers

[Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) (CSP) headers secure your document by preventing resources from being loaded from unexpected sources. This protects your apps from [XSS](/docs/security/xss-leak-protection#xss-leak-protection) attacks and data injections.

You can configure the following CSP headers:

1. `script-src` – This value should be the host application's FAPI hostname, for example `https://clerk.your-domain.com`.
2. `connect-src` – This value should also be the host application's FAPI hostname, for example `https://clerk.your-domain.com`.
3. `img-src` – This value should be `https://img.clerk.com`.
4. `worker-src`: This value should be the host application's hostname `https://app.your-domain.com`

The following example demonstrates a Next.js config file that sets Clerk's CSP headers correctly.

```js filename="next.config.js"
const cspHeader = `
  script-src: https://clerk.your-domain.com
  connect-src: https://clerk.your-domain.com
  img-src: https://img.clerk.com
  worker-src: https://app.your-domain.com
`;

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/(.*)",
        headers: [
          {
            key: "Content-Security-Policy",
            value: cspHeader.replace(/\n/g, ""),
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```
