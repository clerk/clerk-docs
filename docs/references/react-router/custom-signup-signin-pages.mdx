title: Build your own sign-in and sign-up pages for your React Router app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add custom sign-in and sign-up pages to your React Router app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) and [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) components with the [React Router Splat route](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/routing#splats) in order to build custom sign-in and sign-up pages for your React Router app.

If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

The functionality of the components are controlled by the instance settings you specify in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).

<Steps>
  ## Build your sign-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-up.tsx' }}
  import { SignUp } from '@clerk/remix'

  export default function SignUpPage() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Sign Up route</h1>
        <SignUp />
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Build your sign-in page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-in.tsx' }}
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/remix'

  export default function SignInPage() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Sign In route</h1>
        <SignIn />
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Configure routes

  React Router expects you to define routes in [`app/routes.ts`](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/routing). Add the previously created sign-in and sign-up pages to your configuration.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes.ts', mark: [5, 6] }}
  import { type RouteConfig, index, route } from '@react-router/dev/routes'

  export default [
    index('routes/home.tsx'),
    route('sign-in/*', 'routes/sign-in.tsx'),
    route('sign-up/*', 'routes/sign-up.tsx'),
  ] satisfies RouteConfig
  ```

  ## Configure redirect behavior

  Add environment variables for the `signIn`, `signUp`, `afterSignUp`, and `afterSignIn` paths:

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_URL=/
  CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_URL=/
  ```

  These values control the behavior of the components when you sign in or sign up and when you click on the respective links at the bottom of each component.

  ## Visit your new pages

  Run your project with the following terminal command from the root directory of your project:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom pages locally at [localhost:5173/sign-in](http://localhost:5173/sign-in) and [localhost:5173/sign-up](http://localhost:5173/sign-up).
