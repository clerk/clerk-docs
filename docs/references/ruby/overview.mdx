# Clerk Ruby SDK

<Steps>
  ### Create a Clerk application

  You need to create a Clerk application in your Clerk Dashboard before you can set up Clerk Ruby. For more information, check out our [Set up your application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) guide.

  ### Install Ruby

  Once a Clerk application has been created, you can install and then start using Clerk Ruby in your application.

  Add this line to your application's Gemfile.

  ```ruby {{ prettier: false }}
  gem 'clerk-sdk-ruby', require: "clerk"
  ```

  And then execute:

  ```sh {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
  $ bundle install
  ```

  Or install it yourself as:

  ```sh {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
  $ gem install clerk-sdk-ruby
  ```

  ### Instantiate a `Clerk::SDK` instance

  To access all [Backend API endpoints](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api), you need to instantiate a `Clerk::SDK` instance.

  You will need your Clerk secret key to instantiate an instance. Go to the Clerk Dashboard and navigate to the **[API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)** page and copy your secret key.

  This examples shows how to instantiate an instance of `Clerk::SDK` with your secret key and then send your first user a welcome email.

  ```ruby {{ prettier: false }}
  clerk = Clerk::SDK.new(api_key: `{{secret}}`)

  # List all users
  clerk.users.all

  # Get your first user
  user = clerk.users.all(limit: 1).first

  # Extract their primary email address ID
  email_id = user["primary_email_address_id"]

  # Send them a welcome email
  clerk.emails.create(
      email_address_id: email_id,
      from_email_name: "welcome",
      subject: "Welcome to MyApp",
      body: "Welcome to MyApp, #{user["first_name"]}",
  )
  ```

  ### Configuration

  The SDK can be configured in three ways: environment variables, configuration singleton and constructor arguments. The priority goes like this:

  - Constructor arguments
  - Configuration object
  - Environment variables

  #### Constructor arguments

  You can customize each instance of the `Clerk::SDK` object by passing keyword arguments to the constructor:

  ```ruby {{ prettier: false }}
  clerk = Clerk::SDK.new(
      api_key: `{{secret}}`,
      base_url: "Y",
      logger: Logger.new()
  )
  ```

  #### Configuration object

  If an argument is not provided, the configuration object is looked up, which falls back to the associated environment variable. Here's an example with all supported configuration settings their environment variable equivalents:

  ```ruby {{ prettier: false }}
  Clerk.configure do |c|
    c.api_key = `{{secret}}` # if omitted: ENV["CLERK_SECRET_KEY"] - API calls will fail if unset
    c.base_url = "https://..." # if omitted: "https://api.clerk.com/v1/"
    c.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT) # if omitted, no logging
    c.middleware_cache_store = Rails.cache # if omitted: no caching
  end
  ```

  Refer to the [Faraday documentation](https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/#/) for details.

  #### Environment variables

  Here's a list of all environment variables the SDK uses:

  | Variable name | Usage |
  | - | - |
  | `CLERK_API_BASE` | Overrides the default API base URL: `https://api.clerk.com/v1/` |
  | `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | The Secret key of your instance (required) |
  | `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` | Rails view helper: `clerk_sign_in_url` |
  | `CLERK_SIGN_IN_UP` | Rails view helper: `clerk_sign_up_url` |
  | `CLERK_USER_PROFILE_URL` | Rails view helper: `clerk_user_profile_url` |
</Steps>
