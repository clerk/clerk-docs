# `<RedirectToSignUp />`

The `<RedirectToSignUp />` component will navigate to the sign up URL which has been configured in your application instance. The behavior will be just like a server-side (3xx) redirect, and will override the current location in the history stack.

    SignedOut,
    RedirectToSignUp,
