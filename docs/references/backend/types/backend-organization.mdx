The Backend `Organization` object is similar to the [`Organization`](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) object as it holds information about an organization, as well as methods for managing it. However, the Backend `Organization` object is different in that it is used in the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organizations#operation/ListOrganizations){{ target: '_blank' }} and is not directly accessible from the Frontend API.
