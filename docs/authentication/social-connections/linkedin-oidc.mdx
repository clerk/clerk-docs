  - Use LinkedIn OIDC to authenticate users with OAuth.
</TutorialHero>

## Configure for your development instance

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for _development instances_ - no other configuration is needed. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard and go to **User & Authentication -> [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)**. In the list of **Auth Providers**, enable LinkedIn and select **Save**.

## Configure for your production instance

In _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials, which includes generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your LinkedIn Developer account. Don't worry, this tutorial will walk you through that process in just a few steps.

<Steps>
  ### Create a LinkedIn application

  > [!TIP]
  > If you already have a LinkedIn app you'd like to connect to Clerk, select your app from the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/) and skip to [the next step in this tutorial](#get-your-client-id-and-client-secret).

  1. On the homepage of the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/), select **Create app**. You'll be taken to the **Create an app** form.
  1. Fill out the form as follows:
     1. Under _App name_, name the application whatever you'd like. "Clerk Demo App", for example.
     1. Under **LinkedIn Page**, paste the URL of the LinkedIn page you'd like to associate with the application.
     1. Under **App logo**, upload an image to represent the application.
     1. Under **Legal agreement**, select the checkbox to agree to LinkedIn's API Terms of Use.
     1. Finally, select **Create app**.

  ### Get your client ID and client secret

  Once your LinkedIn app is created, you'll be taken to the app's dashboard.

  1. Select the **Auth** tab.
  1. Under **Application credentials**, you'll find your **Client ID** and **Primary Client Secret**. Copy these values and save them somewhere secure, as they are required to connect your LinkedIn app to your Clerk app.
  1. Keep this page open, as you'll need to come back to it in a moment.

  ### Connect your LinkedIn app and get your redirect URI

  1. In another tab, visit the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections).
  1. In the navigation sidebar, go to **User & Authentication > Social Connections**.
  1. In the list of **Auth Providers**, enable LinkedIn.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on. Then:
     1. Under **Client ID**, add the value you copied from **Client ID** in the LinkedIn dashboard.
     1. Under **Client Secret**, add the value you copied from **Primary Client Secret** in the LinkedIn dashboard.
     1. Copy the **Authorized redirect URI**. You need it to configure your LinkedIn app.
     1. Select **Save**.

  ### Set the Authorized Redirect URI for your LinkedIn application

  1. Navigate back to the LinkedIn Developer Portal and go to the **Auth** tab.
  1. Under the **OAuth 2.0 settings** section, next to **Authorized redirect URLs for your app**, select the **Edit** icon.
  1. Select **Add redirect URL** and add the **Authorized redirect URI** you copied from the Clerk Dashboard.

  ### Enable OpenID Connect in your LinkedIn application

  1. Select the **Products** tab.
  1. Next to **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect**, select **Request access**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you need to ensure the longevity of the user's access token without the need for re-authentication, make sure to obtain approval as a [Marketing Developer Platform (MDP) partner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/quick-start?view=li-lms-2023-10#step-1-apply-for-api-access). This is not required if you don't directly interact with the LinkedIn API using the access token.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk application's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal//overview), which is available for all Clerk applications out-of-the-box.

  1. In the navigation sidebar of the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal).
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:
     - For development – [https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in](https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in)
     - For production – [https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in](https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in)
  1. On the sign-in page, you should see **Continue with LinkedIn** as an option. Use it to sign in with your LinkedIn account.
