description: Learn how to add a custom sign-in-or-up page to your React Router app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
sdk: react-router
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in) component to build a custom page **that allows users to sign in or sign up within a single flow**.

To set up separate sign-in and sign-up pages, follow this guide, and then follow the [custom sign-up page guide](/docs/react-router/guides/development/custom-sign-up-page).

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-in-or-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in) component on a dedicated page using the [React Router Splat route](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/routing#splats).

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-in.tsx' }}
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/react-router'

  export default function SignInPage() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Sign in or up route</h1>
        <SignIn />
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Configure routes

  React Router expects you to define routes in [`app/routes.ts`](https://reactrouter.com/start/framework/routing). Add the previously created sign-in-or-up page to your route configuration.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes.ts', mark: [5] }}
  import { type RouteConfig, index, route } from '@react-router/dev/routes'

  export default [
    index('routes/home.tsx'),
    route('sign-in/*', 'routes/sign-in.tsx'),
  ] satisfies RouteConfig
  ```

  ## Configure redirect behavior

  - Set the `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` environment variable to tell Clerk where the `<SignIn />` component is being hosted.
  - Set `CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users visit the `/sign-in` route directly.
  - Set `CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users select the 'Don't have an account? Sign up' link at the bottom of the component.

  Learn more about these environment variables and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/development/customize-redirect-urls).

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
  CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
  ```

  ## Visit your new page

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:5173/sign-in](http://localhost:5173/sign-in).
