Free trials let customers experience paid features of a plan before starting a paid subscription. You can enable trials per plan or apply the same settings to all plans. The minimum trial length is 1 day.

## Enable free trials

To enable free trials for your plans:

1. Navigate to the [**Plans**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/plans) page in the Clerk Dashboard
1. Select the plan you want to add a free trial to
1. Toggle **Free trial** on
1. Set the number of trial days (minimum is 1 day)

You can apply free-trial settings across all plans if desired, or configure each plan individually.

## Eligibility

Only customers who have never paid for a subscription are eligible for free trials. If a customer has previously had a paid subscription to your service, they will not be able to access free trials again.

## Credit card requirement

A credit card is required to start a free trial. This requirement serves as a mechanism to prevent abuse and ensures a smooth transition to paid service when the trial expires.

## What your customers experience

### During a trial

Customers get access to the plan's paid features for the configured number of days.
If they cancel during the trial, they keep access until the original trial end date.

### When the trial ends

If the customer didn't cancel their subscription during the trial, they are charged using their default payment method on file. This may be a different payment method than the one used during checkout when the trial started.
If canceled, access ends at the trial end date and the customer is moved back to the free plan. No charges are made.

## Notifications

Both you and your customers receive notifications when a trial is about to expire:

### Developer notifications

You'll receive a `subscriptionItem.freeTrialEnding` webhook event 3 days before the trial expires. If the trial period is shorter than 3 days, the webhook is sent immediately when the trial begins.

### Customer notifications

Customers receive an email notification 3 days before their trial expires. For trials shorter than 3 days, the notification is sent immediately when the trial begins.

## Managing active trials

You can manually change the duration of a customer's trial:

- **Cancel at the end of the trial**: Cancel the trial while allowing the customer to keep access to the paid features until the trial period ends. This prevents their default payment method from being charged when the trial period ends.
- **End immediately**: Terminate the trial immediately and move the customer back to the free plan
- **Extend a trial:** Extend a specific subscriptionâ€™s trial on a case-by-case basis.

You can only manage the trial of a customer while the trial is active. Once a trial ends, you can no longer extend or cancel it.
## Customer trial cancelation

When customers cancel their own trial, they retain access to all trial features until the original trial period expires. Once the period ends, they are automatically moved to the free plan without being charged.
