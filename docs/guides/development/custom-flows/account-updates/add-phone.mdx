Users are able to add multiple phone numbers to their account. Adding a phone number requires the user to verify the phone number before it can be added to the user's account.

This guide demonstrates how to build a custom user interface that allows users to add and verify a phone number for their account.

## Configure phone number verification

To use phone number verification, you first need to enable it for your application.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**User & authentication**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/user-and-authentication) page.
1. Select the **Phone** tab and enable either **Sign-up with phone** or **Sign-in with phone** or both, depending on your application's needs.

## Build the custom flow

1. Every user has a [`User`](/docs/reference/javascript/user) object that represents their account. The `User` object has a `phoneNumbers` property that contains all the phone numbers associated with the user. The [`useUser()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-user) hook is used to get the `User` object.
1. The [`User.createPhoneNumber()`](/docs/reference/javascript/user#create-phone-number) method is passed to the [`useReverification()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-reverification) hook to require the user to reverify their credentials before being able to add a phone number to their account.
1. If the `createPhoneNumber()` function is successful, a new [`PhoneNumber`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/phone-number) object is created and stored in `User.phoneNumbers`.
1. Uses the `prepareVerification()` method on the newly created `PhoneNumber` object to send a verification code to the user.
1. Uses the `attemptVerification()` method on the same `PhoneNumber` object with the verification code provided by the user to verify the phone number.
