OAuth (Open Authorization) is a widely adopted standard designed by the IETF to provide a secure way for users to grant third-party applications limited access to their data and resources without providing their login credentials directly. 

This guide explains the fundamentals of OAuth using practical examples and outlines its different use cases, helping developers navigate the complexities of implementing OAuth in modern apps. 

## What is OAuth?

OAuth enables users to grant applications access to their resources - such as posting on their behalf - without sharing their username and password. This ensures secure, limited, and auditable access.

For example, consider a marketing manager who uses a content-planning application schedule posts across social media platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook. This application (let’s call it Content Planner) needs permission to post on the user’s behalf. 

Rather than asking for a username and password, which could compromise account security, OAuth allows Content Planner to request limited permissions (such as posting content) while restricting sensitive actions like deleting the account or changing the password. 

OAuth also addresses modern security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and detection of automated login attempts, which can block bots or suspicious login patterns. By using OAuth, apps can securely and efficiently obtain the appropriate level of access. 

## Why not use credentials directly?

Using credentials directly is both insecure and impractical: 

- **Principle of least privilege:** users typically do not want to grant full access to their accounts. OAuth allows apps to request only the permissions they truly need, reducing security risks.
- **Automated logins and security controls:** many authentication systems detect and block scripted logins to protect against bots and abuse. OAuth provides a standardized way to grant access without bypassing these controls.
- **Multi-factor authentication:** email and password alone often aren’t enough to access accounts today. OAuth integrates seamlessly with additional security factors like one-time passcodes or app-based authenticators.

## Key terminology

Before diving deeper, it’s essential to understand the following terms for working with OAuth:

- Client: the application requesting access to a user’s data/ resources. In the example above, Content Planner is the client.
- Authorization service: the service responsible for authenticating the user and granting third-party applications access to a user’s account, based on the user’s consent. For example, Twitter’s auth service manages this process for application that want to access Twitter’s resources. This is sometimes referred to as an **authorization server** or **identity provider (IdP)**.
- Resource service: the service that holds the data or resources the client wants to access. In this case, Twitter’s API is the resource service. This is sometimes referred to as a **resource server.**
- OAuth access token: a randomly generated string or JWT that is given to the Client by the Authorization service if the OAuth process is completed successfully. The Client can then send this token to the Resource service as a form of proof to be allow to access the relevant resources and data.

## OAuth flow overview

With all of this covered, this is what a typical OAuth flow would look like:

## OAuth use cases

It’s important to recognize that OAuth is broader than the single use case described so far. The diagram above illustrates just one way OAuth is used (granting third-party applications scoped access to a user’s data), but OAuth can also be used in many other scenarios. To help clarify these use cases, Clerk is introducing more precise terminology: 

1. OAuth Scoped Access: granting a third-party app limited access to a user’s data - this is the use case described in the diagram above. 
2. OAuth Single Sign-On (SSO): allowing users to sign in/sign up to an app using a third-party provider (e.g. “Sign in with Google).
3. OAuth User Management: using OAuth as a full user registration and sign-in/out mechanism (a full authorization service built with OAuth).
