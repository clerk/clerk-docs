description: Learn about various ways to make cross-origin requests to the backend when using Clerk SDKs.

If your client and server are on different origins (e.g. making an API call to a server on `api.foo.com` from JavaScript running on a client at `foo.com`), the [session token](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens) needs to be passed in a network request header. There are a few different ways this can be done on the front-end.

## Using Fetch with React

In order to pass the session token using the browser Fetch API, it should be put inside a Bearer token in the Authorization header. To retrieve the session token, use the `getToken` method from the [`useAuth()`](/docs/references/react/use-auth) hook. Be mindful that `getToken` is an async function that returns a Promise which needs to be resolved.

```js
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function useFetch() {
  const { getToken } = useAuth()

  const authenticatedFetch = async (...args) => {
    return fetch(...args, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${await getToken()}` },
    }).then((res) => res.json())
  }

  return authenticatedFetch
}
```

## useSWR hook

If you are using React or Next.js and want to use the [`useSWR`](https://swr.vercel.app/) hook, you can create a custom hook by utilizing Clerk's [`useAuth()`](/docs/references/react/use-auth) hook. `useAuth()` returns the asynchronous `getToken` function that can be called to add the session token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header of requests.

```js
import useSWR from 'swr'
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function useClerkSWR(url) {
  const { getToken } = useAuth()

  const fetcher = async (...args) => {
    return fetch(...args, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${await getToken()}` },
    }).then((res) => res.json())
  }

  return useSWR(url, fetcher)
}
```

## Tanstack Query (React Query)

If you are using [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/overview), you need to use a query function that throws errors. Since the native Fetch API does not, you can add it in.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure that you have your application wrapped in `<QueryClientProvider />` with a `QueryClient` set.

```js
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function useClerkQuery(url) {
  const { getToken } = useAuth()

  return useQuery(url, async () => {
    const res = await fetch(url, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${await getToken()}` },
    })

    if (!res.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response error')
    }

    return res.json()
  })
}
```

## Using Fetch with ClerkJS

If you are not using React or Next.js, you can access the `getToken` method from the `session` property of the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object. This assumes you have already followed the instructions on [setting up ClerkJS](/docs/references/javascript/overview) and provided it with your Frontend API URL.

```js
(async () => {
  fetch('/api/foo', {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${await Clerk.session.getToken()}`,
    },
  }).then((res) => res.json())
})()
```
