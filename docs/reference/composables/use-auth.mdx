## How to use the `useAuth()` composable

The following example demonstrates how to use the `useAuth()` composable to access the current auth state, like whether the user is signed in or not. It also includes a basic example for using the `getToken()` method to retrieve a session token for fetching data from an external resource.

```vue {{ filename: 'app/pages/protected-page.vue' }}
<script setup>
const { getToken, isLoaded, isSignedIn, sessionId, userId } = useAuth()

const fetchProtectedData = async () => {
  // Use `getToken()` to get the current user's session token
  const token = await getToken.value()

  // Use the token to fetch data from an external API
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
  })

  return response.json()
}
</script>

<template>
  <!-- Use `isLoaded` to check if Clerk is loaded -->
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">Loading...</div>
  <!-- Use `isSignedIn` to check if the user is signed in -->
  <div v-else-if="!isSignedIn">Sign in to view this page</div>
  <!-- Use `userId` to access the current user's ID and `sessionId` to access the current session ID -->
  <div v-else>Hello, {{ userId }}! Your current active session is {{ sessionId }}.</div>
</template>
```
