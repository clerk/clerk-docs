# Direct links

## Redirect URL

If a user accesses an Account Portal page _directly_, the `redirect_url` query param will not be present, so the user cannot be redirected back to your application once they are finished with their Account Portal flow. To prevent this, it is recommend that you always specify the redirect in the link when sharing it.

You can use the following format for your direct links:

`https://accounts.<your-domain.com>/<account-portal-page>?redirect_url=<your-redirect-url>`

**Example**

If you use `https://accounts.myapp.com/sign-in?redirect_url=https://myapp.com/dashboard`

The domain is `myapp.com`, the user is being linked to the sign-in Account Portal page at `http://accounts.myapp.com/sign-in` and they will be redirected to `https://myapp.com/dashboard` after they are signed in.

## Fallback redirects

In the case that a user _does_ visit an Account Portal page directly without the query param, you can set up fallback redirects to ensure that the user is redirected back to your application after they are finished with their Account Portal flow.

### Sign-in and sign-up

Set the appropriate [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) to configure the fallback redirects for sign-in and sign-up.

### Sign out

Set the post-sign-out redirect by passing the `afterSignOutUrl` prop to the `<ClerkProvider>` component. See the [reference doc](/docs/components/clerk-provider) for more information.

### Organization redirects

Both the `<OrganizationProfile />` and `<OrganizationSwitcher />` components accept an `afterLeaveOrganizationUrl` prop for setting the redirect after leaving an organization.

The `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component accepts an `afterSelectOrganizationUrl` prop for setting the redirect after selecting an organization, and an `afterCreateOrganizationUrl` prop for setting the redirect after creating an organization.

## Prefill sign in and sign up fields

In the case of direct links, the values to be used for prefilling the fields for sign-in or sign-up can be specified via the following query parameters:

- `email_address`
- `phone_number`
- `username`
- `first_name`
- `last_name`

For example, visiting `https://accounts.example.com/sign-in?username=nick` will result in the username field being prefilled with the value `nick`.
