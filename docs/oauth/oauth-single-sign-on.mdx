title: Use OAuth for single sign-on
description: Learn how to implement single sign-on with OAuth in your Clerk application or when signing into a third-party app.
---

Clerk supports two primary Single Sign-On (SSO) options using OAuth:

- Authenticate users into your Clerk application using external social providers (e.g. Google)
- Enable users to sign in to third-party apps using Clerk as an Identity Provider (IdP)

These features help you streamline authentication for your users, whether they're signing into your Clerk-powered app or accessing external apps with their Clerk credentials. This guide covers both options in detail and provides links to additional resources where applicable.

## Option 1: Let users authenticate into your Clerk application with social providers

This feature allows users to sign up/sign in to your Clerk app using their existing credentials from popular social providers - also known as Identity Providers (IdP) - like Google, Facebook, or Github. For example, if you enable Github as a social provider, then a user can sign in to your Clerk app by selecting Github as an option and authenticating with their Github account credentials.

Refer to the [Social connections guide](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview) for implementation details.

## Option 2: Let users authenticate into third-party applications using Clerk as an Identity Provider (IdP)

Clerk can be configured as an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) IdP to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) with other clients that support these protocols. This feature allows users to authenticate to other applications using their Clerk credentials, enabling user information sharing between your Clerk app and OAuth clients.

For example, if your user wants to sign in to a third-party app, they can select Clerk as the IdP and use their Clerk credentials to sign in. It's similar to the first option, but in reverse: instead of using a social provider to authenticate into your Clerk app, users use their Clerk credentials to sign in to an external app.

## Configure Clerk as an IdP

Clerk is the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC IdP for your application. The "client" is the third party site or tool that you want your users to authenticate to.

In order to make your Clerk instance operate as a provider, create an OAuth app in the Clerk Dashboard. Then, configure the client to work with your Clerk instance, using the necessary data from your Clerk OAuth app.

### Create a Clerk OAuth application

To create an OAuth application:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**OAuth Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/oauth-applications) page.
1. Select the **Add OAuth application** button. A modal will open.
1. Complete the following fields:
   - `Name` - Helps you identify your application.
   - `Scopes` - The scopes that you would like to leverage. To find out more about the scopes currently supported by Clerk, check out the [OAuth implementation reference documentation](/docs/oauth/how-clerk-implements-oauth#scopes).
1. Select **Add**. A modal will open with your **Client Secret**.

   > [!WARNING]
   > For security reasons, Clerk does not store your Client Secret and cannot show it to you again, so ensure to download the secret and store it someplace secure.
1. You'll be redirected to your app's settings page. Under **Application credentials**, you can find your **Client ID**, which will be useful for configuring the client to work with your Clerk instance.
1. In the **Redirect URIs** field, add the redirect URI provided by your client. This is the URL that Clerk will redirect to after the user has authenticated.

If you're interested to know more about additional configuration settings, refer to the [dedicated reference documentation](/docs/oauth/how-clerk-implements-oauth).

### Configure your client

Now that you have set up a Clerk OAuth app, you will need to configure any of the following settings needed in your client.

- **Client ID**: Public identifier of your Clerk OAuth app, found in your Clerk OAuth app's settings.
- **Client Secret**: Confidential secret used to authenticate your Clerk OAuth app.
- **Discovery URL**: Used by the client to retrieve the configuration data of the Clerk OAuth app.
- **Authorize URL**: Used by the client to request authorization from your user.
- **Token URL**: Used by the client to exchange an authorization code for an access token and a refresh token.
- **User Info URL**: Used by the client to retrieve additional user data upon authentication.

## Get additional user information with the OAuth 2.0 flow

After a user has successfully completed an OAuth 2.0 flow, you can retrieve additional user information from Clerk's [`/oauth/userinfo`](/docs/reference/frontend-api/tag/OAuth2-Identify-Provider#operation/getOAuthUserInfo){{ target: '_blank' }} endpoint. When making the request to this endpoint, you must include the Clerk access token in the `Authorization` header.

The `/oauth/userinfo` endpoint provides the following user properties, depending on the granted scopes:

| Property | Description |
| - | - |
| `user_id` | The ID of the user |
| `sub` | The ID of the user |
| `given_name` | The user's first name |
| `family_name` | The user's last name |
| `name` | The user's full name |
| `picture` | The user's avatar URL |
| `preferred_username` | The user's username |
| `email` | The user's primary email address |
| `email_verified` | Whether the user's primary email address is verified |
| `public_metadata` | The user's public metadata |
| `private_metadata` | The user's private metadata |
| `unsafe_metadata` | The user's unsafe metadata |

### Get token information

For validating access tokens or refresh tokens and retrieving additional token metadata, Clerk provides a standard OAuth 2.0 [Token Introspection Endpoint](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/token-introspection-endpoint/) at [`/oauth/token_info`](/docs/reference/frontend-api/tag/OAuth2-Identify-Provider#operation/getOAuthTokenInfo){{ target: '_blank' }}.

The endpoint returns detailed token information such as if the token is still active, the client ID, and the granted scopes.

> [!WARNING]
> This endpoint is protected. You must provide your Clerk Client ID and Client Secret credentials to authenticate.

### Grant types

Clerk's OAuth 2.0 IdP implementation supports the following authorization flows and grant types:

- [Authorization Code](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/)
- [PKCE](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/)
- [Refresh token](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/refresh-token/)

### Get additional user information with the OAuth 2.0 flow using OpenID Connect (OIDC)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Not all third-party apps expect or use OIDC. However, this feature was designed with OIDC compatibility in mind, which is why it's included in this guide. Make sure your integration target supports OIDC before proceeding

After a user successfully authenticates using the OIDC flow, they automatically receive an ID token along with other tokens.

The ID token is a JWT (JSON Web Token) that contains standard JWT claims as defined in RFC 7519, as well as additional custom claims that represent the authenticated user's profile information. The token is signed using your instance's private key.

You must validate the ID token before using any of the user information it contains. Validation requires verifying the token signature using your instance's public key. You can find your instance's public key at `https://clerk.<INSERT_YOUR_APP_DOMAIN>.com/.well-known/jwks.json`.

The ID token includes the following standard claims:

| Standard claim | Description |
| - | - |
| `iss` | The issuer of the token, which matches your Clerk Frontend API URL |
| `sub` | The subject of the token, which matches the authenticated user ID |
| `aud` | The intended audience of the token, which matches the used Client ID |
| `exp` | The expiration time of the token |
| `iat` | The time at which the token was issued |
| `jti` | A unique identifier for the token |

Depending on the granted scopes, the ID token can include the following additional claims:

| Additional claim | Description |
| - | - |
| `nonce` | The nonce provided and used during the request |
| `family_name` | The user's last name |
| `given_name` | The user's first name |
| `name` | The user's full name |
| `picture` | The user's avatar URL |
| `preferred_username` | The user's username |
| `email` | The user's primary email address |
| `email_verified` | Whether the user's primary email address is verified |
| `public_metadata` | The user's public metadata |
| `private_metadata` | The user's private metadata |
| `unsafe_metadata` | The user's unsafe metadata |

### OIDC prompt

As part of an OIDC request, you can indicate the desired sign-in experience for the user by using the `prompt` parameter. The following values are supported:

- `none`: The user doesn't interact with the provider, thus they need to have an active session already. If not, the provider responds with an error.
- `login`: The user is forced to re-authenticate, even if they already have an active session. If there was already an active session, the provider ends it.
