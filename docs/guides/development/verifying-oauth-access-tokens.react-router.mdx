When building a resource server that needs to accept and verify [OAuth access tokens](!oauth-access-token) issued by Clerk, it's crucial to verify these tokens on your backend to ensure the request is coming from an authenticated client.

<Include src="_partials/machine-token-pricing-callout" />

Clerk provides a built-in [`getAuth()`](/docs/reference/react-router/get-auth) function that supports token validation via the `acceptsToken` parameter. This lets you specify which type(s) of token your API route should accept in your React Router app.

By default, `acceptsToken` is set to `session_token`, which means OAuth tokens will **not** be accepted unless explicitly configured. You can pass either a **single token type** or an **array of token types** to `acceptsToken`. To learn more about the supported token types, see the [`getAuth()` parameters documentation](/docs/reference/react-router/get-auth#parameters).

## Example 1: Accepting a single token type

In the following example, the `acceptsToken` parameter is set to only accept `oauth_token`s.

- If the token is invalid or missing, `auth()` will return `null` for `subject` and other properties, and the request will be rejected with a `401` response.
- If the token is valid, it returns the authenticated user's subject and their associated scopes for use in the application logic.

```tsx
import { getAuth } from '@clerk/react-router/server'
import type { Route } from './+types/profile'

export async function loader(args: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const { subject, scopes } = await getAuth(args, { acceptsToken: 'oauth_token' })

  // If getAuth() returns null, the token is invalid
  if (!subject) {
    throw new Response('OAuth access token is invalid', { status: 401 })
  }

  return { subject, scopes }
}
```

## Example 2: Accepting any token type

In the following example, the `acceptsToken` parameter is set to accept any token type.

- If the token is a `session_token`, it logs that the request is from a user session.
- Otherwise, it logs that the request uses a machine token and specifies its type.

```tsx
import { getAuth } from '@clerk/react-router/server'
import type { Route } from './+types/profile'

export async function loader(args: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const { tokenType } = await getAuth(args, { acceptsToken: 'any' })

  if (tokenType === 'session_token') {
    console.log('This is a session token from a user')
  } else {
    console.log(`This is a ${tokenType} token`)
  }

  return { tokenType }
}
```
