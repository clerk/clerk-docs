> [!WARNING]
> The React Router SDK is currently in beta.

The Clerk React Router SDK is built on top of the [React SDK](/docs/references/react/overview) and is the recommended method for integrating Clerk into your React Router application.

## Client-side helpers

The React Router SDK provides hooks that give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object and helper methods for authentication flows. See the [React SDK reference](/docs/references/react/overview) for details.

## Server-side helpers

The following references show how to integrate Clerk features into applications using React Router server functions and API routes.

- [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/react-router/get-auth)
- [`rootAuthLoader()`](/docs/references/react-router/root-auth-loader)

### `Auth` object

The `getAuth()` method returns an `Auth` object. This JavaScript object contains important information like the current user's session ID, user ID, and organization ID. Learn more about the [`Auth` object](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }}.

## React Router implementations

React Router can be integrated with Clerk in two ways:

- As a framework (recommended): Configure your app using [Clerk's React Router SDK](/docs/quickstarts/react-router)
- As a library: Manually integrate React Router into your React + Vite app using [library mode](/docs/references/react-router/library-mode)
