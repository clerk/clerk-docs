The Account Portal in Clerk is a powerful feature that allows you to streamline the sign-in, sign-up, and profile management experience for your users, without having to build your own components or host your own pages.

## Why use the Account Portal?

The Account Portal provides the pages necessary for your users to sign-up, sign-in, and manage their accounts, all while maintaining seamless integration with your application. These pages are hosted on Clerk servers for you and they require minimal setup to get started. If you're looking for the fastest way to add authentication and user management to your application, then this is a great choice.

However, if you require more precise customization or prefer having your application self-contained, then you can use Clerk's fully customizable [prebuilt components](/docs/reference/components/overview), or you can build your own [custom user interface using the Clerk API](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview).

## How the Account Portal works

The Account Portal uses Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/reference/components/overview), which are embedded into dedicated pages hosted on Clerk servers.

![Account Portal](/docs/images/account-portal/account_portal_how_it_works.png)

After a user has finished their flow in an Account Portal page, Clerk automatically redirects them back to your application along with the required authentication context. This way, users are automatically redirected to and from your application for a seamless experience.

For each application environment, Clerk provides pages for sign-up, sign-in, user profile, organization profile, and organization creation flow. To integrate the Account Portal into your application, simply embed a Clerk component into your application and Clerk will automatically redirect your users to the Account Portal pages. For example, the [`<SignUpButton>`](/docs/reference/components/unstyled/sign-up-button) and [`<SignInButton>`](/docs/reference/components/unstyled/sign-in-button) components will redirect users to the Account Portal sign-up and sign-in pages if no props or [environment variables](/docs/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) are configured to override this behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> **Dynamic Development Host Detection**
>
> For development environments, the development host (e.g. [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) is dynamically detected by Clerk at runtime and tied to your client browser. We store this as the ‘home origin’ for your application and it is equivalent to your application domain in production environments.

### Accessing your pages

For development environments, Clerk will issue you a randomly generated domain on "accounts.dev". In production, by default, the URLs for your Account Portal are the following:

```sh
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/sign-in
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/sign-up
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/user
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/unauthorized-sign-in
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/organization
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/create-organization
```

To access these links, in the Clerk Dashboard, go to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/account-portal) page and then open the **Pages** tab.

### Customizing your pages

These pages cannot be customized beyond the options provided in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com). If you need more customization such as [localization](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/localization), consider using [prebuilt components](/docs/reference/components/overview) or building your own [custom user interface](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview).

### Disabling the Account Portal

> [!CAUTION]
> We recommend leaving the Account Portal enabled, even if you do choose to set up your own authentication flow. This helps with testing as well as providing an alternative path for users when needed.

To disable the Account Portal:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/account-portal) page.
1. Select **Disable Account Portal** on the right-side. You will not be able to select this button until you have [set up an authentication flow for your users](#handle-clerk-flows), as applying this setting will immediately result in a 404 for all Account Portal pages.

#### Handle Clerk flows

Once you have disabled the Account Portal, you are fully responsible for providing your own flows, such as sign-up and sign-in. Clerk provides a set of [prebuilt components](/docs/reference/components/overview) that you can use. If prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. See the [custom flows](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview) guides for more information. **It's highly recommended that even if you use either of these options, you keep the Account Portal enabled for testing purposes and as a fallback for users.**

### Linking to Account Portal pages

If a user accesses an Account Portal page _directly_, the `redirect_url` query param will not be present, so the user cannot be redirected back to your application once they are finished with their Account Portal flow. To prevent this, it is recommend that you always specify the redirect in the link when sharing it.

You can use the following format for your direct links:

`https://accounts.<your-domain.com>/<account-portal-page>?redirect_url=<your-redirect-url>`

**Example**

`https://accounts.myapp.com/sign-in?redirect_url=https://myapp.com/dashboard`

The domain is `myapp.com`, the user is being linked to the sign-in Account Portal page at `http://accounts.myapp.com/sign-in` and they will be redirected to `https://myapp.com/dashboard` after they are signed in.

#### Fallback redirects

In the case that a user _does_ visit an Account Portal page directly without the query param, you can set up fallback redirects to ensure that the user is redirected back to your application after they are finished with their Account Portal flow.

- Sign-up and sign-in: Set the appropriate [environment variables](/docs/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) to configure the fallback redirects for sign-in and sign-up.
- Sign out: Set the post-sign-out redirect by passing the `afterSignOutUrl` prop to the `<ClerkProvider>` component. See the [reference doc](/docs/reference/components/clerk-provider) for more information.
- Organization redirects: Both the `<OrganizationProfile />` and `<OrganizationSwitcher />` components accept an `afterLeaveOrganizationUrl` prop for setting the redirect after leaving an Organization. The `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component accepts an `afterSelectOrganizationUrl` prop for setting the redirect after selecting an Organization, and an `afterCreateOrganizationUrl` prop for setting the redirect after creating an Organization.
- Prefill sign-up and sign-in fields: Can be specified via the following query parameters: `email_address`, `phone_number`, `username`, `first_name`, and `last_name`. For example, visiting `https://accounts.example.com/sign-in?username=nick` will result in the username field being prefilled with the value `nick`.
