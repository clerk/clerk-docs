title: Clerk environment variables
description: Learn which Clerk environment variables are necessary to configure your projects.
---

You can use environment variables to configure how your Clerk app behaves, such as where users are redirected after signing out of their account, or whether or not Clerk's telemetry should be enabled.

This page is a reference for all available Clerk environment variables.

## Compatibility

In the frontend, Clerk's environment variables work for most popular meta-frameworks, such as Next.js or Remix.

If you're building a pure React app, you should use the props on the components you're using. For example, to force users to redirect to a specific URL after signing in, you would use the `signInForceRedirectUrl` prop on [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/reference/components/clerk-provider) rather than the `CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL` environment variable.

## Sign-in and sign-up redirects

Components, such as [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/reference/components/clerk-provider), [`<SignIn>`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in), and more, provide props for you to specify where users will be redirected. For example, `<ClerkProvider>` has the `signInFallbackRedirectUrl` and `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl` props.

However, **it's recommended to use environment variables instead of these props whenever possible.**

## Clerk Publishable and Secret Keys

To access your Clerk app in your local project, you must specify your app's Publishable Keys for use in the frontend, and Secret Keys for use in the backend.

You can find these keys on the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

<Tabs items={["General", "Next.js"]}>
  <Tab>
    | Variable | Description |
    | - | - |
    | `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Your Clerk app's Publishable Key. It will be prefixed with `pk_test_` in development instances and `pk_live_` in production instances. |
    | `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Your Clerk app's Secret Key, which you can find in the Clerk Dashboard. It will be prefixed with `sk_test_` in development instances and `sk_live_` in production instances. **Do not expose this on the frontend with a public environment variable**. |
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    | Variable | Description |
    | - | - |
    | `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Your Clerk app's Publishable Key, which you can find in the Clerk Dashboard. It will be prefixed with `pk_test_` in development instances and `pk_live_` in production instances. |
    | `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Your Clerk app's Secret Key, which you can find in the Clerk Dashboard. It will be prefixed with `sk_test_` in development instances and `sk_live_` in production instances. **Do not expose this on the frontend with a public environment variable**. |

## API and SDK configuration

The following environment variables enable you to configure API and SDK behavior, such as what version of the SDK your project uses, what proxy URL you use to connect to Clerk's Frontend API, and more.

## Satellite domains

Clerk supports sharing sessions across different domains by adding one or many satellite domains to an application. See [the satellite domains guide](/docs/guides/dashboard/dns-domains/satellite-domains) for more information.

<Tabs items={["General", "Next.js"]}>
  <Tab>
    | Variable | Description |
    | - | - |
    | `CLERK_DOMAIN` | Sets your satellite application's domain. Required to share sessions across multiple domains. |
