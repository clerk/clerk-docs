# Customize your session token

Session tokens are JWTs generated by Clerk on behalf of your instance, and convey an authenticated user session to your backend.

By default, session tokens contain claims that are required for Clerk to function. You can learn more about these "default claims" in the [session tokens](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens) documentation.

This guide will show you how to customize a session token to include additional claims that you may need in your application.

<Callout type="danger">
  The entire session token has a max size of 4kb. Exceeding this size can have adverse effects, including a possible infinite redirect loop for users who exceed this size on Next applications.
</Callout>

{/* TODO: Update the H3 to an H2 when the Steps component can accept headings other than H3. */}

<Steps>

### Add custom claims to your session token

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=sessions) and select your application.
2. In the navigation sidebar, select **Sessions**.
3. In the **Customize your session token** section, click the **Edit** button.
4. In the modal that opens, you can add any claim to your session token that you need.

The following example adds the `fullName` and `primaryEmail` claims to the session token.

### Use the custom claims in your application

The [`Auth`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object) object in the `@clerk/nextjs` package includes a `sessionClaims` property that contains the custom claims you added to your session token.

Access the custom claims in your application by calling `auth()` in App Router applications or `getAuth(req)` in Pages Router applications.

The following example demonstrates how to access the `fullName` and `primaryEmail` claims that were added to the session token in the last step.

<CodeBlockTabs type="router" options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export default function Page() {
  const { sessionClaims } = auth();

  const firstName = sessionClaims?.fullName;

  const primaryEmail = sessionClaims?.primaryEmail;

  return NextResponse.json({ firstName, primaryEmail })
}
```

```tsx filename="pages/api/example.ts"
import { getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const { sessionClaims } = getAuth(req);

  const firstName = sessionClaims.fullName;

  const primaryEmail = sessionClaims.primaryEmail;

  return res.status(200).json({ firstName, primaryEmail })
}
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Add global TypeScript type for custom session claims

To get auto-complete and prevent TypeScript errors when working with custom session claims, you can define a global type.

1. In your application's root folder, add a `types` directory.
2. Inside of the `types` directory, add a `globals.d.ts` file.
3. Create the `CustomJwtSessionClaims` interface and declare it globally.
4. Add the custom claims to the `CustomJwtSessionClaims` interface.

The following example demonstrates how to add the `firstName` and `primaryEmail` claims to the `CustomJwtSessionClaims` interface.

```tsx filename="types/globals.d.ts"
export { };

declare global {
  interface CustomJwtSessionClaims {
    firstName?: string;
    primaryEmail?: string;
  }
}
```

</Steps>
