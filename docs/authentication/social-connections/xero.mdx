  - Use Bitbucket to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with Bitbucket allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Bitbucket account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Bitbucket**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Bitbucket workspace](https://bitbucket.org).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Bitbucket as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Bitbucket**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Callback URL** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Create a Bitbucket workspace

  1. On the [Bitbucket workspaces homepage](https://bitbucket.org/account/workspaces/), select **Create workspace**. Follow the necessary steps.
  1. Once you've created your workspace, you'll be redirected the workspace's overview page. In the top-right, select the settings icon. Then, select **Workspace settings**.
  1. In the left sidebar, select **OAuth consumers**.
  1. Select **Add consumer**. You'll be redirected to the **Add OAuth consumer** page.
  1. Fill out the necessary information. In the **Callback URL** field, paste the **Callback URL** value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard. Under **Permissions**, under **Account**, select **Read**. These are the scopes that Clerk needs to access your Bitbucket account.
  1. Select **Save**.
  1. Select the consumer you just created. It should reveal a **Key** and **Secret**. Save these somewhere secure.

  ### Set the Key and Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open. Paste the **Key** and **Secret** values that you saved into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the values into their respective fields.

  ### Test your connection
