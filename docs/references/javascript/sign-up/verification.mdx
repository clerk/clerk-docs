These are all methods on the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) class that allow you to verify a user's sign-up request.

## `prepareVerification()`

The `prepareVerification` is used to initiate the verification process for a field that requires it. As mentioned above, there are two fields that need to be verified:

- `emailAddress`: The email address can be verified via an email code. This is a one-time code that is sent to the email already provided to the SignUp object. The `prepareVerification` sends this email.
- `phoneNumber`: The phone number can be verified via a phone code. This is a one-time code that is sent via an SMS to the phone already provided to the SignUp object. The `prepareVerification` sends this SMS.

```typescript
function prepareVerification(params: PrepareVerificationParams): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

### `PrepareVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'phone_code' | 'email_code' | 'email_link' | 'oauth_<provider>' | 'saml' | 'enterprise_sso' | 'web3_metamask_signature' | 'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature' | 'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`

  The verification strategy to validate the user's sign-up request. The following strategies are supported:

  - `'phone_code'`: User will receive a one-time authentication code via SMS.
  - `'email_code'`: Send an email with a unique token to input.
  - `'email_link'`: Send an email with a link which validates sign-up.
  - `'oauth_<provider>'`: The user will be authenticated with their [social connection account](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview). [See a list of supported values for `<provider>`](/docs/references/javascript/types/oauth#o-auth-provider).
  - `'saml'` (deprecated): **Deprecated in favor of `'enterprise_sso'`.** The user will be authenticated with their [SAML account](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/overview#saml).
  - `'enterprise_sso'`: The user will be authenticated either through SAML or OIDC depending on the configuration of their [enterprise SSO account](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/overview).
  - `'web3_metamask_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). The `web3_wallet_id` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known Web3 wallets will be used.
  - `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet). The `web3_wallet_id` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known Web3 wallets will be used.
  - `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [OKX Wallet](https://www.okx.com/help/section/faq-web3-wallet). The `web3_wallet_id` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known Web3 wallets will be used.

  - `redirectUrl`
  - `string`

  If `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`, this specifies the full URL or path that the OAuth provider should redirect to after successful authorization. Typically, this will be a simple `/sso-callback` route that either calls [`Clerk.handleRedirectCallback`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/handle-navigation#handle-redirect-callback) or mounts the [`<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />`](/docs/components/control/authenticate-with-callback) component. See the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/oauth-connections) for implementation details.

  If `strategy` is set to `'email_link'`, this specifies The full URL that the user will be redirected to when they visit the email link. See the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/email-links) for implementation details.

  ---

  - `actionCompleteRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The full URL or path that the user will be redirected to after successful authorization from the OAuth provider and Clerk sign-in.

  ---

  - `oidcPrompt?`
  - `string`

  **Optional** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The value to pass to the [OIDC `prompt` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=prompt,reauthentication%20and%20consent) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.

  ---

  - `oidcLoginHint?`
  - `string`

  **Optional** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The value to pass to the [OIDC `login_hint` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=login_hint,in%20\(if%20necessary\).) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.
</Properties>

## `attemptVerification()`

Attempts to complete the in-flight verification process that corresponds to the given strategy. In order to use this method, you should first initiate a verification process by calling [SignUp.prepareVerification](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/verification#prepare-verification).

Depending on the strategy, the method parameters could differ.

```typescript
function attemptVerification(params: AttemptVerificationParams): Promise<SignUp>
```

### `AttemptVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'phone_code' | 'email_code' | 'web3_metamask_signature' | 'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature' | 'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`

  The verification strategy to complete the user's sign-up request against. The following strategies are supported:

  - `'phone_code'`: Validates an SMS with a unique token to input.
  - `'email_code'`: Validates an email with a unique token to input.
  - `'web3_metamask_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). The `web3_wallet_id` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known Web3 wallets will be used.
  - `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet). The `web3_wallet_id` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known Web3 wallets will be used.

The `web3_wallet_id` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known Web3 wallets will be used.
