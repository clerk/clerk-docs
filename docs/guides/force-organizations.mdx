# Hide personal accounts and force organizations

In this guide, you will learn how to hide a user's "personal account" in order to appear as if they only have an organization account. This is useful for applications that are built for organizations only, such as B2B applications.

This guide will be written for Next.js applications using App Router, but the same concepts can be applied to any application using Clerk.

<Steps>

### Hide personal accounts from UI components

To begin forcing organizations in your application, you need to remove a user's personal account from the UI. A user's personal account cannot be disabled; it can only be hidden. 

If you have an application set up to use organizations, you might have the [`<OrganizationList />`](/docs/components/organization/organization-list) and [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/components/organization/organization-switcher) components in your application. These components will show a user's personal account by default, but you can hide it by passing the `hidePersonal` prop.

<Tabs items={["<OrganizationList />", "<OrganizationSwitcher />"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```tsx filename="app/organization-list/[[...organization-list]]/page.tsx" {6}
    import { OrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    export default function OrganizationListPage() {
      return (
        <OrganizationList
          hidePersonal={true}
        />
      );
    };
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```tsx filename="app/sidebar.tsx" {5}
    import { OrganizationSwitcher } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    export default function Sidebar() {
      return (
        <OrganizationSwitcher
          hidePersonal={true}
        />
      );
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Detect and set an active organization

With Clerk, a user can have many organization memberships, but only one of them can be active at a time. 

#### Detect an active organization

A session will always include an `organizationId` via the [`Authentication` object](/docs/references/nextjs/authentication-object#example-with-active-organization). This can be used to detect if a user has an active organization.

<Tabs items={["App Router Server Component", "App Router Client Component"]}>
  <Tab>

    The [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) helper function can be used to get the `organizationId` from the session *server-side*. If the `organizationId` is `null`, then the user does not have an active organization.

    ```tsx
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default function Layout() {
      const { orgId } = auth();

      const hasActiveOrg = orgId !== null;
      ...
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>

    The [`useAuth()`](/docs/references/react/use-auth) hook can be used to get the `organizationId` from the session *client-side*. If the `organizationId` is `null`, then the user does not have an active organization.
  
    ```tsx
    "use client"
    import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    export default function Layout() {
      const { orgId } = useAuth();

      const hasActiveOrg = orgId !== null;
      ...
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Set an active organization

In the case of [Clerk components](/docs/components/overview), an organization will *automatically* be set as active each time the user creates an organization, accepts an invitation, or selects a membership from the organization switcher. In the case of custom flows, you will need to provide the logic for setting an organization as active. Don't worry, Clerk's [`useOrganizationList`](/docs/hooks/use-organization-list) hook provides a [`setActive`](/docs/references/react/use-organization-list) helper function to help you with this.

In the example below, a custom organization switcher is created. It allows a user to select an organization from a list of their memberships. The `useOrganizationList()` hook is used to fetch a list of the user's memberships, and the `setActive` helper function is used to set the selected organization as active.

<Callout type="warning">
  Setting an active organization can only be performed client-side.
</Callout>

```tsx filename="app/custom-org-switcher.tsx"
"use client"

import { useOrganizationList } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import React from "react";
 
export const CustomOrgSwitcher = () => {
  const { isLoaded, setActive, userMemberships } = useOrganizationList({
    userMemberships: {
      infinite: true,
    },
  });
 
  if (!isLoaded) {
    return <>Loading</>;
  }
 
  return (
    <>
      <ul>
        {userMemberships.data?.map((mem) => (
          <li key={mem.id}>
            <span>{mem.organization.name}</span>
            <button
              onClick={() => setActive({ organization: mem.organization.id })}
            >
              Select
            </button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
 
      <button
        disabled={!userMemberships.hasNextPage}
        onClick={() => userMemberships.fetchNext()}
      >
        Load more
      </button>
    </>
  );
};

```

#### Set an active organization based on the URL

In some cases, you might want to set an active organization based on the URL. For example, if you have a URL like `/organizations/org_123`, you might want to set `org_123` as the active organization. In this case, you can use Next.js's [`useParams()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-params) hook to get the organization ID from the URL, and then use the `setActive` helper function to set the organization as active.

```tsx filename="app/utils/sync-active-organization.tsx"
"use client"

import { useEffect } from "react"
import { redirect, useParams } from "next/navigation"
import { useAuth, useOrganizationList } from "@clerk/nextjs"

export function SyncActiveOrganization() {
  const { setActive, isLoaded } = useOrganizationList()

  // Get the organization ID from the session
  const { orgId } = useAuth()

  // Get the organization ID from the URL
  const { orgId: urlOrgId } = useParams() as { orgId: string }

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isLoaded) return

    // If the org ID in the URL is not valid, redirect to the homepage
    if (!urlOrgId?.startsWith("org_")) {
      redirect("/")
      return
    }

    // If the org ID in the URL is not the same as the org ID in the session (the active organization), set the active organization to be the org ID from the URL
    if (urlOrgId && urlOrgId !== orgId) {
      void setActive({ organization: urlOrgId })
    }
  }, [orgId, isLoaded, setActive, urlOrgId])

  return null
}
```

### Limit access to users with active organizations only

Now that you have hidden personal accounts from the UI and can detect and set an active organization, you can limit access to users with active organizations only.

It's possible for a user to be logged in, but not have an active organization. This can happen in two cases:
  - The user created an account and hasn't created an organization yet
  - The user joined or created multiple organizations, and left or deleted the active organization

Based on your use case, you can decide to limit users either in the entire app or a specific part of it. For example, a B2B application might need to limit access to only users with an active organization, whereas a B2B2C application might limit only the `/dashboard` path to users with an active organization.

#### Limit the entire application to only users with active organizations

In Next.js App Router applications, you can use a [layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts) to limit the entire application to only users with active organizations.

In the example below, a component called `RequiredActiveOrgLayout` is created. This component will be used as a layout for all pages that require an active organization. If the user has an active organization, the children will be rendered. If the user does not have an active organization, the organization selection page will be rendered.

```tsx filename="app/(with-active-organization)/layout.tsx"
  import { OrganizationList } from "@clerk/nextjs"
  import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server"
  import { PropsWithChildren } from "react"

  export default function RequiredActiveOrgLayout(props: PropsWithChildren) {
    // Get the organization ID from the session
    const { orgId } = auth()

    // If the user has an active organization, render the children
    if (orgId) {
      return props.children
    }

    // If the user does not have an active organization, render the organization selection page
    return (
      <section>
        <h1>Welcome to the Organization Selection page.</h1>
        <p>
          This part of the application requires the user to select an
          organization in order to proceed. If you are not part of an
          organization, you can accept an invitation or create your own
          organization.
        </p>
        <OrganizationList hidePersonal={true} />
      </section>
    )
  }
```

In Next.js Pages Router applications, Clerk's [`authMiddleware`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware) helper can be used to limit the entire application to only user's with an active organization.

This following example will show you how to configure the [`authMiddleware`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware) helper to redirect users to the `/org-selection` page if they are not active in an organization.

<Tabs items={["Middleware", "Organization Selection page"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
    import { authMiddleware, redirectToSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs';

    export default authMiddleware({
      afterAuth(auth, req, evt) {
        ...
        // Redirect logged in users to organization selection page if they are not active in an organization
        if(auth.userId && !auth.orgId && req.nextUrl.pathname !== "/org-selection"){
          const searchParams = new URLSearchParams({
            redirectUrl: req.url
          })

          const orgSelection = new URL(`/org-selection?${searchParams.toString()}`, req.url);

          return NextResponse.redirect(orgSelection)
        }
        ...
      }
    });
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```tsx filename="pages/org-selection.tsx"
    import { OrganizationList } from "@clerk/nextjs"
    import { useRouter } from "next/router";

    export default function OrganizationSelection() {
      const { query } = useRouter();

      return (
        <section>
          <h1>Welcome to the Organization Selection page.</h1>
          <p>
            This part of the application requires the user to select an
            organization in order to proceed. If you are not part of an
            organization, you can accept an invitation or create your own
            organization.
          </p>
          <OrganizationList
            hidePersonal={true}
            afterCreateOrganizationUrl={query.redirectUrl ?? "/"}
            afterSelectOrganizationUrl={query.redirectUrl ?? "/"}
          />
        </section>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
