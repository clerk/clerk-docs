[Sign in with Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/12849458?hl=en) helps you easily and securely sign in to third-party apps or services with your Google Account, without having to enter a username and password repeatedly across different services.

This guide will teach you how to add native Sign in with Google to your Clerk Expo application. This is different from Google OAuth - if you want to use Google OAuth, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/google).

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open - one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

<Steps>
  ## Enable Google as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Google**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Authorized Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ## Configure Google Cloud Console

  Before you can use Google Sign-In in your app, you need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials in the Google Cloud Console.

  ### Create a Google Cloud Project

  1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  1. Select an existing project or [create a new one](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate). You'll be redirected to your project's **Dashboard** page.
  1. Enable the **Google+ API** for your project.

  ### Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

  You'll need to create three sets of credentials:

  #### Web Client ID (for token verification)

  1. Navigate to **APIs & Services**. Then, select **Credentials**.
  1. Next to **Credentials**, select **Create Credentials**. Then, select **OAuth client ID**. You might need to [configure your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849#userconsent). Otherwise, you'll be redirected to the **Create OAuth client ID** page.
  1. For the **Application type**, select **Web application**.
  1. Add a name (e.g., "Web client for token verification").
  1. Select **Create**. A modal will open with your **Client ID**. 
  1. Copy and save the **Client ID** - you'll need this for `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID`.

  #### iOS Client ID

  1. In the same project, create another client. Next to **Credentials**, select **Create Credentials**. Then, select **OAuth client ID**.
  1. For the **Application type**, select **iOS**.
  1. Add your iOS **Bundle ID** (from your `app.json` or `app.config.ts`).
  1. Select **Create**. A modal will open with your **Client ID**. 
  1. Copy ans save the **Client ID** - you'll need this for `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID`.

  #### Android Client ID

  1. In the same project, create another client. Next to **Credentials**, select **Create Credentials**. Then, select **OAuth client ID**.
  1. For the **Application type**, select **Android**.
  1. Complete the required fields:
     - **Package name**: Your package name is in your `app.json` or `app.config.ts`.
     - **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint**: To get your SHA-1, run the following command in your terminal:

       ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
       $ keytool -keystore path-to-debug-or-production-keystore -list -v
       ```

       > [!NOTE]
       > Replace `path-to-debug-or-production-keystore` with the path to your debug or production keystore. By default, the debug keystore is located in `~/.android/debug.keystore`. It may ask for a keystore password, which is `android`. **Please note that Java is required to run the `keytool` command.**
  1. Select **Create**. A modal will open with your **Client ID**.
  1. Copy and save the **Client ID** - you'll need this for `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID`.

  ## Add your iOS application to Clerk

  Add your iOS application to the [**Native Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/native-applications) page in the Clerk Dashboard. You will need your iOS app's **App ID Prefix** (Team ID) and **Bundle ID**.

  ## Add your Android application to Clerk

  Add your Android application to the [**Native Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/native-applications) page in the Clerk Dashboard. You will need your Android app's **package name**.

  ## Configure environment variables

  Add the Google OAuth client IDs to your `.env` file:

  ```bash {{ filename: '.env' }}
  EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=your-web-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
  EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID=your-ios-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
  EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID=your-android-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com

  # iOS only: URL scheme for Google Sign-In callback
  # Format: com.googleusercontent.apps.{IOS_CLIENT_ID_PREFIX}
  EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_GOOGLE_IOS_URL_SCHEME=com.googleusercontent.apps.your-ios-client-id
  ```

  ## Configure the Clerk Expo plugin (iOS only)

  > [!NOTE]
  > The `@clerk/clerk-expo` config plugin is **optional** and only required if you're using native Google Sign-In on iOS. It configures the URL scheme needed for Google's authentication callback. Android does not require this configuration.

  Add the `@clerk/clerk-expo` plugin to your `app.json` or `app.config.ts`:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["app.json", "app.config.ts"]}>
    ```json {{ filename: 'app.json' }}
    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": ["@clerk/clerk-expo"],
        "extra": {
          "EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_GOOGLE_IOS_URL_SCHEME": "com.googleusercontent.apps.your-ios-client-id"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ```ts {{ filename: 'app.config.ts' }}
    export default {
      expo: {
        plugins: ['@clerk/clerk-expo'],
        extra: {
          EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_GOOGLE_IOS_URL_SCHEME: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_GOOGLE_IOS_URL_SCHEME,
        },
      },
    }
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  The plugin resolves the `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_GOOGLE_IOS_URL_SCHEME` value from either of the following:

  1. An environment variable (recommended for EAS builds, configured in `eas.json`).
  1. The `config.extra` field in your app config.

  For EAS builds, add the environment variable to your build profile in `eas.json`:

  ```json {{ filename: 'eas.json' }}
  {
    "build": {
      "development": {
        "env": {
          "EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_GOOGLE_IOS_URL_SCHEME": "com.googleusercontent.apps.your-ios-client-id"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ## Build your authentication flow

  <Include src="_partials/expo/use-sign-in-with-google-example" />

  ## Create a native build

  Create a native build with EAS Build or a local prebuild, since Google Authentication is not supported in Expo Go.

  ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  # Using EAS Build
  eas build --platform ios
  eas build --platform android

  # Or using local prebuild
  npx expo prebuild && npx expo run:ios --device
  npx expo prebuild && npx expo run:android --device
  ```
</Steps>
