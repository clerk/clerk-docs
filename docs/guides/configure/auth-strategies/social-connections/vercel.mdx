Enabling OAuth with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/sign-in-with-vercel) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Vercel account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Vercel**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Vercel team settings](https://vercel.com/account).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Vercel as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and choose **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Vercel**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Authorization Callback URL** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create a Vercel app

  1. In your [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com), navigate to your team's **Settings** tab.
  1. Scroll down and select **Apps**, then select **Create**.
  1. Enter a **Name** and **Slug** for your app. Optionally, upload a logo.
  1. Select **Save**.
  1. Save the **Client ID** somewhere secure.
  1. Scroll to **Authorization Callback URLs** and add the Authorization Callback URL you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Navigate to the **Authentication** tab and under **Client Authentication Methods**, select the appropriate method for your app. For server-side applications, `client_secret_basic` or `client_secret_post` are recommended.
  1. Navigate to the **Permissions** tab and enable the required scopes: `openid`, `email`, `profile`, and `offline_access`.
  1. Select **Generate** to create a client secret. Save the **Client Secret** somewhere secure.
  1. Select **Save**.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard
