title: '`useReverification()`'
description: Clerk's useReverification() hook enhances a fetcher function to handle a session's reverification flow.
---

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is currently in public beta. **It is not recommended for production use**.
>
> Depending on the SDK you're using, this feature requires `@clerk/nextjs@6.5.0` or later, `@clerk/clerk-react@5.17.0` or later, and `@clerk/clerk-js@5.35.0` or later.

The `useReverification()` hook is used to handle a session's reverification flow. If a request requires reverification, a modal will display, prompting the user to verify their credentials. Upon successful verification, the original request will automatically retry.

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `fetcher`
  - `Fetcher extends (...args: any[]) => Promise<any>`

  The fetcher function.

  ---

  - `options?`
  - [`UseReverificationOptions`](#use-reverification-options)

  The optional options object.
</Properties>

### `UseReverificationOptions`

<Properties>
  - `onCancel?`
  - `() â‡’ void`

  A callback function that is invoked when the user cancels the reverification process.

  ---

  - `throwOnCancel?`
  - `boolean`

  Determines if an error should throw when the user cancels the reverification process. Defaults to `false`.
</Properties>

## Returns

The `useReverification()` hook returns an array with the "enhanced" fetcher.

## How to use the `useReverification()` hook

### Handle cancellation of the reverification process

The following example demonstrates how to handle scenarios where a user cancels the reverification flow, such as closing the modal, which might result in `myData` being `null`.

In this example, `myFetcher` would be a function in your backend that fetches data from the route that requires reverification. See the [guide on how to require reverification](/docs/guides/reverification) for more information.

```tsx {{ filename: 'MyButton.tsx' }}
import { useReverification } from '@clerk/react'

export function MyButton() {
  const [enhancedFetcher] = useReverification(myFetcher)

  const handleClick = async () => {
    const myData = await enhancedFetcher()
    // If `myData` is null, the user canceled the reverification process
    // You can choose how your app responds. This example returns null.
    if (!myData) return
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Update User</button>
}
```

### Handle `throwOnCancel`

When `throwOnCancel` is set to `true`, the fetcher will throw a `ClerkRuntimeError` with the code `"reverification_cancelled"` if the user cancels the reverification flow (for example, by closing the modal). This error can be caught and handled according to your app's needs. For example, by displaying a toast notification to the user or silently ignoring the cancellation.

In this example, `myFetcher` would be a function in your backend that fetches data from the route that requires reverification. See the [guide on how to require reverification](/docs/guides/reverification) for more information.

```tsx {{ filename: 'MyButton.tsx' }}
import { useReverification } from '@clerk/clerk-react'
import { isClerkRuntimeError } from '@clerk/clerk-react/errors'

export function MyButton() {
  const [enhancedFetcher] = useReverification(myFetcher, { throwOnCancel: true })

  const handleClick = async () => {
    try {
      const myData = await enhancedFetcher()
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle if user cancels the reverification process
      if (isClerkRuntimeError(e) && e.code === 'reverification_cancelled') {
        console.error('User cancelled reverification', e.code)
      }
    }
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Update user</button>
}
```
