## Methods

### `create()`

Creates a new `SignUp` instance initialized with the provided parameters. The instance maintains the sign-up lifecycle state through its `status` property, which updates as the authentication flow progresses. Will also deactivate any existing sign-up process the client may already have in progress.

What you must pass to `params` depends on which [sign-up options](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options) you have enabled in your app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `signUp.create()` method is intended for advanced use cases. For most use cases, prefer the use of the factor-specific methods such as `signUp.password()`, `signUp.sso()`, etc.

> [!WARNING]
> Once the sign-up process is complete, call the `signUp.finalize()` method to set the newly created session as the active session.

```ts
function create(params: SignUpFutureCreateParams): Promise<{ error: ClerkError | null }>
```

This is useful when you want to allow users to go back to the beginning of the sign-up flow (e.g., to change their identifier during verification).
