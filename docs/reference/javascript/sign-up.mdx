title: '`SignUp`'
description: The SignUp object holds the state of the current sign-up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-up flow. Once a sign-up is complete, a new user is created.
sdk: js-frontend
---

The `SignUp` object holds the state of the current sign-up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-up process. Once a sign-up is complete, a new user is created.

The following steps outline the sign-up process:

1. Initiate the sign-up process by collecting the user's authentication information and passing the appropriate parameters to the [`create()`](#create) method.
1. Prepare the verification.
1. Attempt to complete the verification.
1. If the verification is successful, set the newly created session as the active session by passing the `SignIn.createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object.

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `id`
  - `string | undefined`

  The unique identifier of the current sign-up.

  ---

  - `status`
  - `'missing_requirements' | 'complete' | 'abandoned' | null`

  The status of the current sign-up. The following values are supported:

  - `complete:` The user has been created and the [custom flow](!custom-flow) can proceed to `setActive()` to create session.
  - `missing_requirements:` A requirement is unverified or missing from the [**User & authentication**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/user-and-authentication) settings. For example, in the Clerk Dashboard, the **Password** setting is required but a password wasn't provided in the custom flow.
  - `abandoned:` The sign-up has been inactive for over 24 hours.

  ---

### `create()`

Returns a new `SignUp` object based on the `params` you pass to it, stores the sign-up lifecycle state in the `status` property, and deactivates any existing sign-up process the client may already have in progress. Use this method to initiate a new sign-up process.

What you must pass to `params` depends on which [sign-up options](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options) you have enabled in your Clerk application instance.

Optionally, you can complete the sign-up process in one step if you supply the required fields to `create()`. Otherwise, Clerk's sign-up process provides great flexibility and allows users to easily create multi-step sign-up flows.

> [!WARNING]
> Once the sign-up process is complete, pass the `createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object. This will set the newly created session as the active session.

```typescript
function create(params: SignUpCreateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>

### `prepareEmailAddressVerification()`

Initiates an email verification process by sending a one-time verification code to the email address associated with the current sign-up attempt. This is a convenience method that wraps [`SignUp.prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification) with the `'email_code'` strategy.

By default, this method is equivalent to calling `SignUp.prepareVerification({ strategy: 'email_code' })`. It can be customized via the `PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams` to use alternative verification strategies like email links.

```typescript
function prepareEmailAddressVerification(
  params?: PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams,
): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### `PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams`

<Properties>

  The verification strategy to validate the user's sign-up request. The following strategies are supported:

  - `'phone_code'`: User will receive a one-time authentication code via SMS.
  - `'email_code'`: Send an email with a unique token to input.
  - `'email_link'`: Send an email with a link which validates sign-up.
  - `'oauth_<provider>'`: The user will be authenticated with their [social connection account](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/all-providers). See a list of [supported values for `<provider>`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sso).
  - `'saml'` (deprecated): **Deprecated in favor of `'enterprise_sso'`.** The user will be authenticated with their [SAML account](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/overview#saml).
  - `'enterprise_sso'`: The user will be authenticated either through SAML or OIDC depending on the configuration of their [enterprise SSO account](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/overview).
  - `'web3_base_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [Base](https://docs.base.org/base-account/guides/authenticate-users). The `web3_wallet_id` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known Web3 wallets will be used.
  - `'web3_metamask_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). The `web3_wallet_id` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known Web3 wallets will be used.
  - `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet). The `web3_wallet_id` parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known Web3 wallets will be used.

  - `redirectUrl`
  - `string`

  If `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`, this specifies the full URL or path that the OAuth provider should redirect to after successful authorization. Typically, this will be a simple `/sso-callback` route that either calls [`Clerk.handleRedirectCallback()`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#handle-redirect-callback) or mounts the [`<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />`](/docs/reference/components/control/authenticate-with-redirect-callback) component. See the [custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/oauth-connections) for implementation details.

  If `strategy` is set to `'email_link'`, this specifies The full URL that the user will be redirected to when they visit the email link. See the [custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-links) for implementation details.

  - `actionCompleteRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The full URL or path that the user will be redirected to after successful authorization from the OAuth provider and Clerk sign-in.

  ---

  - `oidcPrompt?`
  - `string`

  **Optional** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The value to pass to the [OIDC `prompt` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=prompt,reauthentication%20and%20consent) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.

  ---

  - `oidcLoginHint?`
  - `string`

  **Optional** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The value to pass to the [OIDC `login_hint` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=login_hint,in%20\(if%20necessary\).) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.

### `prepareWeb3WalletVerification()`

Initiates a verification process for a Web3 wallet by sending the wallet address to the server and retrieving a nonce that must be cryptographically signed by the wallet. This is a convenience method that wraps [`SignUp.prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification) with Web3 wallet strategies.

By default, this method is equivalent to calling `SignUp.prepareVerification({ strategy: 'web3_metamask_signature' })`. The verification process will fail if the wallet address is invalid or has already been verified. The returned nonce has a limited validity period and can only be used once.

```typescript
function prepareWeb3WalletVerification(
  params?: PrepareWeb3WalletVerificationParams,
): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### `PrepareWeb3WalletVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'web3_base_signature'` | `'web3_metamask_signature'` | `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'` | `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`

  The verification strategy to validate the user's sign-up request. The following strategies are supported:

  - `'web3_base_signature'`: User will need to sign a message and generate a signature using Base popup.
  - `'web3_metamask_signature'`: User will need to sign a message and generate a signature using MetaMask browser extension.
  - `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'`: User will need to sign a message and generate a signature using Coinbase Wallet.
  - `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`: User will need to sign a message and generate a signature using OKX Wallet.
</Properties>

### `update()`

Updates the current `SignUp`.

```typescript
function update(params: SignUpUpdateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### `SignUpUpdateParams`

`SignUpUpdateParams` is a mirror of [`SignUpCreateParams`](#sign-up-create-params) with the same fields and types, depending on the configuration of the instance.
