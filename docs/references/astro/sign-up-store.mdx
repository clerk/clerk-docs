# `$signUpStore`

The `$signUpStore` store gives you access to the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-up. This is also useful for creating a custom sign-up flow.

## How to use the `$signUpStore` store

### Check the current state of a sign-up with `$signUpStore`

Use the `$signUpStore` store to access the `SignUp` object and check the current state of a sign-up.

  ```tsx filename="sign-up-step.tsx"
  import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react';
  import { $signUpStore } from '@clerk/astro/client';

  export default function SignUpStep() {
    const signUp = $signUpStore;

    if (signUp === undefined) {
      // Add logic to handle loading state
      return null;
    }

    return <div>The current sign-up attempt status is {signUp.status}.</div>;
  }
  ```

The `status` property of the `SignUp` object can be one of the following values:

| Values | Descriptiom |
| --- | --- |
| `complete` | The user has been created and custom flow can proceed to [`setActive()`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods) to create session. |
| `abandoned` | The sign-up attempt will be abandoned if it was started more than 24 hours previously. |
| `missing_requirements` | A requirement from the [Email, Phone, Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) settings is missing. For example, in the Clerk Dashboard, the Password setting is required but a password was not provided in the custom flow. |

### Create a custom sign-up flow with `$signUpStore`

The `$signUpStore` store can also be used to build fully custom sign-up flows, if Clerk's pre-built components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow. Different sign-up flows include email and password, email and phone codes, email links, and multifactor (MFA).
