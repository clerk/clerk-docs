# `getSessionList()`

Retrieves a list of sessions.

```tsx
function getSessionList: (queryParams: QueryParams) => Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<Session[]>>;
```

## `QueryParams`

`getSessionList()` requires either `clientId` or `userId` to be provided.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clientId?` | `string` | The client ID to retrieve the list of sessions for. |
| `userId?` | `string` | The user ID to retrieve the list of sessions for. |
| `status?` | [`SessionStatus`](#session-status) | The status of the session. |
| `limit?` | `number` | The number of results to return. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than 501. |
| `offset?` | `number` | The number of results to skip. |

### `SessionStatus`

```tsx
type SessionStatus = "abandoned" | "active" | "ended" | "expired" | "removed" | "replaced" | "revoked";
```

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `abandoned`	| The session was abandoned client-side. |
| `active` | The session is valid and all activity is allowed. |
| `ended`	| The user signed out of the session, but the `Session` remains in the `Client` object. |
| `expired` | The period of allowed activity for this session has passed. |
| `removed` | The user signed out of the session and the `Session` was removed from the `Client` object. |
| `replaced` | The session has been replaced by another one, but the `Session` remains in the `Client` object. |
| `revoked` | The application ended the session and the `Session` was removed from the `Client` object. |

## `getSessionList()` examples

### `getSessionList({ userId })`

Retrieve a list of sessions for a specific `userId`:

```tsx
const userId = 'user_2V7JJKmoA9HqzHhfMqK5cpgLl56';

const response = await clerkClient.sessions.getSessionList({ userId });
```

### `getSessionList({ userId, status })`

In this example, a list of sessions with a `status` of `'expired'` is retrieved. You can see that the returned [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) includes `data`, which is an array of [`Session`](/docs/references/javascript/session) objects, and `totalCount`, which indicates the total number of sessions for the specified user.

```tsx {3, 15}
const userId = 'user_2V7JJKmoA9HqzHhfMqK5cpgLl56';

const status = 'expired'

const response = await clerkClient.sessions.getSessionList({ userId, status });

console.log(response);
/*
{
  data: [
    _Session {
      id: 'sess_2agTqj42O0jJYtiToTJJ2zybWOQ',
      clientId: 'client_2ZUtYQ0PhlbbMC6WSo7zwMCPihy',
      userId: 'user_2V7JJKmoA9HqzHhfMqK5cpgLl56',
      status: 'expired',
      lastActiveAt: 1705100946532,
      expireAt: 1705344214310,
      abandonAt: 1707331414310,
      createdAt: 1704739414310,
      updatedAt: 1705101240159
    }
  ],
  totalCount: 1
}
*/
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/sessions`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Sessions) for more details.
