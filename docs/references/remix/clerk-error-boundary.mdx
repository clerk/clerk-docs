Clerk uses short-lived tokens to keep your application secure. To refresh expired tokens Clerk [uses Remix's error boundary feature](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/error-boundary).

> If you do not implement this into your app, you will see a 401 after a short period of time even though your user is signed in.

## Usage

```tsx {13, 23-24}
import type { MetaFunction, LoaderFunction } from "@remix-run/node";

import {
  Links,
  LiveReload,
  Meta,
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
} from "@remix-run/react";

import { rootAuthLoader } from "@clerk/remix/ssr.server";
import { ClerkApp, ClerkErrorBoundary } from "@clerk/remix";

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => ({
  charset: "utf-8",
  title: "New Remix App",
  viewport: "width=device-width,initial-scale=1",
});

export const loader: LoaderFunction = (args) => rootAuthLoader(args);

// add an error boundary
export const ErrorBoundary = ClerkErrorBoundary();

function App() {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        <Outlet />
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
        <LiveReload />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

export default ClerkApp(App);
