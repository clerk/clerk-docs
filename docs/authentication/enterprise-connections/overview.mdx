title: Enterprise SSO
description: Clerk provides Enterprise SSO to authenticate users via federated Identity Providers such such as Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace and more.
---

With Enterprise SSO, users can sign in seamlessly using their Identity Provider's (IdP) credentials and have their user data synchronized with Clerk. You can learn more about the process in the guides on [authentication flows](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/authentication-flows) and [account linking](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/account-linking).

## SAML

Clerk supports Enterprise SSO via the SAML protocol, enabling you to create authentication strategies for an IdP. The following IdPs are supported: [Microsoft Azure AD](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/saml/azure), [Google Workspace](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/saml/google), and [Okta Workforce](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/saml/okta). However, you can also [integrate with any other IdP](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/saml/custom-provider) that supports the SAML protocol.

### Allow subdomains

Authenticating via SAML SSO requires the user's email address domain to match the exact domain the SAML connection has been configured with. By default, subdomains are not supported. For example, a user with the email address `john@sales.example.com` would not be able to use a SAML connection with the `example.com` domain in order to authenticate.

To configure subdomains for a SAML connection:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select the SAML connection you want to allow subdomains for.
1. Select the **Advanced** tab.
1. Enable or disable the **Allow subdomains** option.
1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable the **Allow subdomains** option, your SAML connection domain must be an [eTLD+1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/eTLD).

## EASIE

[EASIE](https://easie.dev) SSO is a way for applications to provide enterprise-grade SSO through a multi-tenant OpenID provider. It is designed to be an easier alternative to SAML SSO.

The following IdPs are supported: Google Workspace and Microsoft Entra ID. For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed. For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials. Follow the steps outlined in the guides to complete the setup:

- [Google](docs/authentication/social-connections/google)
- [Microsoft](docs/authentication/social-connections/azure)

### Automatic Deprovisioning

Clerk prevents users linked to deprovisioned accounts in the OpenID provider from accessing the application.

Within 10 minutes of a user being removed from the OpenID provider (e.g. [suspendeded](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33312?hl=en) or [deleted](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33314?hl=en) via Google Workspace, or [deleted](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/how-to-create-delete-users#delete-a-user) via Microsoft Entra), Clerk will recognize that the user has been deprovisioned and will revoke that user's existing sessions.

It is ultimately the application's responsibility to handle this unauthenticated state and display something appropriate to the user. For example, NextJS applications using [`auth.Protect`](docs/references/nextjs/auth#auth-protect) will automatically redirect the user to the sign-in page.

## SAML vs. EASIE

The primary security difference between EASIE SSO and SAML SSO is that EASIE depends on a multi-tenant identity provider, while SAML depends on a single-tenant identity provider. Relying on a multi-tenant provider **increases** the risk that a user from one tenant will mistakenly be granted access to the resources of another tenant. While Clerk implements [measures to address this risk](https://easie.dev/#mitigating-tenant-crossover-vulnerabilities), apps that require single-tenant IdPs should opt for SAML.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### I've enabled other strategies but they don't work

A Clerk application can have multiple authentication strategies, but a domain that enables Enterprise SSO can not. Once Enterprise SSO is enabled for a domain, there can be no other authentication methods for that specific domain. This is in line with an organization's intent to manage their users' identity from one place. This will allow your Clerk application to enable Enterprise SSO connections for certain domains while others use non-Enterprise SSO methods depending on each organization's needs.

### Will Enterprise SSO work for my existing users?

Yes, Enterprise SSO will work for your existing users as well! If you enable SAML or EASIE, any existing users with an email address that matches the SAML or EASIE Connection domain will have to authenticate on the IdP side and an Enterprise Account will be linked to their existing account.

### What happens if I have multi-factor enabled at Clerk?

This will work: Once the user comes back from the IdP, they will need to go through the extra factors of authentication. This is in case you need to add extra factors on top of what your IdP supports (or in case they don't). You can choose to not enable this feature if you wish.

### What happens if I delete the Enterprise Connection? Will my users be deleted?

The users will not be deleted, so your application will not break. However, they will need to use another [strategy](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#authentication-strategies) such as password, email OTP, etc., to authenticate themselves moving forward.

### Does Clerk support IdP-initiated SSO?

Yes, for SAML only. Clerk supports both Service Provider-initiated (SP-initiated) and Identity Provider-initiated (IdP-initiated) SSO flows. [Learn more](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/authentication-flows).

### How much does it cost?

For development instances, Enterprise Connections will always be free, but capped to 5.

Production instances require the Pro plan and the Enhanced Authentication Add-on. Please see [pricing](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.

### Can I get a bulk discount?

Yes, [contact support](/contact/support){{ target: '_blank' }} to work out a custom plan.
