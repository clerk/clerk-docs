  - Use Clerk to authenticate access to your Firebase data.
  - Configure your Firebase Clerk integration.
</TutorialHero>

Integrating Firebase with Clerk gives you the benefits of using Firebase's features while leveraging Clerk's authentication, prebuilt components, and webhooks.

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [demo repo](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-firebase-nextjs) for a full example of how to integrate Firebase with Clerk in a Next.js app.

<Steps>
  ### Configure the integration

  The Firebase integration enables you to use Clerk to generate a valid authentication token to send to Firebase Auth. This enables you to leverage Clerk's prebuilt components, auth provider options, and more, while accessing Firebase products like Firestore with a session validated by Firebase Auth.

  To get enable the integration:

  1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. In the sidebar, select **[Integrations](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=integrations)**.
  1. Toggle the **Firebase** integration on. The configuration modal will appear. Keep this open while you configure your Firebase project.

  Next, configure your integration.

  <Tabs type="configuration" items={["Configure automatically (Recommended)", "Configure manually"]}>
    <Tab>
      The recommended way to configure your integration is to use a service account key provided by Firebase in order to configure the integration _automatically_. To do so:

      1. In your Firebase project, visit [the Service Accounts settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk).
      1. Near the bottom of the page, select the **Generate new private key** button.
      1. In the modal that pops up, select the **Generate key** button to download the JSON file that contains your service account key.
      1. In the Clerk Dashboard, the Firebase configuration modal should still be open. Select the **Upload service account key** button and upload the JSON file you downloaded.
      1. The appropriate fields in the configuration modal will be filled in automatically. Select **Apply changes** to save your configuration.

      Select the **Configure manually** tab above these instructions if you do not want to use a service account key.
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      If you want to manually configure your Firebase integration, you must provide Clerk with the following information about your Firebase project:

      - **Service account email** – Find this in your Firebase project's [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?consoleUI=FIREBASE\&hl=fi\&supportedpurview=project), or in the `client_email` field of your service account key JSON file.
      - **Firestore project ID** – Find this under **Project Settings** in the Firebase dashboard, or in the `project_id` field of your service account key JSON file.
      - **Private Key** – You can [generate this manually](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#:~:text=In%20the%20Firebase%20console%2C%20open,confirm%20by%20clicking%20Generate%20Key.), or find it in the `private_key` field of your service account key JSON file.
      - **Firebase database URL** _(Optional)_ – To find this:
        - In the Firebase dashboard, select **Realtime Database**
        - Select the **Data** tab, and select the copy button to add the database URL to your clipboard.
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ### Enable authentication in Firebase

  To use Firebase auth, ensure authentication is enabled in your Firebase dashboard. To do so:

  1. Navigate to your Firebase dashboard.
  1. In the navigation sidebar, select the **Build** dropdown and select [**Authentication**](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/authentication).
  1. Select **Get started**.
  1. Enable any sign-in method you want, such as **Email/Password**.

  ### Add a Security Rule to your Firestore database (optional)

  Adding the [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) feature in your Firebase application is optional.

  To use Firestore with Clerk, ensure that you have defined [Security Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started) that allow authenticated requests to access your database. For example:

  ```bash {{ prettier: false }}
  service cloud.firestore {
    match /databases/{database}/documents {
      match /{document=**} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Get your Firebase config object

  To connect to your Firebase app in your code, you need a config object from your Firebase project. To find it:

  1. Visit [your Firebase project settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/).
  1. In the **Your apps** section, there should be a code snippet that includes the `firebaseConfig` object. Copy this object. It should look similar to the following:
     ```ts {{ prettier: false }}
     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
       authDomain: "clerk-example-xxxxx.firebaseapp.com",
       databaseURL: "https://clerk-example-xxxxx-default-xxxx.firebaseio.com",
       projectId: "clerk-test-xxxx",
       storageBucket: "clerk-test-xxxx.appspot.com",
       messagingSenderId: "012345678910",
       appId: "1:012345678:web:abcdef123456hijklm",
       measurementId: "G-ABC123DEF"
     };
     ```
  1. Save this information somewhere secure. You'll need it to connect to your Firebase app.

  See [Google's Firebase documentation](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592) for more information on the config object.

  ### Use Firebase with Clerk in your code

  Now that you have configured the integration, and you have retrieved your Firebase config object, it's time to use Firebase with Clerk in your code.

  The following example:

  - Expects the user to be signed into the app with Clerk.
  - Creates a button for signing into your Firebase app, which uses Clerk to generate an authentication token for Firebase's API.
  - Creates a button for fetching example data from your Firestore database.

  This example is written for Next.js App Router, but is supported by any React meta framework, such as Remix or Gatsby.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/firebase/page.tsx' }}
  'use client'
  import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'
  import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app'
  import { getAuth, signInWithCustomToken } from 'firebase/auth'
  import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore'
  import { doc, getDoc } from 'firebase/firestore'

  // Add your Firebase config object
  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
    authDomain: 'clerk-example-xxxxx.firebaseapp.com',
    databaseURL: 'https://clerk-example-xxxxx-default-xxxx.firebaseio.com',
    projectId: 'clerk-test-xxxx',
    storageBucket: 'clerk-test-xxxx.appspot.com',
    messagingSenderId: '012345678910',
    appId: '1:012345678:web:abcdef123456hijklm',
    measurementId: 'G-ABC123DEF',
  }

  // Connect to your Firebase app
  const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig)
  // Connect to your Firestore database
  const db = getFirestore(app)
  // Connect to Firebase auth
  const auth = getAuth(app)

  // Remove this if you do not have Firestore set up
  // for your Firebase app
  const getFirestoreData = async () => {
    const docRef = doc(db, 'example', 'example-document')
    const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef)
    if (docSnap.exists()) {
      console.log('Document data:', docSnap.data())
    } else {
      // docSnap.data() will be undefined in this case
      console.log('No such document!')
    }
  }

  export default function FirebaseUI() {
    const { getToken, userId } = useAuth()

    // Handle if the user is not signed in
    // You could display content, or redirect them to a sign-in page
    if (!userId) {
      return <p>You need to sign in with Clerk to access this page.</p>
    }

    const signIntoFirebaseWithClerk = async () => {
      const token = await getToken({ template: 'integration_firebase' })

      const userCredentials = await signInWithCustomToken(auth, token || '')
      // The userCredentials.user object can call the methods of
      // the Firebase platform as an authenticated user.
      console.log('User:', userCredentials.user)
    }

    return (
      <main style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', rowGap: '1rem' }}>
        <button onClick={signIntoFirebaseWithClerk}>Sign in</button>

        {/* Remove this button if you do not have Firestore set up */}
        <button onClick={getFirestoreData}>Get document</button>
      </main>
    )
  }
  ```
