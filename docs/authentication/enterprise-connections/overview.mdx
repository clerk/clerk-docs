title: Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO)
description: Clerk provides Enterprise SSO to authenticate users via federated Identity Providers such such as Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace and more.
---

Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to sign in seamlessly using their Identity Provider (IdP) credentials (e.g.,Azure AD, Okta, or Google Workspace) and have their user data synchronized with Clerk. Clerk supports multiple protocols for implementing Enterprise SSO, including SAML and OIDC. Learn more about the process in the guides on [authentication flows](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/authentication-flows) and [account linking](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/account-linking).

## SAML

Clerk supports Enterprise SSO via the SAML protocol, enabling you to create authentication strategies for an IdP. The following IdPs are supported: [Microsoft Azure AD](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/saml/azure), [Google Workspace](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/saml/google), and [Okta Workforce](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/saml/okta). However, you can also [integrate with any other IdP](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/saml/custom-provider) that supports the SAML protocol.

#### Allow subdomains

Authenticating via SAML SSO requires the user's email address domain to match the exact domain the SAML connection has been configured with. By default, subdomains are not supported. For example, a user with the email address `john@sales.example.com` wouldn't be able to use a SAML connection with the `example.com` domain to authenticate.

To configure subdomains for a SAML connection:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select the SAML connection you want to allow subdomains for.
1. Select the **Advanced** tab.
1. Enable or disable the **Allow subdomains** option.
1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable the **Allow subdomains** option, your SAML connection domain must be an [eTLD+1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/eTLD).

## OIDC

Clerk supports Enterprise SSO via the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol, either through [EASIE](#easie) or by [integrating with any OIDC-compatible provider](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/oidc/custom-provider).

### EASIE

[EASIE](https://easie.dev) SSO is a way for applications to provide enterprise-grade SSO through a multi-tenant OpenID provider. It is designed to be an easier alternative to SAML SSO.

The following IdPs are supported: Google Workspace and Microsoft Entra ID. For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed. For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials. Follow the steps outlined in the guides to complete the setup:

- [Google](/docs/authentication/social-connections/google)
- [Microsoft](/docs/authentication/social-connections/microsoft)

#### Automatic deprovisioning

Clerk prevents users linked to deprovisioned accounts in the OpenID provider from accessing the app.

Within 10 minutes of a user being removed from the OpenID provider (e.g. [suspendeded](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33312?hl=en) or [deleted](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33314?hl=en) via Google Workspace, or [deleted](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/how-to-create-delete-users#delete-a-user) via Microsoft Entra), Clerk will recognize that the user has been deprovisioned and will revoke that user's existing sessions.

It is ultimately the app's responsibility to handle this unauthenticated state and display something appropriate to the user. For example, Next.js apps using [`auth.protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#auth-protect) will automatically redirect the user to the sign-in page.

### SAML vs. EASIE

The primary security difference between EASIE SSO and SAML SSO is that EASIE depends on a multi-tenant identity provider, while SAML depends on a single-tenant identity provider. Relying on a multi-tenant provider **increases** the risk that a user from one tenant will mistakenly be granted access to the resources of another tenant. While Clerk implements [measures to address this risk](https://easie.dev/#mitigating-tenant-crossover-vulnerabilities), apps that require single-tenant IdPs should opt for SAML.

For more information, see the [EASIE docs](https://easie.dev#security).

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### I've enabled other strategies but they don't work

A Clerk app can have multiple authentication strategies, but a domain that enables Enterprise SSO can't. Once Enterprise SSO is enabled for a domain, there can be no other authentication methods for that specific domain. This is in line with an organization's intent to manage their users' identity from one place. This allows your Clerk app to enable Enterprise SSO connections for certain domains while others use non-Enterprise SSO methods depending on each organization's needs.

### Will Enterprise SSO work for my existing users?

Yes, Enterprise SSO will work for your existing users as well! If you enable SAML or EASIE, any existing users with an email address that matches the SAML or EASIE connection domain will have to authenticate on the IdP side and an Enterprise account will be linked to their existing account.

### What happens if I have multi-factor enabled at Clerk?

Once the user returns from the IdP, they will need to complete additional authentication factors. This is useful if you want to add extra factors beyond what your IdP supports or if your IdP doesn’t support them. This feature is optional and can be disabled if not needed.

### What happens if I delete the Enterprise Connection? Will my users be deleted?

The users will not be deleted, so your app will not break. However, they will need to use another [strategy](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#authentication-strategies) such as password or email to authenticate themselves moving forward.

### Does Clerk support IdP-initiated SSO?

Yes, for SAML only. Clerk supports both Service Provider-initiated (SP-initiated) and Identity Provider-initiated (IdP-initiated) SSO flows. For more information, see the [authentication flows guide](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/authentication-flows).

### How much does it cost?

For development instances, Enterprise connections are always free but limited to a maximum of 25.

Production instances require the Pro plan and the Enhanced Authentication Add-on. Please see [pricing](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.

### Can I get a bulk discount?

Yes, [contact support](/contact/support){{ target: '_blank' }} to work out a custom plan.
