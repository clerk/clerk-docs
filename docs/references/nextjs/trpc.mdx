# Integrate Clerk into your Next.js Pages Router app with tRPC

Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Next.js Pages Router application using [tRPC](https://trpc.io/). tRPC can be used with Clerk, but requires a few tweaks from a traditional Clerk + Next.js setup.

## Installation

<Steps>

### Install `@clerk/nextjs`

Clerk's Next.js SDK gives you access to prebuilt components and hooks, as well as our [helpers](/docs/references/nextjs/overview) for Next.js API routes, server-side rendering, and middleware.

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/nextjs
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add @clerk/nextjs
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @clerk/nextjs
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment keys

Below is an example of an `.env.local` file. If you are signed into your Clerk Dashboard, your keys should become visible by clicking on the eye icon.

<InjectKeys>

```sh filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
```

</InjectKeys>

### Configure middleware

[Middleware](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware) allows you to use Clerk server-side APIs. Create a `middleware.ts` file. If your application uses the `src/` directory, your `middleware.ts` file should be placed inside the `src/` folder. If you are not using a `src/` directory, place the `middleware.ts` file in your root directory.

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default authMiddleware();

export const config = {
      matcher: ['/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],
};
```

<Callout>
  This will protect every page by default, including API routes, and cause a redirect to Clerk's [Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview). Read more about Clerk's middleware [here](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware).
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Using Clerk in your tRPC Context

To use Clerk in your tRPC context, you will need to use our server helper [`getAuth`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth).

```ts
import * as trpc from '@trpc/server';
import * as trpcNext from '@trpc/server/adapters/next';
import { getAuth, SignedInAuthObject, SignedOutAuthObject } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

interface AuthContext {
  auth: SignedInAuthObject | SignedOutAuthObject;
}

export const createContextInner = async ({ auth }: AuthContext  ) => {
  return {
    auth,
  }
}

export const createContext = async (
  opts: trpcNext.CreateNextContextOptions
) => {
  return await createContextInner({ auth: getAuth(opts.req) })
}

export type Context = trpc.inferAsyncReturnType<typeof createContext>;
```

## Accessing the context data in your application

Once you have context in your application, you can access the data in any procedure by using `ctx` in your queries.

```ts
import { router, publicProcedure } from '../trpc';

export const exampleRouter = router({
  hello: publicProcedure.query(({ctx}) => {
      return {
        greeting: `hello! ${ctx.auth?.userId}`
      }
    })
})
```

## Using tRPC Middleware

In most cases, you need to protect your routes from users who aren't signed in. You can create a protected procedure.

```ts
import { initTRPC, TRPCError } from '@trpc/server'
import superjson from 'superjson'
import { type Context } from './context'

const t = initTRPC.context<Context>().create({
  transformer: superjson,
  errorFormatter({ shape }) {
    return shape
  }
})

// check if the user is signed in, otherwise throw a UNAUTHORIZED CODE
const isAuthed = t.middleware(({ next, ctx }) => {
  if (!ctx.auth.userId) {
    throw new TRPCError({ code: 'UNAUTHORIZED' })
  }
  return next({
    ctx: {
      auth: ctx.auth,
    },
  })
})

export const router = t.router

export const publicProcedure = t.procedure

// export this procedure to be used anywhere in your application
export const protectedProcedure = t.procedure.use(isAuthed)
```

Once you have created your procedure, you can use it in any router. The example below uses the protected procedure and returns the user's name.

```ts
import { router, protectedProcedure } from '../trpc'

export const protectedRouter = router({
  hello: protectedProcedure.query(({ ctx }) => {
    return {
      secret: `${ctx.auth?.userId} is using a protected procedure`
    }
  })
})
```
