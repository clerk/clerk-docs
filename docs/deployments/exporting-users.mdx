# Export your user's data from Clerk

## Access user data in the backend

By using the [GetUserList](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/GetUserList) endpoint of Clerk's Backend API, you can programmatically export your user's data safely.

Additionally, the [`getUserList()`](/docs/references/backend/user/get-user-list) method in the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) can also be used to retrieve a list of users.

## Migrating your users to a new system

While we don't expose this via our Backend APIs, if you wish to get your user's data that _includes their hashed passwords_, please [Contact Support](https://clerk.com/contact/support) where we can export a `.csv` file and assist you in a secure data exchange.
