How to setup social connection with Box

## Overview

Adding social connection with Box to your app with Clerk is simple - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your Box account.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Box developer account and a Box OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/social-connections-oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/get-started/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Box developer account. To create one, [click here](https://developer.box.com/).

## Configuring Box social connection

First, you need to create a new OAuth2 Box app. You can find this option in your Console > Create new app. Choose Custom App and then select User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)

You need to choose an app name and then click **Create application**.
