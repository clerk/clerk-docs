description: Learn how to use the Clerk Dashboard to manage your application settings, users, and more.
---

The Clerk Dashboard is where you create your Clerk application and is the central hub for managing your instance's settings, users, Organizations, and more.

At the top of the Clerk Dashboard, you will see a few notable features:

- The workspace dropdown: Allows you to switch between [workspaces](#workspaces) or create a new one.
- The application dropdown: Allows you to choose which application you want to manage or create a new one.
- The instance dropdown: Allows you to switch between your [development and production instances](#instances).
- The [`<UserButton />`](/docs/reference/components/user/user-button): Allows you to manage your account and sign out.

We try to make the Clerk Dashboard as intuitive as possible, but if you ever need help or have any feedback, you can always reach out to our [support team](https://clerk.com/support).

## Workspaces

Workspaces are a way to group applications and resources together.

When you create a Clerk account in the Clerk Dashboard, you are automatically added to a workspace called your **Personal workspace**. You can edit the name of this workspace, along with other settings, on the Clerk Dashboard's [**Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/settings) page.

When you visit the Clerk Dashboard, a workspace is always selected/active. The last workspace used will be selected by default. You can switch between workspaces or create a new one by selecting the workspace dropdown in the top-left of the Clerk Dashboard.

Each workspace can have a **team** with multiple members. You can invite team members to a workspace by visiting the [**Team**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/team) page and then selecting **Invite user**. Each team member can have a different [role](#roles-in-a-workspace), which determines their access levels and permissions within the workspace.

### Roles in a workspace

Clerk distinguishes between different roles to help manage team members' access levels and permissions within a workspace. Each role within Clerk is assigned specific permissions that determine what actions a member can perform. When assigning roles to team members, consider the following:

- Which resources does this team member need access to?
- What actions should this team member be able to perform?
- What level of system configuration access is required?

**The available roles are:**

### Create additional workspaces

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select **Create workspace**. A modal will open.
1. Complete the form. Workspace slugs are unique across all instances, so common naming conventions might already be in use by another instance.
1. Select **Create workspace**. The newly created workspace will be set the active workspace.

### Invite team members to your workspace

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select **Manage**. You will be redirected to the Team settings page of the active workspace.
1. Select **Invite user**.
1. In the **Invite user** form, enter the email of the user you want to invite and select the [role](#roles-in-a-workspace) to assign.
1. Select **Invite**.

### Transfer ownership of an application

Transferring an application between two workspaces does not cause disruptions. Your API keys, settings, domains, and other configurations remain unchanged, and your app will continue to function as expected. Only the ownership is updated, so no further action is needed to maintain continuity for existing users.

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), open the workspace dropdown and select the workspace that contains the application you want to transfer.
1. Locate and select the application to transfer.
1. Navigate to the application's [**Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/settings) page.
1. In the **Danger zone** section, select **Transfer ownership**. A modal will open.
1. Complete the form and select **Transfer ownership**. The page will redirect to the **Applications** page and show the transferred application.

#### Transfer to a workspace without billing information

**An application with an existing paid subscription can only be transferred to a workspace with active billing information**. You can set up billing information on the receiving workspace without being charged.

To set up a payment method without being charged:

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select the workspace that you want to transfer the application to.
1. Select the workspace dropdown again, and select **Manage**.
1. In the top menu bar, select **Billing**, then select **Upgrade to unlimited members**.
1. Add your billing information. **You will not be charged immediately**. Doing this just ensures billing information is added to the workspace.
1. Once that billing information is added, you will be able to transfer your Clerk app to the receiving workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a temporary solution for this issue. Clerk is actively working to improve this process.

## Instances

Each Clerk application can have two different instances: `Development` or `Production`. The names are self-explanatory, but you can learn more about the differences between the two in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/development/managing-environments).

When you create a new application, it is automatically provisioned with a `Development` instance. You can switch between instances or provision your `Production` instance by selecting the instance dropdown in the top-left of the Clerk Dashboard.
