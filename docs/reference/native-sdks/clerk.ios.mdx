`Clerk` is the main entry point for the SDK. You can access it in two ways:

## SwiftUI

After you inject `Clerk.shared` into the environment (see the example in [Configuration](/docs/reference/native-sdks/configuration#basic-configuration)), you can access it with `@Environment(Clerk.self)`.

```swift
import ClerkKit
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
  @Environment(Clerk.self) private var clerk

  var body: some View {
    if clerk.user != nil {
      Text("Signed in")
    } else {
      Text("Signed out")
    }
  }
}
```

## Access the shared instance

If you're not using SwiftUI, you can always access Clerk through the shared instance.

```swift
let clerk = Clerk.shared
```
