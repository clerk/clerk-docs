This tutorial outlines how to integrate Clerk's authentication with your Shopify Plus store, allowing you to use Clerk as your identity provider for customer logins. In Shopify, using [your own Identity Provider for customer login](https://changelog.shopify.com/posts/use-your-own-identity-provider-for-customer-login) is only available to stores on the **Shopify Plus plan**.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Shopify admin](https://admin.shopify.com).

<Steps>
  ## Create a new Clerk OAuth application

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**OAuth applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/oauth-applications) page.
  1. Select **Add OAuth application**. A modal will open.
  1. Enter the **Name** of your new OAuth application.
  1. For the **Scopes**, ensure to select `openid`. The following scopes should be enabled: `openid`, `email`, and `profile`.
  1. Select **Add**. You'll be presented with the **Client Secret**.
  1. Select **Copy secret** and save the value somewhere secure. You'll be redirected to the OAuth app's settings page.
  1. Under **Application Credentials**, copy and save the **Client ID** somewhere secure.
  1. Under **Application Configuration URLs**, copy and save the **Discovery URL** somewhere secure. Keep this page open.

  ## Connect a new Shopify provider

  1. In a new tab, navigate to your [Shopify admin](https://admin.shopify.com).
  1. In the left sidenav, select **Settings**. You'll be redirected to your shop's **General** settings page.
  1. In the left sidenav, select **Customer accounts**. You'll be redirected to the **Customer accounts** page.
  1. Next to **Identity provider**, select **Manage**. You'll be redirected to the **Identity provider** page.

  1. In the **Post-logout redirect URI parameter name** field, enter `returnTo`.
