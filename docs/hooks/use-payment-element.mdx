title: '`usePaymentElement()`'
description: Clerk's usePaymentElement() hook provides methods and state for interacting with a payment form.
sdk: nextjs, react
---

<Include src="_partials/billing/api-experimental" />

The `usePaymentElement()` hook is used to control the payment form rendered by the [`<PaymentElement />`](#payment-element) component. It provides the necessary state and methods to submit payment details to a payment provider like Stripe.

This hook must be used within a component that is a descendant of the `<PaymentElementProvider />` component. It is typically used in a checkout flow that prompts a user to add a new payment method, or for adding a new payment method outside of a checkout.

## Parameters

`usePaymentElement()` doesn't accept any parameters. It derives its state and configuration from the nearest [`<PaymentElementProvider />`](#payment-element-provider).

## Returns

`usePaymentElement()` returns an object with the following properties:

<Properties>
  - `submit()`
  - `() => Promise<{ data: { gateway: 'stripe'; paymentToken: string } | null; error: PaymentElementError | null}>`

  A function that submits the payment form data to the payment provider. It returns a promise that resolves with either a `data` object containing a payment token on success, or an `error` object on failure.

  ---

  - `reset()`
  - `() => Promise<void>`

  A function that resets the payment form to its initial, empty state.

  ---

  - `isFormReady`
  - `boolean`

  A boolean that indicates if the payment form UI has been rendered and is ready for user input. This is useful for disabling a submit button until the form is interactive.

  ---

  - `isProviderReady`
  - `boolean`

  A boolean that indicates if the underlying payment provider (e.g. Stripe) has been fully initialized.

  ---

  - `provider`
  - `{ name: 'stripe' } | undefined`

  An object containing information about the initialized payment provider. It is `undefined` until `isProviderReady` is `true`.
</Properties>

## Payment element components

The `usePaymentElement()` hook works in conjunction with the `<PaymentElementProvider />` and `<PaymentElement />` components.

### `<PaymentElementProvider />`

The `<PaymentElementProvider />` component sets up the context for the payment element. It fetches all the necessary data from the payment provider (e.g., Stripe) and makes it available to its children.

#### Properties

<Properties>
  - `checkout?`
  - [`CommerceCheckoutResource`](/docs/references/javascript/types/commerce-checkout-resource)

  An optional checkout resource object. When provided, the payment element is scoped to the specific checkout session.

  ---

  - `for?`
  - `'user' | 'organization'`

  Specifies whether the payment method is being added for a user or an organization. Defaults to `'user'`.

  ---

  - `stripeAppearance?`
  - `object`

  An optional object to customize the appearance of the Stripe Payment Element. This allows you to match the form's styling to your application's theme.

  ---

  - `paymentDescription?`
  - `string`

  An optional description to display to the user within the payment element UI.
</Properties>

### `<PaymentElement />`

This component renders the actual payment form from the provider (e.g., the Stripe Payment Element). It should be rendered as a child of `<PaymentElementProvider />`.

#### Properties

<Properties>
  - `fallback?`
  - `ReactNode`

  Optional fallback content, such as a loading skeleton, to display while the payment form is being initialized.
</Properties>
