# Integrate Convex with Clerk

In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [JWT Templates](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=jwt-templates)page. Select the **New template** button to create a new template based on Convex.

  alt="The JWT Templates page in the Clerk Dashboard. The 'New template' button was clicked, and a pop up titled 'New JWT template' is shown. The 'Convex' template is hovered over."

Once the Convex template is created, you will be redirected to the template's page. You can now configure the template to your needs.

/>

The Convex template will pre-populate the default audience (`aud`) claim required by Convex. You can include additional claims as necessary. [Shortcodes](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates#shortcodes) are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.

By default, Clerk will sign the JWT with a private key automatically generated for your application, which is what most developers use for Convex. If you so choose, you can customize this key.

## Configure Convex

The next step is to configure Convex with the issuer domain provided by Clerk. From your Clerk **JWT template** screen, find the **Issuer** input and click to **Copy** the URL.

  src="/docs/images/integrations/convex/template-issuer.webp"
  alt="The 'Create new template' page of the JWT Templates page in the Clerk Dashboard. There is a red box surrounding the 'Issuer' section."
/>

In your terminal, run the following command from your Convex app directory:

```sh filename="terminal"
npx convex auth add
```

Paste the **Issuer** URL you copied when it prompts you for the identity provider's URL.

The application/client ID will need to match the `aud` claim (default is `convex`).

```sh
? Enter the identity providers Domain URL: https://your-issuer-url.clerk.accounts.dev/
? Enter your application/client ID with this identity provider: convex
? Would you like to add another provider? No
? Configuration updated. Run npx convex dev or npx convex deploy to sync these changes.
```

## Configure the providers

Both Clerk and Convex have Provider components that are required to wrap your React application to provide the authentication and client context.

```jsx
import "../styles/globals.css";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { ClerkProvider, useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { ConvexProvider, ConvexReactClient } from "convex/react";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL);

function ClerkConvexAdapter() {
  const { getToken, isSignedIn } = useAuth();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isSignedIn) {
      convex.setAuth(async () =>
        getToken({ template: "convex", skipCache: true })
      );
    } else {
      convex.clearAuth();
    }
  }, [getToken, isSignedIn]);
  return null;
}

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider
      publishableKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
    >
      <ConvexProvider client={convex}>
        <ClerkConvexAdapter />
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </ConvexProvider>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
```

## Access user identity

In some cases, you may need to access the user when using Convex queries and mutations. You can use the `getUserIdentity()` method provided on the `auth` property, which is passed to the context argument of every Convex function invocation.

```ts filename="convex/getUser.ts"
import type { UserIdentity } from 'convex/server';
import { query } from './_generated/server';

export default query(async ({ auth }): Promise<UserIdentity | null> => {
  const identity = await auth.getUserIdentity();

  return identity;
});
```

The identity object should match the [openID spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims), you can update the JWT template to include them for example:

```sh
{
  "email": "{{user.primary_email_address}}",
  "picture": "{{user.profile_image_url}}",
  "given_name": "{{user.first_name}}",
  "family_name": "{{user.last_name}}",
  "email_verified": "{{user.email_verified}}"
}
```
