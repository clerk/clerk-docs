# `SignIn`

The `SignIn` object holds all the state of the current sign in and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign in process.

There are two important steps in the sign in flow.

1. Users *must* complete a first factor verification. This can be something like providing a password, an email magic link, a one-time code (OTP), a web3 wallet public address or providing proof of their identity through an external social account (SSO/OAuth).
2. After that, users *might need to* go through a second verification process. This is the second factor (2FA).

The `SignIn` object's properties can be split into logical groups, with each group providing information on different aspects of the sign in flow. These groups can be:

- Information about the current sign in status in general and which authentication identifiers, authentication methods and verifications are supported.
- Information about the user and the provided authentication identifier value (email address, phone number or username).Information about each verification, either the first factor (logging in) or the second factor (2FA).

## Methods

### `create()`

```typescript
function create(params: SignInCreateParams): Promise<SignIn>;
```

Use this method to kick-off the sign in flow. It creates a **SignIn** object and stores the sign in lifecycle state.

Depending on the use-case and the `params` you pass to the `create` method, it can either complete the sign in process in one go, or simply collect part of the necessary data for completing authentication at a later stage.

#### `SignInCreateParams`

  rows={[
    {cells: [<code>identifier</code>, <code>string</code>, <>The authentication identifier for the sign in. This can be the value of the user's email address, phone number or username.</>]},
{cells: [<code>strategy</code>, <code>string</code>,<>Optional. Select the first factor verification strategy. The <code>strategy</code> value depends on the object's <code>identifier</code> value. Each authentication identifier supports different verification strategies. Possible <code>strategy</code> values are:
<ul>
<li><strong><code>email_link</code></strong>: User will receive an email magic link via email. The <code>email_address_id</code> parameter can also be specified to select one of the user's known email addresses.</li>
<li><strong><code>email_code</code></strong>: User will receive a one-time authentication code via email. At least one email address should be on file for the user. The <code>email_address_id</code> parameter can also be specified to select one of the user's known email addresses.</li>
<li><strong><code>phone_code</code></strong>: User will receive a one-time authentication code in their phone, via SMS. At least one phone number should be on file for the user. The <code>phone_number_id</code> parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known phone numbers the SMS will go to.</li>
<li><strong><code>web3_metamask_signature</code></strong>: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's web3 wallet public address. The <code>web3_wallet_id</code> parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known web3 wallets will be used. Currently Clerk supports [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).</li>
<li><strong><code>{"oauth_<provider>"}</code></strong>: The user will be authenticated with their Social login account. See available OAuth Strategies.</li>
<li><strong><code>ticket</code></strong>: The user will be authenticated via a "ticket" or "token" generated from the Backend API.</li>
</ul></>]},
{cells: [<code>password</code>, <code>string</code>, <>Optional. Supply the user's password, if <strong><code>password</code></strong> strategy has been specified.</>]},
{cells: [<code>ticket</code>, <code>string</code>, <>Optional. If the strategy is <strong><code>ticket</code></strong> you need to provide the ticket <em>or token</em> generated from the Backend API.</>]},

### `resetPassword()`

```typescript
function resetPassword(params: ResetPasswordParams): Promise<SignIn>;
```

### `createMagicLinkFlow()`

```typescript
function createMagicLinkFlow(): {
  startMagicLinkFlow: (params: SignInStartMagicLinkFlowParams) => Promise<SignIn>,
  cancelMagicLinkFlow: () => void
}
```

Sets up a sign in with magic link flow. Calling `createMagicLinkFlow()` will return two functions. The first function is async and starts the magic link flow, preparing a magic link verification. It sends the magic link email and starts polling for verification results. The signature is `startMagicLinkFlow({ redirectUrl: string, emailAddressId: string }) => Promise<SignInResource>`.

The second function can be used to stop polling at any time, allowing for full control of the flow and cleanup. The signature is `cancelMagicLinkFlow() => void`.

#### Returns

`createMagicLinkFlow` returns an object with two functions:

It prepares a magic link verification and polls for the verification result.</>]},
