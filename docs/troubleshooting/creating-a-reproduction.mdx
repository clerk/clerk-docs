# Creating a Minimal Reproduction

## What is a Minimal Reproduction?

Software development is hard, and there are an infinite number of different ways that you can configure and code a given application. Additionally, with large and complex applications, the cause of an error can be traced back to a wide variety of different things, making issues even more difficult to debug. The creation of minimal reproductions is an essential tool in any seasoned developer’s belt for resolving difficult issues, as this process gradually eliminates causes of an issue, narrowing it down to only the root cause. Let’s walk through how exactly this powerful tool can be used to debug and resolve issues!

<Callout>
A minimal reproduction is a small test case to demonstrate a problem - often this problem is caused by a bug in the library or user code. Your minimal reproduction should contain the bare minimum code needed to clearly demonstrate that bug.

## Templates

The best way to create a minimal reproduction is to start fresh, with a minimal functional template. Clerk provides minimal functional templates for each of the frameworks we have SDKs for, which are great starting points:

- [Next.js App Router](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-nextjs-app-quickstart)
- [Next.js Pages Router](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-nextjs-pages-quickstart)
- [Remix](https://github.com/clerkinc/remix-auth-starter)
- [Chrome Extension](https://github.com/clerkinc/clerk-chrome-extension-starter)
- [Expo](https://github.com/clerkinc/clerk-expo-starter)
- [React](https://github.com/clerkinc/clerk-react-starter)
- [Rails](https://github.com/clerkinc/clerk-rails-starter)
- [Redwood](https://github.com/clerkinc/clerk-redwood-starter)
- [Vanilla JS](https://github.com/clerkinc/clerk-js-starter)
- [Gatsby](https://github.com/clerkinc/clerk-gatsby-starter)

## Steps to create a Minimal Reproduction

1. Clone down one of these templates to have it locally on on your machine.
3. Create a new Clerk app on the Clerk dashboard. Add the keys from this project to your minimal reproduction.
4. Run it locally (e.g. run the development server) and verify that it’s functional.
4. Adjust your template project and keep adding code gradually until you get to the point where you are running into the same error.

It’s important throughout this process to be vigilant about removing code that is not necessary to produce the issue. The ideal result is that the repository gets to state where the exact same issue is able to be produced, with the fewest lines of code possible to get to that point (beyond the baseline included in the starter templates).

Often times, the process of creating the minimal reproduction will clarify or resolve the original issue. This is great, if it does happen! The magic of minimal reproductions 

## Clerk’s Support Requirements

Our support team here at Clerk *requires minimal reproductions* in order to start looking into reported bugs or issues for any users or customers that are not on an enterprise plan. As much as we wish that we had the time to pair and help everyone debug their apps, it’s not financially sustainable for us as a company to do this. As soon as you submit a minimal reproduction, we will look into and attempt to resolve your issue as quickly as we are able to! Let’s cover what counts as an acceptable submission of a minimal reproduction:

### Dos

- A link to a github/bitbucket/gitlab/etc repository, based off one of the starter templates above, containing a minimal reproduction, including any steps that must be taken in the app to produce the error in a readme (click X button, log in using Y provider, etc)
- A zip file containing a repository that contains a minimal reproduction, including a readme with steps on how to produce the error

### Don'ts
- A list of steps that we can take to produce the error
- A pasted error message or error trace
- A link/zip of a full featured app or branch within an app were an error is occurring
- A link to a line in your, or our codebase where an error is presumed to be
- A document containing code blocks that, if combined, describe an app that produces a minimal reproduction
- A link to a repository with a minimal reproduction but no information on how to produce the issue
- A link to a repository with a minimal reproduction that contains a bunch of other third party libraries that are required to produce the issue
