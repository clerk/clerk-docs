# `authenticateRequest()`

Authenticates a token passed from the frontend. Networkless if the `jwtKey` is provided. Otherwise, performs a network call to retrieve the JWKS from [Clerk's Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/JWKS#operation/GetJWKS).

```tsx {{ prettier: false }}
function authenticateRequest: (request: Request, options: AuthenticateRequestOptions) => Promise<RequestState>;
```

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `request` | `Request` | `Request` object |
| `options?` | [`AuthenticateRequestOptions`](#authenticate-request-options) | Optional options to configure the authentication. |

## `AuthenticateRequestOptions`

It is recommended to set these options as [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#api-and-sdk-configuration) where possible, and then pass them to the function. For example, you can set the `secretKey` option using the `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variable, and then pass it to the function like this: `createClerkClient({ secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY })`.

> [!WARNING]
> You must provide either `jwtKey` or `secretKey`.

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `secretKey?` | `string` | The Clerk secret key from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard. |
| `publishableKey?` | `string` | The Clerk publishable key from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard. |
| `jwtKey?` | `string` | Used to verify the session token in a networkless manner. Supply the PEM public key from the **[API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page -> Show JWT public key -> PEM Public Key** section of the Clerk Dashboard. For more information, refer to [Manual JWT verification](/docs/backend-requests/handling/manual-jwt). |
| `domain?` | `string` | The domain for the application. For development, you can pass the localhost your application is running on. For example: `localhost:3001` |
| `isSatellite?` | `boolean` | Set to `true` if the instance is a satellite domain in a multi-domain setup. |
| `proxyUrl?` | `string` | The proxy URL from a multi-domain setup. |
| `signInUrl?` | `string` | The sign-in URL from a multi-domain setup. |
| `signUpUrl?` | `string` | It's recommended to use sign-up URL from a multi-domain setup. |
| `afterSignInUrl?` | `string` | Full URL or path to navigate to after successful sign in. Defaults to `/`. |
| `afterSignUpUrl?` | `string` | Full URL or path to navigate to after successful sign up. Defaults to `/`. |
| `audience?` | `string \| string[]` | A string or list of [audiences](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3). |
| `authorizedParties?` | `string[]` | An allowlist of origins to verify against, to protect your application from the subdomain cookie leaking attack.<br />For example: `['http://localhost:3000', 'https://example.com']` |
| `clockSkewInMs?` | `number` | Specifies the allowed time difference (in milliseconds) between the Clerk server (which generates the token) and the clock of the user's application server when validating a token. Defaults to 5000 ms (5 seconds). |
| `jwksCacheTtlInMs?` (deprecated) | `number` | Deprecated. Specifying a cache TTL is now a no-op. |
| `skipJwksCache?` | `boolean` | A flag to skip ignore cache and always fetch JWKS before each jwt verification. |

## Examples

### With a higher-level SDK

`authenticateRequest()` requires `publishableKey` to be set. If you are importing `clerkClient` from a higher-level SDK, such as Next.js, then `clerkClient` infers the `publishableKey` from your [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#clerk-publishable-and-secret-keys).

```tsx {{ prettier: false }}
import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const { isSignedIn } = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(req);

  if (!isSignedIn) {
    return Response.json({ status: 401 });
  }

  // Perform protected actions
  // Add logic to perform protected actions

  return Response.json({ message: 'This is a reply' });
}
```

### With the Backend SDK on its own

If you are using the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) on its own, you need to provide the `secretKey` and `publishableKey` to `createClerkClient()` so that it is passed to `authenticateRequest()`. You can set these values as [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#clerk-publishable-and-secret-keys) and then pass them to the function.

```tsx {{ prettier: false }}
import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend';

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const clerkClient = createClerkClient({
    secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY,
    publishableKey: process.env.CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
  });

  const { isSignedIn } = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(req);

  if (!isSignedIn) {
    return Response.json({ status: 401 });
  }

  // Add logic to perform protected actions

  return Response.json({ message: 'This is a reply' });
}
```

### Networkless token verification

{/* Note: this example is duped from /authenticate-request. Probably a good opportunity to use a partial here */}

The following example uses the `authenticateRequest()` method with the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) to verify the token passed by the frontend, and performs a networkless authentication by passing `jwtKey`. This will verify if the user is signed into the application or not.

```tsx {{ prettier: false }}
import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend';

export async function GET(req: Request) {
  const clerkClient = createClerkClient({
    secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY,
    publishableKey: process.env.CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
  });

  const { isSignedIn } = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(req, {
    jwtKey: process.env.CLERK_JWT_KEY,
  });

  if (!isSignedIn) {
    return Response.json({ status: 401 });
  }

  // Add logic to perform protected actions

  return Response.json({ message: 'This is a reply' });
}
```
