description: Learn about various ways to make authenticated requests to the backend when using Clerk SDKs.
---

A request is considered “authenticated” when the backend can securely identify the user and device that is making the request. Reasons for making authenticated requests to the backend include:

- Associating the user with the action being performed
- Ensuring the user has permission to make the request
- Keeping an audit log of which device the user is performing actions from

To authenticate requests when using a Clerk SDK, you must pass Clerk's short-lived [session token](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens) to your server. The session token contains cryptographically signed claims about the user's identity and authentication state. [Read more about making requests](/docs/backend-requests/making-requests).

## Required headers

The following headers are required for Clerk to authenticate a request. It contains information that Clerk uses to determine whether a request is in a signed in or signed out state, or if a [handshake](/docs/how-clerk-works/overview#the-handshake) must be performed.

- [`Authorization`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization): This should include the user's session token as a Bearer token.
- [`Accept`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept)
- [`Host`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Host)
- [`Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin)
- [`Referer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer)
- [`Sec-Fetch-Dest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Dest)
- [`User-Agent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent)
- [`X-Forwarded-Host`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Host)
- [`X-Forwarded-Proto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Proto)
  - Alternatively, you can use [`CloudFront-Forwarded-Proto`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/adding-cloudfront-headers.html#cloudfront-headers-other)
