title: Cookie size limits
description: Learn about cookie size limits and how to stay within them with Clerk.

All modern browsers [limit the maximum size of a cookie to 4kb](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2109#section-6.3).

The Clerk [session token](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens) is stored in a Cookie, and is required for Clerk to function. Exceeding the 4kb max size can have adverse effects, including a possible infinite redirect loop for users who exceed this size in Next.js applications.

A session token with the [default session claims](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens#default-session-claims) will not run into this issue, as this configuration produces a Cookie significantly smaller than 4kb. Only when [customizing your session token](/docs/backend-requests/making/custom-session-token) or creating a [custom JWT template](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates) do you have to be mindful of this limitation.

It's recommended to move particularly large claims out of the JWT and fetch these using a separate API call from your backend. Notably, the `user.organizations` claim can often trigger the cookie exceeding 4kb.
