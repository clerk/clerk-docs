description: Learn how Clerk handles account linking during Enterprise SSO.
---

Account linking is the process of connecting multiple user accounts from different services or platforms, allowing users to access
various services with a single set of credentials. It enables seamless sign-in using Enterprise SSO alongside other authentication methods like username/password. Clerk automatically attempts to link accounts that share the same email address, assuming a single owner for each email.

## How it works

When a user attempts to sign in or sign up, Clerk checks if the email address from the Identity Provider (IdP) matches an existing account and attempts to link them. Email addresses from IdPs are considered verified by default.

The following sections describe different scenarios that can occur during this process and explain how Clerk handles each one.

### Email is verified in Clerk

When a user signs into your app using an IdP that returns a matching verified email address, Clerk automatically links the Enterprise account to the existing account and completes the sign-in process. This includes accounts protected by passwords, as the Enterprise sign-in flow automatically bypasses password verification.

### Email is not verified and verification isn't required

By default, Clerk requires email verification at sign-up. For instances that have disabled this behavior, there is a possibility that an account may be created using an unverified email address.

To configure email verification at sign-up:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Email, Phone, Username**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) page.
1. Next to **Email address**, select the settings icon and uncheck the **Verify at sign-up** toggle.

When a user signs into your app using an IdP, Clerk automatically links the Enterprise account to the existing account by **also verifying the existing email address** and signing the user in. This includes accounts protected by passwords, as the Enterprise sign-in flow automatically bypasses password verification.

### Email is not verified

When a user signs into your app using an IdP that returns a matching unverified email address, Clerk doesn't link the Enterprise account to the existing account, but instead signs the user up and creates a completely new account.
