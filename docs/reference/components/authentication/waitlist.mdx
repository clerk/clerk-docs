In **Waitlist** mode, users can register their interest in your app by joining a waitlist. This mode is ideal for apps in early development stages or those wanting to generate interest before launch. [Learn more about additional features available in **Waitlist** mode](/docs/guides/secure/restricting-access#waitlist).

The `<Waitlist />` component renders a form that allows users to join for early access to your app.

<If sdk="nextjs">
  > [!NOTE]
  > If you're using Next.js, the`<Waitlist />` component is available in `@clerk/nextjs@6.2.0` and above.
</If>

## Enable Waitlist mode

Before using the `<Waitlist />` component, you must enable **Waitlist** mode in the Clerk Dashboard:

<Include src="_partials/waitlist/enable-waitlist-mode" />

<If notSdk="js-frontend">
  ## Example

  > [!WARNING]
  > Before using the `<Waitlist />` component, you must provide the `waitlistUrl` prop either in the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/reference/components/clerk-provider#properties) or [`<SignIn />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in#properties) component to ensure proper functionality.

  The following example includes a basic implementation of the `<Waitlist />` component. You can use this as a starting point for your own implementation.

  <Include src="_partials/waitlist/waitlist-component-examples" />
