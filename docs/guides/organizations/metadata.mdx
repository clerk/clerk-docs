Organization metadata lets you store custom information about an organization that is not part of the standard fields, such as custom attributes that are specific to your application. This is useful for advanced user segmentation, analytics, or storing application-specific data like subscription tier, department, or region.

Metadata is stored on the [`Organization`](/docs/reference/javascript/organization) and [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/reference/javascript/organization-membership) objects.

## Types of metadata

There are two types of organization metadata: "public" and "private".

| Metadata | Frontend API | Backend API |
| - | - | - |
| Public | Read access | Read & write access |
| Private | No read or write access | Read & write access |

Both the [`Organization`](/docs/reference/javascript/organization) and [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/reference/javascript/organization-membership) objects have the metadata fields: `publicMetadata` and `privateMetadata`.

- Use the `publicMetadata` property if you need to set some metadata from your backend and have them displayed as read-only on the frontend.
- Use the `privateMetadata` property if the custom attributes contain sensitive information that should not be displayed on the frontend.

## Set organization metadata

You can set organization metadata in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations) or using Clerk's Backend API. See the [`updateOrganizationMetadata()`](/docs/reference/backend/organization/update-organization-metadata) and [`updateOrganizationMembershipMetadata()`](/docs/reference/backend/organization/update-organization-membership-metadata) methods for more information.

## Access public metadata

To access public metadata on the frontend, it's available on the [`Organization`](/docs/reference/javascript/organization) object, which can be accessed using the [`useOrganization()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-organization) hook.

To access public metadata on the backend, it's available on the [Backend `Organization`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization) object which can be accessed using the [`getOrganization()`](/docs/reference/backend/organization/get-organization) method. This method will return the `Organization` object which contains the public metadata. However, this method is subject to [rate limits](/docs/guides/how-clerk-works/system-limits#backend-api-requests), so _if you are accessing the metadata frequently_, it's recommended to [attach it to the user's session token](#metadata-in-the-session-token).

## Next steps

Now that you understand organization metadata, you can:

- [Use organization slugs in URLs](/docs/guides/organizations/org-slugs-in-urls) for tenant-specific routing
- [Add metadata to invitations](/docs/guides/organizations/invitations#invitation-metadata) to track invitation sources or assign attributes
- [Create and manage organizations](/docs/guides/organizations/create-and-manage) to see metadata in action
- [Check roles and permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/check-access) to control access based on metadata values
