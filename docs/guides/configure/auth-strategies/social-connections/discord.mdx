Enabling OAuth with [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Discord account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Discord**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Discord as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Discord**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create a Discord Developer app

  1. On a separate page, go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and sign in.
  1. In the top-right, select **New Application**.
  1. Complete the required fields and select **Create**. You'll be redirected to the **General Information** page.
  1. In the left sidenav, select **OAuth2**.
  1. Under **Redirects**, select **Add Redirect**. Paste the **Redirect URI** you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Save Changes**. You may need to tap anywhere on the screen for the button to show.
  1. Save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** somewhere secure. If you don't see the **Copy** button under the **Client Secret**, select **Reset Secret** to generate a new one.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ### Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/test-your-connection" />
</Steps>
