> [!WARNING]
> If your application previously had the **Invisible** CAPTCHA type selected, it's highly recommended to switch to the **Smart** option, as the **Invisible** option is deprecated.
> For newer applications, CAPTCHA type options are no longer shown in the Dashboard. Bot protection uses the **Smart** option by default and is enabled by turning on the **Bot sign-up protection** toggle only.
