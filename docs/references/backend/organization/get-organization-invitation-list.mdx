## Examples

### Basic

In this example, you can see that the returned [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) includes `data`, which is an array of [`OrganizationInvitation`](/docs/references/javascript/organization-invitation) objects, and `totalCount`, which indicates the total number of organization invitations in the system for the specified organization.

```tsx
const organizationId = 'org_2ZUtbk2yvnFGItdeze1ivCh3uqh';

const response = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationInvitationList({ organizationId });

console.log(response);
/*
{
  data: [
    _OrganizationInvitation {
      id: 'orginv_2b6b8BKxYmCdSNYtEBdk2aQSlyY',
      emailAddress: 'testclerk123@gmail.com',
      role: 'org:member',
      organizationId: 'org_2ZUtbk2yvnFGItdeze1ivCh3uqh',
      createdAt: 1705538313485,
      updatedAt: 1705538313485,
      status: 'pending',
      publicMetadata: {},
      privateMetadata: {}
    },
    _OrganizationInvitation {
      id: 'orginv_2b6SO8VwBMDn2IMYn0xqiaSxVpN',
      emailAddress: 'testclerk123@clerk.dev',
      role: 'org:member',
      organizationId: 'org_2ZUtbk2yvnFGItdeze1ivCh3uqh',
      createdAt: 1705534000014,
      updatedAt: 1705534817946,
      status: 'revoked',
      publicMetadata: {},
      privateMetadata: {}
    }
  ],
  totalCount: 2
}
*/
```

### Filter by invitation status

Retrieves organization invitation list that is filtered by the status of the invitation.

```tsx
const organizationId = 'org_123';

const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationInvitationList({
  organizationId,
  // returns a list of invitations that have not yet been accepted
  status: [ 'pending' ],
});
```

### Limit the number of results

Retrieves organization invitation list that is filtered by the number of results.

```tsx
const organizationId = 'org_123';

const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationInvitationList({
  organizationId,
  // returns the first 10 results
  limit: 10,
});
```

### Skip results

Retrieves organization invitation list that is filtered by the number of results to skip.

```tsx
const organizationId = 'my-organization-id';

const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationInvitationList({
  organizationId,
  // skips the first 10 results
  offset: 10,
});
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/organizations/{organization_id}/invitations`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organization-Invitations#operation/ListOrganizationInvitations) for more details.
