Updates an [`EmailAddress`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/email-address).

```ts
function updateEmailAddress(
  emailAddressId: string,
  params: UpdateEmailAddressParams,
): Promise<EmailAddress>
```

## `UpdateEmailAddressParams`

<Properties>
  - `primary?`
  - `boolean`

  Whether or not to set the email address as the user's primary email address.

  ---

  - `verified?`
  - `boolean`

  Whether or not the email address is verified.
</Properties>

## Example

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

```tsx {{ mark: [[12, 13]] }}
const emailAddressId = 'idn_123'

const params = { verified: false }

const response = await clerkClient.emailAddresses.updateEmailAddress(emailAddressId, params)
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `PATCH/email_addresses/{email_address_id}`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/email-addresses/patch/email_addresses/\{email_address_id}){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
