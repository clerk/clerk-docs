# Creating and Verifying a Domain

Domains can be added and verified under an organization by administrators. In order to enable this feature, make sure to enable verified domains in the dashboard's _Organization Settings > Verified domains_. The only parameter needed to to create an organization domain is the `name`.

Domains can be verified through an email verfication code sent to an email that uses the domain. If the administrator adding the domain already has a verified email using that domain in their account, the domain will be automatically verified.

An instance may only have one verified domain of same name, and an organization may only have one domain of the same name (verified or unverified).

# Enrollment Modes

Once a domain is created and verified, an administrator can choose between two enrollment modes to enable new ways for users to join organizations.

- `automatic invitations` - During sign up, a user will receive an invitation for the organization if their email's domain matches the verified domain. The user will join the organization if they accept the automatic invitation.
- `automatic suggestions` - During sign up, a user will receive a suggestion for the organization if their email's domain matches the verified domain. The user can request to join, and an administrator must accept this request before the user joins the organization.

# Usage

```tsx copy
const { organization, domains } = useOrganization();

// create domain
const domain = await organization.createDomain("example.com")

// prepare email verification
domain.prepareAffiliationVerification({affiliationEmailAddress: "foo@example.com"})

// attempt email verification
domain.attemptAffiliationVerification({code: "123456"})

// update domain enrollment mode
domain.updateEnrollmentMode({enrollmentMode: "automatic_invitation"})
```
