These steps apply to both `ClerkKitUI` and custom auth flows.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need your own domain for production.

<Steps>
  ## Start with the general Deploy to production guide

  Start with [Deploy to production](/docs/guides/development/deployment/production).
  After going through the general production steps, there are a few additional steps for iOS.

  ## Confirm your iOS app is registered in production

  Make sure your iOS app exists in the production instance under [**Native Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/native-applications).
  You will need your **App ID Prefix** and **Bundle ID**.

  ## Confirm allowlisted redirect URLs

  Verify that your production instance has the correct [allowlisted redirect URLs](/docs/guides/development/customize-redirect-urls) for your iOS app.
  By default, Clerk uses `{bundleIdentifier}://callback` as the redirect URL.

  ## Update Associated Domains

  In Xcode, update **Associated Domains** to use your production [Frontend API URL](!frontend-api-url):

  1. Under **Signing & Capabilities**, add or update the entry to `webcredentials:{YOUR_FRONTEND_API_URL}`.
  1. Use the production instance's Frontend API URL.

  ## Test on a physical device

  Build a release/TestFlight build with production keys and verify behavior.
