title: '`list()`'
description: Use Clerk's Backend SDK to get a list of machines for your application.
sdk: js-backend
---

Retrieves a list of machines for your application. Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) object with a `data` property that contains an array of Machine objects, and a `totalCount` property that indicates the total number of machines for the application. Results are sorted by descending creation date by default.

```ts
function list(params: GetMachineListParams = {}): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<Machine[]>>
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `limit?`
  - `number`

  The number of results to return. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than 501. Can be used for paginating the results together with `offset`. Defaults to `10`.

  ---

  - `offset?`
  - `number`

  Skip the first `offset` results when paginating. Needs to be an integer greater or equal to zero. To be used in conjunction with `limit`. Defaults to `0`.

  ---

  - `orderBy?`
  - `'name' | 'created_at'`

  Return machines in a particular order. Prefix with a `-` to reverse the order. Prefix with a `+` to list in ascending order. Defaults to `'+created_at'`.

  ---

  - `query?`
  - `string`

  Filters machines with ID or name that match the given query.

```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/machines`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/machines/get/machines){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
