Clerk supports multiple sign-up modes, giving you flexibility in managing user access to your application.

To configure sign-up modes:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerkstage.dev/last-active?path=user-authentication/restrictions).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then, in the sidebar, select **Restrictions**. 
1. Under the **Sign-up modes** section, you can enable one of the following options: 
    - **[Public](#public)**
    - **[Restricted](#restricted)**

## Public

In **Public** mode, the sign-up process is open to anyone. This mode is ideal for applications that want broad user access.

## Restricted

In **Restricted** mode, user access is controlled by the application admin(s). Users can be added to the application through [invitations](/docs/users/invitations) or [manual user creation](/docs/users/create-users). This mode is ideal for applications that are in private beta or internal tools.

Additional features available in **Restricted** mode:

- The [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component will keep the prompt to sign up hidden by default. This is to avoid confusion for users who don't have access.

- The [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) is accessible only to users who have been invited and have a valid invitation link. Users who don't have access will see a message indicating that they need an invitation to sign up.
