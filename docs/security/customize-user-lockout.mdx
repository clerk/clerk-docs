# Customize max sign-in attempts and duration of user lockout

Clerk provides an Account Lockout feature in order to protect user credentials against brute force attacks. You can customize the number of times a sign in can be attempted before the account is locked to prevent further sign-in attempts, and how long such a lockout lasts.

<Callout type="info">
  This feature is applicable to user accounts that use [passwords](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) or [backup codes](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/multi-factor).
</Callout>

1. In your Clerk Dashboard, navigate to **User & Authentication > [Attack Protection](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/attack-protection)**.
1. To change the number of failed attempts before a user is locked out, under **Maximum attempt limit,** enter a new number of failed attempts allowed. (The default is 100 attempts.)
1. To change the duration, under **Lockout duration,** select **Time limit**. Then, select the unit of time (minutes/hours/days/years) and enter the number of units you want lockouts to last.
1. Select **Save changes** to apply your settings.
