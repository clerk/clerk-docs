title: useSignUp()
description: Access and manage the current user's sign-up state in your React application with Clerk's useSignUp() hook.
sdk: chrome-extension, expo, nextjs, react, react-router, tanstack-react-start
---

The `useSignUp()` hook provides access to the [`SignUpFuture`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-up-future) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-up attempt and manage the sign-up flow. You can use this to create a [custom sign-up flow](!custom-flow).

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `signUp`
  - [`SignUpFuture`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-up-future)

  The current active `SignUpFuture` instance, for use in custom flows.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The `SignUpFuture` instance referenced by `signUp` does not have a stable identity, and will change as the sign-up flow progresses. Make sure you provide it in dependency arrays when using hooks such as `useEffect`, `useCallback`, or `useMemo`.

  ---

  - `errors`
  - [`Errors`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/errors)

  The errors that occurred during the last API request.

  ---

  - `fetchStatus`
  - `'idle' | 'fetching'`

  The fetch status of the underlying `SignUpFuture` resource.
</Properties>
