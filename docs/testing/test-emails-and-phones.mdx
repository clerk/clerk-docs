# Test emails and phones

Most of Clerk's sign-in and sign-up flows involve verifying ownership of an email address or phone number via a [one time passcode (OTP)](/docs/custom-flows/email-sms-otp). To confirm that your integration works correctly, you can simulate verification flows without sending an email or SMS, by using reserved values in test mode.

Verification messages are used during sign-up, sign-in, and when adding an email address or phone number to an existing account.

## Setup test mode

Every development instance has "test mode" enabled by default. If you need to use "test mode" on a production instance, you can enable it via the Clerk Dashboard or via the Backend API.

<Callout type="warning">
  You should not be using "test mode" on any instance that manages actual customers.

### Test mode via the Clerk Dashboard

To enable test mode via the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the **Settings** page in the Clerk Dashboard. In the **Enable test mode** section, ensure the toggle is toggled on.

## How to use test mode

Once test mode is enabled, all you need to do is use the following test numbers as part of your standard flow.

### Email addresses

Any email with the `+clerk_test` subaddress is a test email address. No emails will be sent, and they can be verified with the code `424242`.

For example:

`jane+clerk_test@example.com`

`doe+clerk_test@example.com`

### Phone numbers

Any [fictional phone number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_(telephone_number)) is a test phone number. No SMS will be sent, and they can all be verified with the code `424242`.

Fictional phone numbers have the following structure:

`+1 (XXX) 555-0100` to `+1 (XXX) 555-0199`

For example:

`+12015550100`

`+19735550133`

### Email links

Testing email links in E2E suites is an uphill task. We recommend turning on [email verification codes](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#verification-methods), and using that flow to authenticate your tests. The flows are very similar.

## Code examples

### Testing sign in via email code

```jsx
const testSignInWithEmailCode = async () => {
  const { signIn } = useSignIn();

  const emailAddress = "john+clerk_test@example.com";
  const signInResp = await signIn.create({ identifier: emailAddress });
  const { emailAddressId } = signInResp.supportedFirstFactors.find(
    (ff) =>
      ff.strategy === "email_code" && ff.safeIdentifier === emailAddress
  )! as EmailCodeFactor;

  await signIn.prepareFirstFactor({
    strategy: "email_code",
    emailAddressId: emailAddressId,
  });

  const attemptResponse = await signIn.attemptFirstFactor({
    strategy: "email_code",
    code: "424242",
  });

  if (attemptResponse.status == "complete") {
    console.log("success");
  } else {
    console.log("error");
  }
};
```

### Testing sign up with phone number

```jsx
const testSignUpWithPhoneNumber = async () => {
  const { signUp } = useSignUp();

  await signUp.create({
    phoneNumber: "+12015550100",
  });
  await signUp.preparePhoneNumberVerification();

  const res = await signUp.attemptPhoneNumberVerification({
    code: "424242",
  });
  if (res.verifications.phoneNumber.status == "verified") {
    console.log("success");
  } else {
    console.log("error");
  }
};
```
