<Steps>
  ## Create a new Nuxt App

  If you don't already have a Nuxt app, run the following commands to [create a new one](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/installation).

  ```npm
  npm create nuxt@latest clerk-nuxt
  cd clerk-nuxt
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  ## Install `@clerk/nuxt`

  The [Clerk Nuxt SDK](/docs/reference/nuxt/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, Vue composables, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  ```npm
  npm install @clerk/nuxt
  ```

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  <Include src="_partials/quickstarts/set-clerk-api-keys" />

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  NUXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  NUXT_CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ## Configure `nuxt.config.ts`

  To enable Clerk in your Nuxt app, add `@clerk/nuxt` to your modules array in `nuxt.config.ts`. This automatically configures Clerk's middleware and plugins and imports Clerk's components.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'nuxt.config.ts', mark: [2] }}
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: ['@clerk/nuxt'],
  })
  ```

  ## Create a header with Clerk components

  Nuxt 3 automatically imports and makes all components in the `components/` directory globally available without requiring explicit imports. See the [Nuxt docs](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/auto-imports) for details.

  You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/reference/components/overview#control-components).

  The following example creates a header using the following components:

  <Include src="_partials/quickstarts/create-header-components" />

  ```vue {{ filename: 'app/app.vue', mark: [2, [6, 13]] }}
  <script setup lang="ts">
  // Components are automatically imported
  </script>

  <template>
    <header>
      {/* Show the sign-in button when the user is signed out */}
      <SignedOut>
        <SignInButton />
        <SignUpButton />
      </SignedOut>
      {/* Show the user button when the user is signed in */}
      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton />
      </SignedIn>
    </header>

    <main>
      <NuxtPage />
    </main>
  </template>
  ```

  <Include src="_partials/quickstarts/run-project" />

  <Include src="_partials/quickstarts/create-first-user" />
