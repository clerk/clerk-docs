# Bot Protection

To protect your Sign Ups from Bots, Clerk leverages data from our CDN to determine whether a user attempting to sign up might be a bot or not.  

Clerk offers two captcha display modes:
- **Smart** - Will only show the captcha widget if bot traffic is suspected
- **Invisible** - Will never show the captcha widget

When set to **Smart**, users suspected of being a bot will be shown a visible challenge (like clicking a checkbox), in an attempt to verify they are human. When set to **Invisible**, users suspected to be a bot will not be allowed to sign up, and are shown an error message instructing them to reach out to your configured support email address.

To configure Bot Protection for your Sign Ups, head to the [Attack Protection](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/attack-protection) section of the Clerk Dashboard.

## Limitations
- Visual Captcha is primarily used in Web environments, and in some native contexts may not work.
- If you are re-implementing Sign Ups with a [Custom Flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview) and have activated "Smart" display, then you need to ensure you have added a DOM node for the visible challenge. More in this [Custom Flow guide](/docs/custom-flows/bot-sign-up-protection)
