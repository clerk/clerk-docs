> [!WARNING]
> The Clerk iOS SDK is currently in beta. It is **not yet recommended for production use**.

This guide will teach you how to add native Sign in with Apple to your Clerk apps on Apple platforms.

<Steps>
  ### Configure the Apple social connection

  To support native Sign in with Apple, you need to configure the Apple social connection in the Clerk Dashboard. To do so, follow the **native-specific instructions** in the [OAuth with Apple guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/apple).

  ### Add the Sign in with Apple capability to your app

  [Add the Sign in with Apple capability to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-sign-in-with-apple#Add-the-Sign-in-with-Apple-capability-to-your-app).

  ### Obtain an Apple ID Credential

  To authenticate with Apple and Clerk, you need to obtain an [Apple ID Credential](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidcredential).

  To obtain an Apple ID Credential, you can do one of the following:

  - Use one of [Apple's built-in Sign in with Apple buttons](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/displaying_sign_in_with_apple_buttons_in_your_app).
  - Obtain it manually by following [the Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/)

  > [!NOTE]
  > You must set the nonce property of the `ASAuthorizationAppleIDRequest` when requesting an Apple ID Credential in order to authenticate with Clerk.

  ### Build your sign-in flow

  Once you have obtained your [Apple ID Credential](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidcredential), you can use it to authenticate with Clerk by calling [`SignIn.signInWithAppleIdToken()`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/clerk/clerk-ios/main/documentation/clerksdk/signin/#type-methods).

  The following example uses Apple's built-in `SignInWithAppleButton` to obtain an Apple ID Credential and calls `SignIn.signInWithAppleIdToken()` to authenticate with Clerk.

  ```swift {{ filename: 'SignInWithAppleView.swift' }}
  import SwiftUI
  import ClerkSDK
  import AuthenticationServices

  struct SignInWithAppleView: View {
    var body: some View {
      // Use Apple's built-in SignInWithAppleButton
      SignInWithAppleButton { request in
        request.requestedScopes = [.email, .fullName]
        request.nonce = UUID().uuidString // Setting the nonce is mandatory
      } onCompletion: { result in
        Task {
          // Access the Apple ID Credential
          guard let credential = try result.get().credential as? ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential else {
            dump("Unable to get credential of type ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential")
            return
          }

          // Access the necessary identity token on the Apple ID Credential
          guard let idToken = credential.identityToken.flatMap({ String(data: $0, encoding: .utf8) }) else {
            dump("Unable to get ID token from Apple ID Credential.")
            return
          }

          // Authenticate with Clerk
          let authResult = try await SignIn
            .create(strategy: .idToken(provider: .apple, idToken: idToken))
            .authenticateWithIdToken()
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</Steps>
