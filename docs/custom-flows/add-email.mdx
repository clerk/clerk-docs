Users are able to add multiple email addresses to their account. Adding an email address requires the user to verify the email address before it can be added to the user's account.

This guide demonstrates how to build a custom user interface that allows users to add and verify an email address for their account.

## Configure email verification

There are two verification methods available for email addresses:

- Email code verification: Users receive an email with a **verification code** to verify their email address.
- Email link verification: Users receive an email with a **verification link** to verify their email address.

By default, the verification method that is enabled is email code verification. To use email code verification, skip to the [Email code verification](#email-code-verification) section.

To use email links, you must configure the following settings in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. On the [**Email, phone, username**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) page of the Clerk Dashboard, next to **Email address**, select the settings icon. A modal will open.
1. Under **Verification methods**, enable the **Email verification link** option. By default, **Require the same device and browser** is enabled, which means that email links are required to be verified from the same device and browser on which the sign-up or sign-in was initiated. For this guide, leave this setting enabled.
1. Uncheck the box for **Email verification code**.
1. Select **Continue** to save your changes.

Then skip to the [Email link verification](#email-link-verification) section.

## Email code verification

1. Every user has a [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user) object that represents their account. The `User` object has a `emailAddresses` property that contains all the email addresses associated with the user. The [`useUser()`](/docs/hooks/use-user) hook is used to get the `User` object.
1. The [`User.createEmailAddress()`](/docs/references/javascript/user#create-email-address) method is used to add the email address to the user's account. A new [`EmailAddress`](/docs/references/javascript/types/email-address) object is created and stored in `User.emailAddresses`.
1. The `prepareVerification()` method is used on the newly created `EmailAddress` object to send a verification code to the user.
1. The `attemptVerification()` method is used on the same `EmailAddress` object with the verification code provided by the user to verify the email address.
