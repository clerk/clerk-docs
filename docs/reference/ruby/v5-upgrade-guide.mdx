In January 2026, version 5.0 of the Clerk Ruby SDK was released. This guide covers the breaking changes that were introduced.

## Available methods and operations updates

With the introduction of v5, we have deprecated our generated Ruby HTTP Client.

The `Clerk::SDK` class methods are now generated from the [Clerk OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/clerk/openapi-specs){{ target: '_blank' }} in the gem itself.

This comes with a number of changes to the method names, parameters, and responses. Please refer to the [Available Resources and Operations](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-ruby?tab=readme-ov-file#available-resources-and-operations){{ target: '_blank' }} section for more details on the changes required.
