description: Learn how to read session & user data in Expo with Clerk.

This guide demonstrates how to access active session and user data in your Expo application.

## Session data example

{/* TODO: Keep in sync with _partials/hooks/use-auth */}

The [`useAuth()`](/docs/hooks/use-auth){{ target: '_blank' }} hook provides information about the current auth state, as well as helper methods to manage the current active session. The hook returns `userId`, which can be used to protect your routes, as shown in the following example:

```tsx {{ filename: 'components/UseAuthExample.tsx' }}
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'
import { Text } from 'react-native'

export default function UseAuthExample() {
  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, userId, sessionId, getToken } = useAuth()

  if (!isLoaded) {
    return <Text>Loading...</Text>
  }

  if (!isSignedIn) {
    // You could also add a redirect to the sign-in page here
    return <Text>Sign in to view this page</Text>
  }

  return (
    <Text>
      Hello, {userId}! Your current active session is {sessionId}.
    </Text>
  )
}
```

## User data example

{/* TODO: Keep in sync with _partials/hooks/use-user */}

The [`useUser()`](/docs/hooks/use-user){{ target: '_blank' }} hook enables you to access the [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user) object, which contains the current user's data such as their full name.

The following example demonstrates how to use `useUser()` to check if the user is signed in and display their first name:

```tsx {{ filename: 'src/Example.tsx' }}
import { useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'
import { Text } from 'react-native'

export default function Example() {
  const { isSignedIn, user, isLoaded } = useUser()

  if (!isLoaded) {
    return <Text>Loading...</Text>
  }

  if (!isSignedIn) {
    return <Text>Sign in to view this page</Text>
  }

  return <Text>Hello {user.firstName}!</Text>
}
```
