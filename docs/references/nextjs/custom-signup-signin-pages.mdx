title: Build your own sign-in and sign-up pages for your Next.js app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add custom sign-in and sign-up pages to your Next.js app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) and [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) components with the [Next.js optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments) in order to build custom sign-in and sign-up pages for your Next.js app.

If the prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

<Steps>
  ### Build a sign-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx' }}
  import { SignUp } from '@clerk/nextjs'

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignUp />
  }
  ```

  ### Build a sign-in page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx' }}
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignIn />
  }
  ```

  ### Make the sign-up and sign-in routes public

  By default, `clerkMiddleware()` makes all routes public. **This step is specifically for applications that have configured `clerkMiddleware()` to make [all routes protected](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#protect-all-routes).** If you have not configured `clerkMiddleware()` to protect all routes, you can skip this step.

  To make the sign-up and sign-in routes public:

  - Navigate to your `middleware.ts` file.
  - Create a new [route matcher](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#create-route-matcher) that matches the sign-up and sign-in routes, or you can add them to an existing route matcher that is making routes public.
  - Create a check to see if the user's current route is a public route. If it is not a public route, use [`auth.protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) to protect the route.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
  import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/sign-in(.*)', '/sign-up(.*)'])

  export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, request) => {
    if (!isPublicRoute(request)) {
      await auth.protect()
    }
  })

  export const config = {
    matcher: [
      // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
      '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
      // Always run for API routes
      '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
    ],
  }
  ```

  ### Update your environment variables

  Update your environment variables to point to your custom sign-in and sign-up pages. Learn more about the available [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables).

  ```env {{ filename: '.env.local' }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
  ```

  ### Visit your new pages

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom pages locally at [localhost:3000/sign-in](http://localhost:3000/sign-in) and [localhost:3000/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/sign-up).
