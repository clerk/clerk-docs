# Overview

## This page will walk you through how to create an organizational workspace, transfer your Clerk apps, and allow collaborators access to your organization's Clerk dashboard

### To make this possible we'll need to complete the following steps:
    1. Create an organizational workspace.
    
    2. Transfer our app into the recently created workspace.
    
    3. Invite collaborators to your organizational workspace and select their roles within the organization.

### Creating an organizational workspace in the Clerk dashboard:

    1. Login to the Clerk dashboard.

    2. In the top left corner, select your "Personal Workspace", and you'll see a option to create an organization.

    3. Create your organization by providing a name and an optional organization logo. Organizational slugs are unique across instances, so common organization naming conventions may already be in use for another instance.
    
    4. After creating the organization, we'll set the recently created organization as the active one instead of your personal workspace.  

### Transferring our app into the organizational workspace:
    
    1. Select the app you wish to transfer to open up the dashboard.
    
    2. On the left hand side, under "Application" select "Settings".
    
    3. From there, select the option to "Transfer Ownership" of your app.
    
    4. Under "New Owner", select your newly created organization,type in your application name to confirm the transfer request, and select "Transfer Ownership".

### Invite collaborators to your organizational workspace:
    
    1. In the Clerk dashboard, select your organizational workspace in the top left and click on the cogwheel that appears to the right of the organization. This will result in a organizational modal to pop up.
    
    2. In the modal, tab over to members and click the invite button on the right hand side.
    
    3. Enter the email address of the collaborator you wish to invite and select their respective role for your organization. If inviting multiple collaborators at a time, enter or paste email addresses, seperated by spaces or commas.
