Enabling [Solana](https://solana.com/solana-wallets) as a Web3 provider allows your users to sign in and up to your Clerk application with their Solana enabled wallet.

While we allow users to sign in with specific Web3 wallets (e.g., Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask), these methods all rely on the wallet's [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) address. With **Sign in with Solana**, users instead are prompted to choose their preferred Solana wallet provider and authenticate using their Solana wallet address. This means the sign-in flow isn't tied to any single wallet app; users can select whichever Solana wallet they prefer, unlike the other Web3 authentication strategies that  depend on specific Ethereum-based wallets.

## Enable Solana as a Web3 provider

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Web3**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/web3) page.
1. From the list of web3 providers, enable **Solana**.

## Test authentication

The simplest way to test authentication is to visit your Clerk application's [Account Portal](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/account-portal), which is available for all Clerk applications out-of-the-box.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/account-portal) page.
1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:
   - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
   - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
1. On the sign-in page, you should see **Solana** as an option. Use it to sign in.

## Collect additional user information during sign-up (optional)

Web3 applications integrating Solana typically use the `base58` encoded wallet address to identify users, which offers a high level of privacy, given the private key is required to sign transactions and is stored in the user's Web3 wallet. However, when bridging the gap between Web3 and Web2, it's often necessary to gather human-readable information about the user, such as their email address, phone number, or a username.

To collect additional information about your user during sign-up:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**User & authentication**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/user-and-authentication) page.
1. On this page, enable the attributes you want to collect from your user during sign-up.

## Connect Solana to existing account

Users can connect their Solana enabled wallet to their account at any time through their user profile page. You can configure your application to use the [Account Portal user profile page](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/account-portal#user-profile) or the prebuilt [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/reference/components/user/user-profile) component.
