The **[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)** is an open standard that lets large language model (LLM), like Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, VS Code, Zed, and other clients **securely access user data from external services** with the user's permission. Instead of asking users to sign in separately, MCP allows these AI apps to request permission to access specific data, such as emails or private GitHub repositories, directly through the app being used.
