description: Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Next.js application.

# Overview

Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your Next.js application. Looking to get started? Check out our [getting started guide](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs). If you want to learn more about the capabilities and methods available from Clerk's Next.js SDK, check out the reference content below.

## `authMiddleware()`

The `authMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Next.js application through middleware. It allows you to integrate authorization into both the client and server of your application. You can learn more [here](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware).

## Client-side helpers

Because Clerk Next.js is a wrapper around Clerk React, you can utilize the hooks that Clerk React provides. These hooks give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object, and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. You can learn more about these hooks [here](/docs/references/react/use-user).

{/* Another option for copy. However, this list could be a debt problem; e.g. if we added more hooks in the future, this list would need to be updated as well.

Clerk provides several helpers for integrating authentication into your Next.js application's client-side code.

- [`useUser()`](/docs/references/react/use-user)
- [`useClerk()`](/docs/references/react/use-clerk)
- [`useAuth()`](/docs/references/react/use-auth)
- [`useSignIn()`](/docs/references/react/use-sign-in)
- [`useSignUp()`](/docs/references/react/use-sign-up)
- [`useSession()`](/docs/references/react/use-session)
- [`useSessionList()`](/docs/references/react/use-session-list)
- [`useOrganization()`](/docs/references/react/use-organization)
- [`useOrganizationList()`](/docs/references/react/use-organization-list)

## App Router

Clerk provides first-class support for the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app). The below methods and references show how to integrate Clerk features into applications that take advantage of the latest App Router and React Server Components features.

- [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth)
- [`currentUser()`](/docs/references/nextjs/current-user)
- [Route Handlers](/docs/references/nextjs/route-handlers)
- [Server Actions](/docs/references/nextjs/server-actions)

## Pages Router

Clerk continues to provide drop-in support for the Next.js Pages Router. In addition to the main Clerk integration, several methods are available for instrumenting authentication within Pages Router-based applications.

- [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth)
- [`buildClerkProps()`](/docs/references/nextjs/build-clerk-props)
