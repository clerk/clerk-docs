# Transferring ownership of your application
To transfer your application, head to the [Settings view](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=settings) within the Clerk Dashboard and select `Transfer Ownership`. From here you can transfer an application to your "Personal Account" or any Organization where you are an admin. 


## Transferring to an Org that does not have any billing methods

To ensure continuity in your subscription, an application with an existing paid subscription can only be transferred to an Organization with active payment methods. Some customers attempt to transfer ownership to a brand new Organization and expect the payment details to transfer but unfortunately this type of transfer is not allowed by our payment provider. 

To overcome this limitation, we ask that you establish a payment method on the receiving Organization first, and then re-attempt your transfer. 

To establish a payment method, without being charged:
- Use the Organization Switcher in the Dashboard and select the "cog" icon to manage the organization.
- Use the sidebar to navigate to the "Billing" section of the modal.
- Click the banner that says "Upgrade to unlimited members". **This won't actually charge you anything immediately**. It's just a way to ensure billing information is added to the organization and you won't actually be charged anything.
- Once that billing information is added, you will be able to transfer the app over without issue.

    We're actively working on making this process easier within the Clerk Dashboard. This guide is meant to be a helpful workaround until that work is deployed.
