<Include src="_partials/billing/billing-experimental" />

The `CommercePlan` object is similar to the [`BillingPlanResource`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/billing-plan-resource) object as it holds information about a Plan, as well as methods for managing it. However, the `CommercePlan` object is different in that it is used in the [Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/model/commerceplan){{ target: '_blank' }} and is not directly accessible from the Frontend API.
