# `<Protect />`

The `<Protect />` component only renders content that a user with [a Role with the correct Permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions) can access.

## Usage

You can pass either a `role` or `permission` to `<Protect />` to limit who can see the content it renders. If you do not pass either prop, `<Protect />` behaves the same as [`<SignedIn />`](/docs/components/control/signed-in) and will render its children if the user is signed in, regardless of their Role or its Permissions.

For more complex authorization logic, pass conditional logic to the `condition` prop.

### Render content by Role

The children of the following component will only be visible to users with the `admin` Role.

<Tabs type="framework" items={["Next.js", "React"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```jsx
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          role="org:admin"
          fallback={<p>Only an admin can access this content.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```jsx
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/react";

    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          role="org:admin"
          fallback={<p>Only an admin can access this content.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Render content by Permissions

The children of the following component will only be visible to users with Roles that have `domains:read` Permissions.

<Tabs type="framework" items={["Next.js", "React"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```jsx
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect 
          permission="org:domains:read"
          fallback={<p>You do not have the permissions to access this.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```jsx
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/react";

    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect 
          permission="org:domains:read"
          fallback={<p>You do not have the permissions to access this.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="warning">
  Be sure to prefix all Roles and Permissions with `org:`.
</Callout>
