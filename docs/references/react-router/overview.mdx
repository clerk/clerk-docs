The Clerk React Router SDK gives you access to prebuilt components, React hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier. Refer to the [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/react-router) to get started.

## Client-side helpers

Because the React Router SDK is built on top of the [React SDK](/docs/references/react/overview), you can use the hooks that the React SDK provides. These hooks include access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk) object, [`User` object](/docs/references/javascript/user), [`Organization` object](/docs/references/javascript/organization), and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. Learn more in the [React SDK reference](/docs/references/react/overview).

## Server-side helpers

The following references show how to integrate Clerk features into applications using React Router server functions and API routes.

- [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/react-router/get-auth)
- [`rootAuthLoader()`](/docs/references/react-router/root-auth-loader)

## React Router implementations

React Router can be integrated with Clerk in two ways:

- As a framework (recommended): Configure your app using [Clerk's React Router SDK](/docs/quickstarts/react-router)
- As a library: Manually integrate React Router into your React + Vite app using [library mode](/docs/references/react-router/library-mode)
