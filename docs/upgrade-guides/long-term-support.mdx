title: Long Term Support Policy
description: Clerk's policy for supporting past major versions of our SDKs
---

When a new major version of an official Clerk SDK is released, the previous version is placed into long term support (LTS) mode for a period of *one year*. During this period, new features and bugfixes will not be actively backported, however, any security patches or other critical fixes will be actively backported.

After the LTS period ends, there will be no further changes to the code for that version in any form, and we will strongly recommend upgrading to a new version for product and security improvements. While we strongly recommend upgrading to keep your application secure, all previous versions of SDKs will continue to function indefinitely even if not upgraded.
