# Email and SMS templates

Clerk provides a templating system that allows you to customize the default system email and SMS messages sent during authentication flows.

The template editor enables you to change the wording and styling so that it is more consistent with your own branding.

It is also a useful way to translate the content to another target language in the case that English is not the default locale of your application.

## Before you start

### Terminology

It will be useful to take a look at the following terms as they will reappear in the rest of the guide:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| template name | User-friendly name of the template. This will be visible on the template listing page. |
| variables | Also known as merge tags in the context of email marketing, these are placeholders that are replaced with dynamic data when the actual email or SMS is being sent to the recipient. |
| WYSIWYG | Stands for 'What You See Is What You Get.' This term is used for editors and design tools that allow you create content or layout in a visual manner (i.e. without requiring you to edit the underlying markup) so that you can instantly see how the result is going to display to your users. |
| blocks | Email WYSIWYG editors enable you to use blocks, rows, and columns in order to control the layout of their content (this is then transpiled to table-based HTML). |

### Revolvapp WYSIWYG email editor plugin

The email editor uses the [Revolvapp](https://imperavi.com/revolvapp) email template editor plugin by Imperavi. To acquaint yourself with the template markup syntax, please consult the corresponding [documentation page](https://imperavi.com/revolvapp/docs/syntax/quick-start).

As you will see, the template markup is an HTML-like language and each type of node supports its own set of attributes which control its behavior. A lot of the attributes are borrowed from HTML itself.

Revolvapp allows the user to design the template using blocks and under the hood transpiles its markup to table-based HTML so that the resulting email renders consistently across email clients.

### Handlebars templating language

Both the email and SMS editor use the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templating language for the interpolation of dynamic values into your content via variables. It is a well established language, especially popular in the Javascript ecosystem, which has been adopted by leading Email Service Providers (ESPs) for templating as well.

The most core Handlebars concept you should bear in mind is that in order to output a variable, you should wrap its name within double curly braces. For example: `{{app.name}}`. When the message is to be sent, this will be replaced with the actual name of the application.

Using the variable insertion widgets, the variables will be inserted into the content at the desired position, so there is no need to write them by hand. Though, you can still do so if you like.

For further information on Handlebars, we recommend you take a look at the [official guides](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/).

There will definitely be a learning curve before you master both Revolvapp syntax and Handlebars, but there's no doubt that you will be crafting beautiful templates in no time!

<Callout type="info">
  In order to unescape special characters, you may need to wrap variables in triple curly braces. For example: `{{{app.name}}}`. This will allow special characters (e.g. `'`, `&`) to appear as displayed and not as escaped HTML entities (e.g. `&apos;`, `&amp;`).

## Template operations

Please consult the following sub-sections to see which operations are available in the template editor.

<Callout type="info">
  Depending on the state of the template and the current application subscription plan, one or more operations may not not available.
</Callout>

### Edit

Editing templates allows you to customize existing Clerk-sent emails and SMS messages to make them more inline with your own branding.

Templates are editable:

- On the development instance of applications on any subscription plan (free or paid)
- On the staging and production instances of paid plans

This allows you freely test the templating feature on your development environment to see if it fits your individual use case before deciding on a plan upgrade.

To learn more about editing email templates, refer to the [Edit email templates](#edit-email-templates) section.

To learn more about editing SMS templates, refer to the [Edit SMS templates](#edit-sms-templates) section.

### Preview

The **Preview** operation enables you to get an idea of how the template will render when sent to the recipient. This is useful for sampling your changes without actually having to commit them first.

To trigger a preview of a template, select the **Preview** button at the bottom left of the dashboard.

In email templates, the `app_logo` and `copyright` sections (if present) will be replaced with their actual markup in this view. For both emails & SMS, the template variables will be replaced with sample values.

Previewing is available for all templates.

### Reset

While editing a template, you can undo all changes since the last save by selecting the **Reset** button at the bottom right of the dashboard.

Template reset is applicable to editable templates.

### Revert

If you override a Clerk-provided template with your own customizations, you can always roll back to the system default template version by selecting the **Revert** button at the bottom left of the dashboard.

This can be useful if you want to start over from scratch.

<Callout type="info">
  Your current changes will be lost, so make sure you mean to discard them prior to reverting. You will be asked to confirm your choice to prevent an unintentional action.
</Callout>

### Copy to another instance of the same application

If your application has more than one instance, you can copy the current state of the editor to another instance.

This is especially useful for promoting changes from your development or staging environment to production after you have tested them.

To copy to another instance, you will need to first select the **Copy** button in the bottom left of the dashboard. Then, from the sub-menu, select the target instance.

<Callout type="warning">
  The copy icon will not appear if there are no other instances available on your application.
</Callout>

Since this change will override the current state of the template on the target instance, you will be asked to confirm your choice.

## Edit email templates

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=customization/email).

4. Once you have selected a template, you will be presented with the [template settings](#email-template-settings) & [the WYSIWYG editor](#email-wysiwyg-editor).

### Email template settings

The following settings can be changed for an email template:

#### Delivered by Clerk

Out of the box, Clerk will deliver your emails using its own Email Service Provider (ESP), which is currently [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/). However, if you wish to handle delivery of emails on your own, then you can toggle **Delivered by Clerk** off.

This means that Clerk will no longer be sending this particular email and in order to deliver it yourself, you will need to listen to the `emails.created` webhook and extract the necessary info from the event payload.

<Callout type="info">
  Remember, this is a per-template setting and will not be applied to other templates.
</Callout>

#### Name

**Name** is the template name and represents a human-friendly name for identifying the template on the template listing page. It does not affect the outgoing email in any way.

#### Send from

Clerk will populate the **From** email address with:

`<local part>@<your-domain>`

The local part depends on the type of email sent ('verification code', 'invitation', etc).

If you wish to override the local part with your own value, such as 'accounting', 'sales', etc., then set that value in the provided input.

### Email WYSIWYG editor

The email WYSIWYG editor is split into two parts:

- [The toolbar](#toolbar-controls)
- [The text area](#text-area-controls)

Since the toolbar exposes quite a few tools, we will examine them in more detail in the following sub-sections.

<Images

src="/docs/images/authentication/email-sms-options/WYSIWYG-editor.jpg"
alt="The 'WYSIWG' editor with a red box around the toolbar and a red box around the text area. Both sections are labeled accordingly."
/>

#### Toolbar controls

The toolbar is located at the top of the editor and contains the following controls, in order from left to right:

- **Shortcut** button - Opens a popup with the keyboard shortcuts that the editor supports.
- **Mobile view** toggle - Shows how the email will render on a mobile device with a portrait aspect ratio. Select the mobile view toggle again to return to desktop view.
- **HTML mode** toggle - Switches the editor to source mode. The source format is Revolvapp's own template syntax as mentioned in the [Before you start](/docs/authentication/configuration/email-sms-templates#handlebars-templating-language) section. For this tool to appear, you will need to unselect any currently selected block. To exit HTML/source mode, select the toggle again.
- **Background** button - Allows selecting a color or image as a background for the currently selected block.
- **Settings** button - Opens a popup with settings contextually based on the selected block or text.

For the following controls to appear, you will need to select an existing element in the text area. These controls will not be visible otherwise.

- **Add block** button - Allows you to insert a new block of content. For the button to appear, you will need to select the existing block below which you would like the new block to be inserted. The editor comes with a number of predefined blocks such as blocks with a header, image, button, multiple columns, etc.
- **Alignment** button - Enables horizontal alignment (left, right or center). For the button to appear, you will need to select an element that can be aligned, such as a text node.
- **Link** button - Converts a selected text fragment into a link. Users can configure the link text and the URL that the link should point to. For the button to appear, you will need to select an element that can be turned into a link, such as a text node.
- **Text color** button - Exposes a color picker so that you can select the color of the fonts in the affected block or text fragment. For the button to appear, you will need to select inside a text node.
- **Variable** button - Shows a dropdown with the available variables for the current template. For the button to appear, you will need to select inside a text node. Upon insertion, the variable will be automatically wrapped in curly braces; there is no need to add them yourself.
- **Border** button - Permits setting a border width, color and radius on a given block. Using the radius you can give a block rounded corners. For the button to appear, you will need to select an element that allows borders, such as a button.

#### Text area controls

The email WYSIWYG editor text area is intended mainly for authoring content. Though, if you select a block, a set of tools will also appear. In order from top to bottom, these are:

- **Move handle** - Allows the selected block to be moved up or down with regard to its sibling blocks
- **Delete** - Removes the block from the template
- **Clone** - Clones the block using the exact same settings

## Edit SMS templates

4. Once you have selected a template, you will be presented with the [template settings](#sms-template-settings) & [the text area](#sms-text-area).

### SMS template settings

The following settings can be changed for an SMS template:

#### Delivered by Clerk

Out of the box, Clerk will deliver your SMS messagess using its own SMS Gateway. However, if you wish to handle SMS delivery on your own, then you can toggle **Delivery by Clerk** off.

This means that Clerk will no longer be sending this particular SMS and in order to deliver it yourself, you will need to listen to the `sms.created` webhook and extract the necessary info from the event payload.

<Callout type="info">
  Remember, this is a per-template setting and will not be applied to other templates.
</Callout>

#### Name

**Name** is the template name and represents a human-friendly name for identifying the template on the template listing page. It does not affect the outgoing SMS message in any way.

### SMS text area

The text area is where you can author the content of the SMS message.

#### Insert variables

To insert a variable at the current cursor position, select the corresponding variable badge adjacent to the text area.

<Callout type="info">
  The **Invitation** template supports public invitation metadata, whereas the **Verification code** template supports public user metadata (in the case that a user already exists).
</Callout>

You can interpolate a particular metadata key as follows:

`{{invitation.public_metadata.foo.bar}}`
