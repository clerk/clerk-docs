</TutorialHero>

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For specific domains**.
1. Below EASIE, select **Google** as the identity provider.
1. Add the **Specific Domain** that you want to allow this connection for. This is the domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your application.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials, which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your Google Developer account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

<Steps>
  ### Set up an enterprise connection in Clerk

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
  1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
  1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For specific domains**.
  1. Below EASIE, select **Google** as the identity provider.
  1. Add the **Specific Domain** that you want to allow this connection for. This is the domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your application.
  1. Ensure that **Use custom credentials** is toggled on.

  ### Create a Google Developer project

  1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  1. Select a project or [create a new one](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate).
  1. If the **APIs & Services** page isn't already open, open the menu on the left and select **APIs & Services**.
  1. In the menu on the left, select **Credentials**.
  1. Select **Create Credentials**. Then, select **OAuth client ID.** You may need to [configure your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en#userconsent\&zippy=%2Cuser-consent).
  1. Select the appropriate application type for your project. Most likely, you will choose **Web application**.
  1. In the **Authorized Redirect URIs** setting, paste the **Redirect URI** value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Create**. Keep this page open.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  Once the OAuth client is created in the Google Cloud Console, a modal will open with your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save these values somewhere secure.

  Go back to the Clerk Dashboard, where the modal should still be open, and paste these values into the respective fields. Then, select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the **Google** connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.
