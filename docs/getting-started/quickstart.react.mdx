This tutorial will demonstrate how to create a new React app using Vite and add authentication to it using Clerk. If you would like to create an application using the React Router framework, see the [React Router quickstart](/docs/react-router/getting-started/quickstart).

<Steps>
  ## Create a new React app

  If you don't already have a React app, run the following commands to [create a new one using Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

  ```npm
  npm create vite@latest clerk-react -- --template react-ts
  cd clerk-react
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  ## Install `@clerk/clerk-react`

  The [Clerk React SDK](/docs/reference/react/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  ```npm
  npm install @clerk/clerk-react
  ```

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  <Include src="_partials/quickstarts/set-clerk-publishable-key" />

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  ```

  ## Import the Clerk Publishable Key

  In your `main.tsx` file, import your Clerk [Publishable Key](!publishable-key). You can add an `if` statement to check that it is imported and that it exists. This will prevent running the app without the Publishable Key, and will also prevent TypeScript errors.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [[6, 7], [9, 11]] }}
  import { StrictMode } from 'react'
  import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
  import './index.css'
  import App from './App.tsx'

  // Import your Publishable Key
  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
    throw new Error('Add your Clerk Publishable Key to the .env file')
  }

  createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <StrictMode>
      <App />
    </StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

  ## Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your app

  <Include src="_partials/clerk-provider/explanation" />

  Pass your [Publishable Key](!publishable-key) as a prop to the component, as shown in the following example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [5, 16, 18] }}
  import { StrictMode } from 'react'
  import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
  import './index.css'
  import App from './App.tsx'
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

  // Import your Publishable Key
  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
    throw new Error('Add your Clerk Publishable Key to the .env file')
  }

  createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <StrictMode>
      <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
        <App />
      </ClerkProvider>
    </StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

  ## Create a header with Clerk components

  You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with the [prebuilt control components](/docs/reference/components/overview#control-components). The following example creates a header using the following components:

  <Include src="_partials/quickstarts/create-header-components" />

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/App.tsx', mark: [2, [7, 17]] }}
  import './App.css'
  import { SignedIn, SignedOut, SignInButton, SignUpButton, UserButton } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

  function App() {
    return (
      <>
        <header>
          {/* Show the sign-in button when the user is signed out */}
          <SignedOut>
            <SignInButton />
            <SignUpButton />
          </SignedOut>
          {/* Show the user button when the user is signed in */}
          <SignedIn>
            <UserButton />
          </SignedIn>
        </header>
      </>
    )
  }

  export default App
  ```

  <Include src="_partials/quickstarts/run-project" />

  <Include src="_partials/quickstarts/create-first-user-react" />
</Steps>
