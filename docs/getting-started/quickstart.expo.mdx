<Steps>
  ## Enable Native API

  <Include src="_partials/native-api-callout" />

  ## Create an Expo app

  Run the following commands to create a new Expo app.

  ```npm
  npx create-expo-app@latest clerk-expo --template react-ts
  cd clerk-expo
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  ## Install `@clerk/clerk-expo`

  The [Clerk Expo SDK](/docs/reference/expo/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  ```npm
  npm install @clerk/clerk-expo
  ```

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add your Clerk Publishable Key to your `.env` file. It can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable Key.
    1. Paste your key into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  ```

  ## Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your root layout

  <Include src="_partials/clerk-provider/explanation" />

  Add the component to your root layout as shown in the following example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/_layout.tsx', mark: [1, 6, 8] }}
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'
  import { Slot } from 'expo-router'

  export default function RootLayout() {
    return (
      <ClerkProvider>
        <Slot />
      </ClerkProvider>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Configure the token cache

  Clerk stores the active user's session token in memory by default. In Expo apps, the recommended way to store sensitive data, such as tokens, is by using `expo-secure-store` which encrypts the data before storing it.

  To use `expo-secure-store` as your token cache:

  1. Run the following command to install the library:

     ```npm
     npm install expo-secure-store
     ```

  1. Update your root layout to use the secure token cache:
     ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/_layout.tsx', mark: [2, 7] }}
     import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'
     import { tokenCache } from '@clerk/clerk-expo/token-cache'
     import { Slot } from 'expo-router'

     export default function RootLayout() {
       return (
         <ClerkProvider tokenCache={tokenCache}>
           <Slot />
         </ClerkProvider>
       )
     }
     ```

  > [!TIP]
  > When you sign a user out with [`signOut()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-auth#returns), Clerk will remove the user's session JWT from the token cache.

  ## Add sign-up and sign-in pages

  Clerk currently only supports [control components](/docs/reference/components/overview#control-components) for Expo native. UI components are only available for Expo web. Instead, you must build [custom flows](!custom-flow) using Clerk's API. The following sections demonstrate how to build [custom email/password sign-up and sign-in flows](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-password). If you want to use different authentication methods, such as passwordless or OAuth, see the dedicated custom flow guides.

  ### Layout page

  First, protect your sign-up and sign-in pages.

  1. Create an `(auth)` [route group](https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/shared-routes/). This will group your sign-up and sign-in pages.
  1. In the `(auth)` group, create a `_layout.tsx` file with the following code. The [`useAuth()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-auth) hook is used to access the user's authentication state. If the user is already signed in, they will be redirected to the home page.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/(auth)/_layout.tsx' }}
  import { Redirect, Stack } from 'expo-router'
  import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'

  export default function AuthRoutesLayout() {
    const { isSignedIn } = useAuth()

    if (isSignedIn) {
      return <Redirect href={'/'} />
    }

    return <Stack />
  }
  ```

  ### Sign-up page

  In the `(auth)` group, create a `sign-up.tsx` file with the following code. The [`useSignUp()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-sign-up) hook is used to create a sign-up flow. The user can sign up using their email and password and will receive an email verification code to confirm their email.

  <Include src="_partials/custom-flows/email-password/sign-up-expo" />

  ### Sign-in page

  In the `(auth)` group, create a `sign-in.tsx` file with the following code. The [`useSignIn()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-sign-in) hook is used to create a sign-in flow. The user can sign in using email address and password, or navigate to the sign-up page.

  <Include src="_partials/custom-flows/email-password/sign-in-expo" />

  For more information about building these [custom flows](!custom-flow), including guided comments in the code examples, see the [Build a custom email/password authentication flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-password) guide.

  ## Add a sign-out button

  At this point, your users can sign up or in, but they need a way to sign out.

  In the `components/` folder, create a `SignOutButton.tsx` file with the following code. The [`useClerk()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-clerk) hook is used to access the `signOut()` function, which is called when the user clicks the "Sign out" button.

  <Include src="_partials/expo/sign-out-custom-flow" />

  ## Conditionally render content

  You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/reference/components/overview#control-components). For this quickstart, you'll use:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.

  To get started:

  1. Create a `(home)` route group.
  1. In the `(home)` group, create a `_layout.tsx` file with the following code.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/(home)/_layout.tsx' }}
  import { Stack } from 'expo-router/stack'

  export default function Layout() {
    return <Stack />
  }
  ```

  Then, in the same folder, create an `index.tsx` file with the following code. If the user is signed in, it displays their email and a sign-out button. If they're not signed in, it displays sign-in and sign-up links.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/(home)/index.tsx' }}
  import { SignedIn, SignedOut, useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'
  import { Link } from 'expo-router'
  import { Text, View } from 'react-native'
  import { SignOutButton } from '@/app/components/SignOutButton'

  export default function Page() {
    const { user } = useUser()

    return (
      <View>
        <SignedIn>
          <Text>Hello {user?.emailAddresses[0].emailAddress}</Text>
          <SignOutButton />
        </SignedIn>
        <SignedOut>
          <Link href="/(auth)/sign-in">
            <Text>Sign in</Text>
          </Link>
          <Link href="/(auth)/sign-up">
            <Text>Sign up</Text>
          </Link>
        </SignedOut>
      </View>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Create your first user

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun" ]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm start
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn start
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm start
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun start
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Now visit your app's homepage at [`http://localhost:8081`](http://localhost:8081). Sign up to create your first user.
</Steps>

## Enable OTA updates

Though not required, it is recommended to implement over-the-air (OTA) updates in your Expo app. This enables you to easily roll out Clerk's feature updates and security patches as they're released without having to resubmit your app to mobile marketplaces.

See the [`expo-updates`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/updates) library to learn how to get started.
