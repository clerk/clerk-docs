  - Use Coinbase Wallet to authenticate users with Web3
</TutorialHero>

Enabling [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) as a Web3 provider allows your users to sign in and sign up to your Clerk application with their Coinbase Wallet. Both [Smart Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet/smart-wallet) and the [Coinbase Wallet browser extension](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet/downloads) are supported.

> [!WARNING]
> This guide is for using Coinbase Wallet for authentication. If you are looking to connect users via [Coinbase.com](https://www.coinbase.com/), see [the guide for enabling Coinbase as an OAuth provider.](/docs/authentication/social-connections/coinbase)

## Enable Coinbase Wallet as a Web3 provider

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/web3).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **Web3**.
1. From the list of web3 providers, enable **Coinbase Wallet**.

## Test authentication

The simplest way to test authentication is to visit your Clerk application's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk applications out-of-the-box.

1. In the sidebar of the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal).
1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:
   - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
   - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
1. On the sign-in page, you should see **Coinbase Wallet** as an option. Use it to sign in with your Coinbase Wallet.

## Collect additional user information during sign-up

Web3 applications typically utilize a hexadecimal wallet address to identify users, which offers a high level of privacy. However, when bridging the gap between Web3 and Web2, it's often necessary to gather human-readable information about the user, such as their email address, phone number, or a username.

To collect additional information about your user during sign-up:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/web3).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **[Email, phone, username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username)**.
1. On this page, toggle on attributes you wish to collect from your user during sign up. Select the settings cog icon next to an attribute to set it as **Required**. When set as **Required**, Clerk automatically prompts the user for this information after they authenticate with Coinbase Wallet.

## Connect Coinbase Wallet to existing account

Users can connect their Coinbase Wallet to their account at any time through their user profile page. You can configure your application to use the [Account Portal User Profile page](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview#user-profile) or the prebuilt [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/components/user/user-profile) component.
