## How this tool works

The JWT Decoder lets you decode and verify JWTs. Currently only the RS256 algorithm is supported. Paste a JWT or select a Clerk session cookie to decode and verify the token. Click 'Create Example' to generate a random key set and JWT. You can add data to the payload and click 'Resign' to generate a new JWT from the payload.

> [!WARNING]
> The JWTs generated by this tool are for demonstration and educational purposes only. Do not use them for authentication, authorization, or any production use. Keys are generated client-side in your browser. This tool is intended for learning and debugging JWT structure, not for creating valid, production-ready tokens. All verification and decoding occurs in your browser and is not sent to the server.

<ClerkJWTDecoder>
  Visit your frontend that is using Clerk and sign in. Once you have signed in, open the browser [Dev Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) and go to the **Console** tab. Enter the following command:

  ```js
  await window.Clerk.session.getToken()
  ```

  Copy the console output and paste it into the JWT input to decode the token.

  Alternatively, you can use the [`getToken()`](/docs/reference/javascript/session#get-token) method from a Clerk SDK.
