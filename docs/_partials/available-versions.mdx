- Notification for new sign-ins to users' accounts feature becomes available.
- The response for sign-ins with an email address that matches a **SAML connection** is updated:
  - Instead of responding with a status of `needs_identifier`, the API now returns a status of `needs_first_factor`.
  - The email address that matched will be returned in the identifier field.
  - The only strategy that will be included in supported first factors is `enterprise_sso`.

### 2021-02-05

The initial API version was released on 2021-02-05 as part of the first Clerk release. It predates the versioning system. All changes made to it since then are backwards compatible.
