Each task is identified by a unique [`SessionTask['key']`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/session-task). You can use these task keys to conditionally handle different requirements in your application logic.

The following table lists the available tasks and their corresponding keys.

| Setting | Key | Description |
| - | - | - |
| [Allow Personal Accounts](/docs/guides/organizations/configure#personal-accounts) | `choose-organization` | Disabled by default when enabling Organizations [for instances created after August 22, 2025](!update). When disabled, users are required to choose an Organization after authenticating. When enabled, users can choose a [Personal Account](!personal-account) instead of an Organization. |
| [Force password reset](/docs/guides/secure/password-protection-and-rules#manually-set-a-password-as-compromised) | `reset-password` | Enabled by default [for instances created after December 8, 2025](!update). When enabled, the user is required to reset their password on their next sign-in if their password is marked as compromised. |
| [Multi-factor authentication requirement](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options#multi-factor-authentication) | `setup-mfa` | When enabled, users are required to set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) after authenticating. Users can choose between authenticator app (TOTP) or SMS verification depending on which methods are enabled in the instance settings. |
