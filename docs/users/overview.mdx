description: Learn how to manage your users in your Clerk application.
---

You can manage your users [in the Clerk Dashboard](#manage-users-in-the-clerk-dashboard), or [in your app](#manage-users-in-your-app).

## Manage users in the Clerk Dashboard

To manage users in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Users**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=users) page.

## Manage users in your app

You can manage users in your app either through the frontend or backend. But first, it's important to understand the [`User` object](/docs/references/javascript/user).

<Include src="_partials/user-object" />

For more information on the `User` object, such as helper methods for retrieving and updating user information and authentication status, see the [reference docs](/docs/references/javascript/user). The `User` object is also available in the backend, but it looks slightly different. For more information, see the [Backend `User` object reference docs](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-user).

### Manage users in the frontend

Depending on the level of abstraction you need, you can manage users in the frontend using Clerk's prebuilt components, React hooks, or lower-level JavaScript methods.

- Prebuilt components: Clerk provides the prebuilt components [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button) and [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/components/user/user-profile) to help your users manage their profile data.
- Hooks: Because Clerk's React-based SDKs are built on top of the Clerk React SDK, you can use the [hooks](/docs/references/react/overview#custom-hooks) that the React SDK provides. These hooks include access to the `User` object and helpful methods for managing user authentication and profile data.
- JavaScript methods: If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

### Manage users in the backend

The [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) exposes the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} resources and low-level authentication utilities for JavaScript environments.

There are many operations available for managing users, such as `getUser()`, `createUser()`, and `deleteUser()`. For more information, see the [Backend SDK reference docs](/docs/references/backend/overview).
