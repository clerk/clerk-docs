Clerk offers a flexible, layered approach to UI customization. Whether you just want to adjust colors and variables or build a fully custom experience using Clerk's headless APIs, you can choose the level of control that fits your needs.

This guide will help you select the right customization layer for your application.

## Customization layers

### The `appearance` prop

The `appearance` prop controls customization of Clerk's prebuilt components. The value of the `appearance` prop is also the basis of a [Clerk theme](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/themes).

#### Variables

[Variables](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/variables) let you customize colors and core design tokens within Clerk's prebuilt components. Choose this option if you like the default UI but only need to make small visual changes.

### Themes

Clerk provides several [prebuilt themes](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/themes), including a `shadcn` theme to make Clerk's prebuilt components match your `shadcn` styling. Themes are defined using the [`appearance` prop](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/overview) and can be bundled into a standalone theme and shared with others. Use themes if you want consistent styling across teams or applications, or if one of Clerk's prebuilt themes already aligns with your brand.

### Bring your own CSS

Clerk assigns stable CSS classes to most elements, allowing you to style them from your own stylesheet, or by using `appearance.elements` to apply additional classes and styles. For full control over the look of Clerk's prebuilt components, use the built-in `simple` theme together with your own custom CSS. For more details, see the [Bring your own CSS](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/bring-your-own-css) guide.

### Headless APIs

Clerk offers the same headless APIs used to create our prebuilt components, which allow you build a fully custom user interface whenever you need to. It's recommended to use the prebuilt components when possible to benefit from ongoing updates and lower maintenance, but the Clerk's APIs and guides are available if you need [complete control over the UI](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview).
