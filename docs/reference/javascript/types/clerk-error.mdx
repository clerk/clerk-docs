Type used for all errors generated by the Clerk SDK. Additional error types such as [`ClerkAPIResponseError`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/clerk-api-response-error) and `ClerkRuntimeError` are instances of `ClerkError`.

<Properties>
  - `message`
  - `string`

  A message that describes the error. This is typically intented to be showed to the developers. It should not be shown to the user or parsed directly as the message contents are not guaranteed to be stable - use the `code` property instead.

  ---

  - `code`
  - `string`

  A machine-stable code that identifies the error.

  ---

  - `longMessage?`
  - `string`

  A user-friendly message that describes the error and can be displayed to the user. This message defaults to English but can be usually translated to the user's language by matching the `code` property to a localized message.

  ---

  - `cause?`
  - `Error`

  The cause of the error, typically an `Error` instance that was caught and wrapped by the Clerk error handler.

  ---

  - `docsUrl?`
  - `string`

  A URL to the documentation for the error.
