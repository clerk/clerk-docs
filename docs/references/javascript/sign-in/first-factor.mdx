These are all methods on the [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) class that allow you to handle the first factor of a multi-factor authentication flow.

## `prepareFirstFactor()`

Begins the first factor verification process. This is a required step in order to complete a sign in, as users should be verified at least by one factor of authentication.

Common scenarios are one-time code (OTP) or social account (SSO) verification. This is determined by the accepted `strategy` parameter values. Each authentication identifier supports different strategies.

Returns a [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object. Check the `firstFactorVerification` attribute for the status of the first factor verification process.

```typescript
function prepareFirstFactor(params: PrepareFirstFactorParams): Promise<SignIn>
```

### `PrepareFirstFactorParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'email_link' | 'email_code' | 'phone_code' | 'web3_metamask_signature' | 'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature' | 'web3_okx_wallet_signature' | 'passkey' | 'oauth_<provider>' | 'saml' | 'enterprise_sso' | 'reset_password_phone_code' | 'reset_password_email_code'`

  The `strategy` value depends on the `SignIn.identifier` value. Each authentication identifier supports different verification strategies. The following strategies are supported:

  - `'email_link'`: User will receive an email magic link via email.
  - `'email_code'`: User will receive a one-time authentication code via email. Requires `emailAddressId` parameter to be set.
  - `'phone_code'`: User will receive a one-time authentication code via SMS. Requires `phoneNumberId` parameter to be set.
  - `'web3_metamask_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). Requires `web3WalletId` parameter to be set.
  - `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet). Requires `web3WalletId` parameter to be set.
  - `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [OKX Wallet](https://www.okx.com/help/section/faq-web3-wallet). Requires `web3WalletId` parameter to be set.
  - `'passkey'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's passkey.
  - `'oauth_<provider>'`: The user will be authenticated with their [social connection account](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview). [See a list of supported values for `<provider>`](/docs/references/javascript/types/sso#o-auth-provider).
  - `'saml'` (deprecated): **Deprecated in favor of `'enterprise_sso'`.** The user will be authenticated with their [SAML account](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/overview#saml).
  - `'enterprise_sso'`: The user will be authenticated either through SAML or OIDC depending on the configuration of their [enterprise SSO account](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/overview).
  - `'reset_password_phone_code'`: Used when the user is trying to reset their password. The user will receive a one-time code via SMS. Requires `phoneNumberId` parameter to be set.
  - `'reset_password_email_code'`: Used when the user is trying to reset their password. The user will receive a one-time code via email. Requires `emailAddressId` parameter to be set.

  ---

  - `emailAddressId?`
  - `string`

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'email_code'` or `'reset_password_email_code'`. The ID for the user's email address that will receive an email with the one-time authentication code.

  ---

  - `phoneNumberId?`
  - `string`

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'phone_code'` or `'reset_password_phone_code'`. The ID for the user's phone number that will receive an SMS message with the one-time authentication code.

  ---

  - `web3WalletId?`
  - `string`

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'web3_metamask_signature'`, `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'`, or `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`. The ID for the user's Web3 wallet address.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The full URL or path that the OAuth provider should redirect to after successful authorization on their part. Typically, this will be a simple `/sso-callback` route that either calls [`Clerk.handleRedirectCallback`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/handle-navigation#handle-redirect-callback) or mounts the [`<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />`](/docs/components/control/authenticate-with-callback) component. See the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/oauth-connections) for implementation details.

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'email_link'`. The full URL that the user will be redirected to when they visit the email link. See the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/email-links) for implementation details.

  ---

  - `actionCompleteRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The URL that the user will be redirected to once the first factor verification is complete.
</Properties>

## `attemptFirstFactor()`

Attempts to complete the first factor verification process. This is a required step in order to complete a sign in, as users should be verified at least by one factor of authentication.

Make sure that a [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object already exists before you call this method, either by first calling `SignIn.create` or `SignIn.prepareFirstFactor`. The only strategy that does not require a verification to have already been prepared before attempting to complete it, is the `password` strategy.

Depending on the strategy that was selected when the verification was prepared, the method parameters should be different.

Returns a [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object. Check the `firstFactorVerification` attribute for the status of the first factor verification process.

```typescript
function attemptFirstFactor(params: AttemptFirstFactorParams): Promise<SignIn>
```

### `AttemptFirstFactorParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'email_code' | 'phone_code' | 'password' | 'web3_metamask_signature' | 'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature' | 'web3_okx_wallet_signature' | 'passkey' | 'reset_password_phone_code' | 'reset_password_email_code'`

  The `strategy` value depends on the `SignIn.identifier` value. Each authentication identifier supports different verification strategies. The following strategies are supported:

  - `'email_code'`: User will receive a one-time authentication code via email. At least one email address should be on file for the user.
  - `'phone_code'`: User will receive a one-time code via SMS. At least one phone number should be on file for the user.
  - `'password'`: The verification will attempt to be completed with the user's password.
  - `'web3_metamask_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).
  - `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet).
  - `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's Web3 wallet address via [OKX Wallet](https://www.okx.com/help/section/faq-web3-wallet).
  - `'passkey'`: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's passkey.
  - `'reset_password_phone_code'`: Used when the user is trying to reset their password. The user will receive a one-time code via SMS.
  - `'reset_password_email_code'`: Used when the user is trying to reset their password. The user will receive a one-time code via email.
