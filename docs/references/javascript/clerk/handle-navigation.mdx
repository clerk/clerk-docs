# Handle navigation

These are all methods on [the Clerk class](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) that help you handle navigation callbacks from Clerk, usually in conjunction with [redirect methods](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/redirect-methods) or [built URLs](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/build-urls).

## `handleEmailLinkVerification()`

Completes an email link verification flow once we've reached the email link results URL.

```typescript
function handleEmailLinkVerification(
    params: handleEmailLinkVerificationParams,
    customNavigate?: ((to: string) => Promise<unknown>) | undefined
): Promise<unknown>;
```

When users click on email links they get redirected to the URL that was provided during email link verification flow initialization. The URL will contain a couple of important query parameters added by Clerk. These are called `__clerk_status` and `__clerk_created_session`.

The `__clerk_status` query parameter is the outcome of the verification and can take three values: **verified**, **failed** or **expired**.

The `__clerk_created_session` query parameter will hold the ID of the new session, if one was created as a result of the verification. Since the email link can be opened at any device and not the one that originated the verification, the new session ID might not be available under [Client.sessions](/docs/references/javascript/client#properties).

Email link flows can be completed on the same device that they were initiated or on a completely different browser. For example, a user might start the email link flow on their desktop browser, but click on the email link from their mobile phone.

The `handleEmailLinkVerification()` method takes care of finalizing the email link flow, depending on the verification outcome.

Upon successful verification, the method will figure out if the sign in or sign up attempt was completed and redirect the user accordingly. As such, it accepts different parameters for the URL it should redirect when sign-in or sign-up is completed and the URL which it should redirect when the sign-in or sign-up attempt is still pending. Both parameters are optional, but you can provide them to the method up front. The final redirect will depend on the sign-in or sign-up attempt's status.

If the email link verification failed or the link expired, this method will throw a [`EmailLinkError`](/docs/custom-flows/email-links). Check the error's `code` property for details.

Additionally, the `handleEmailLinkVerification()` method allows you to execute a callback if the successful verification happened on another device.

In case the email link verification wasn't successful, the `handleEmailLinkVerification()` method will throw a [`EmailLinkError`](/docs/custom-flows/email-links). You can check the error's `code` property to see if the email link expired, or the verification simply failed.

Take a look at the function parameters description below for more usage details.

## `handleUnauthenticated()`

Handles a 401 response from [Frontend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/frontend-api) by refreshing the client and session object accordingly.

```typescript
function handleUnauthenticated(opts?: { broadcast: boolean }): Promise<unknown>;
```
