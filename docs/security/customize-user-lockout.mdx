Clerk provides an account lockout feature in order to protect user credentials against brute force attacks. By default, this feature is enabled. To configure this feature, in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Attack protection**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/attack-protection) page. Here, you can enable or disable **Account lockout**, or configure the following settings:

- The **Maximum attempt limit** setting controls the number of failed sign-in attempts before a user is locked out. To change this setting, enter a new number of failed attempts allowed. (The default is 100 attempts.)
- **Lockout duration** controls the amount of time a user is locked out from their account after reaching the **Maximum attempt limit**.
  - The **Time limit** setting allows you to set an amount of time until the user account is unlocked. To change this setting, select the unit of time (minutes/hours/days/years) and enter the number of units you want lockouts to last.
  - The **Indefinite Lockout** setting locks a user account until it's manually unlocked in the Clerk Dashboard.
