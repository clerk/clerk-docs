Organizations let you group users with roles and permissions, enabling you to build multi-tenant B2B apps like Slack (workspaces), Linear (teams), or Vercel (projects) where users can switch between different team contexts.

<Steps>
  ## Enable organizations in the Clerk Dashboard

  Organizations are disabled by default. To enable them:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Organizations Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings) page.
  1. Select **Enable Organizations**.
  1. In the modal, choose whether to allow personal accounts:
     - **Personal accounts disabled (default)**: Every user must belong to an organization. This is recommended for most B2B applications.
     - **Personal accounts enabled**: Users can operate in their own individual workspace or join organizations.
  1. Select **Enable**.

  Learn more about configuring organizations in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/organizations/configure).

  ## Add the OrganizationSwitcher component

  The [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher) component is the easiest way to let users create, switch between, and manage organizations. Add it to your app's header or navigation:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'components/Header.tsx' }}
  import { OrganizationSwitcher } from '@clerk/nextjs'

  export default function Header() {
    return (
      <header>
        <OrganizationSwitcher />
      </header>
    )
  }
  ```

  The `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component handles all organization flows including:
  - Creating new organizations
  - Switching between organizations
  - Managing the active organization's profile
  - Viewing organization members and invitations

  ## Access organization data

  Use Clerk's hooks to access the current organization and role in your components:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx', mark: [3, [6, 9], 14, 17]}}
  'use client'
  
  import { useOrganization, useOrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs'

  export default function Home() {
    const { organization } = useOrganization()
    const { userMemberships } = useOrganizationList({
      userMemberships: true,
    })
    
    return (
      <div className="p-8">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
          Welcome to the <strong>{organization?.name}</strong> organization
        </h1>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Your role in this organization: <strong>{userMemberships?.data?.find((membership) => membership.organization.id === organization?.id)?.role}</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Visit your app

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit your app locally at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

  ## Create and switch organization

  Use `<OrganizationSwitcher />` to create, switch between, and manage organizations.

  1. Click on the `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component, then **Create an organization**.

  1. Enter `Acme Org` as the organization name.
  
  1. Invite users to your organization and select their role.

  ## Protect routes by organization and roles

  You can protect routes based on organization membership, roles, and permissions. The `/protected` page checks if you are an admin in the `Acme Corp` organization:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/protected/page.tsx', mark: [1, 6, 13, 14, 17, 18]}}
  import { auth, clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  export default async function Page() {
    // Protect the route by checking for a specific role
    // This will throw a 404 if the user is not authenticated or doesn't have the role
    const { orgId } = await auth.protect({ role: 'org:admin' })

    if (!orgId) {
      return <p className="text-red-600">You must be signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> to access this page.</p>
    }

    // Fetch the organization to check its name
    const client = await clerkClient()
    const organization = await client.organizations.getOrganization({ organizationId: orgId })

    // Check if organization name matches (e.g., "Acme Corp")
    const requiredOrgName = 'Acme Corp'
    if (organization.name !== requiredOrgName) {
      return <p className="text-red-600">You are currently not signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> in the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> organization.</p>
    }
    
    return <p className="text-green-600">You are currently signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> in the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> organization.</p>
  }
  ```

  Learn more about protecting routes and checking organization roles in the [authorization guide](/docs/guides/organizations/roles-and-permissions).

  ## It's time to build your B2B SaaS!

  You've added Clerk organizations to your Next.js app 🎉. Ready to scale to enterprise customers? 
  
  - **Control access** with [custom roles and permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/roles-and-permissions) define granular permissions for different user types within organizations.
  
  - **Onboard entire companies** with [verified domains](/docs/guides/organizations/verified-domains) automatically invite users with approved email domains (e.g., `@company.com`) to join organizations without manual invitations.
  
  - **Enable enterprise SSO** with [SAML and OIDC](/docs/guides/organizations/sso) let customers authenticate through their identity provider (Okta, Entra ID, Google Workspace) with unlimited connections, no per-connection fees.
