title: <code>\<AuthenticateWith<wbr />RedirectCallbackÂ /></code>
description: Clerk's `<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />` component is used to implement custom OAuth flows. It handles the OAuth callback and completes the authentication process.
---

The `<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />` component is a crucial part of implementing custom OAuth flows in your application. It serves as the callback handler for the authentication process initiated by the `authenticateWithRedirect()` method. Render it on the route specified as the `redirectUrl` in your `authenticateWithRedirect()` call.

This component automatically handles the OAuth callback, completing the authentication process and managing the user's session. It uses the [`handleRedirectCallback()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk#handle-redirect-callback) method under the hood.
