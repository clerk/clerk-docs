The `useSignUp()` composable provides access to the [`SignUp`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-up) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-up attempt and manage the sign-up flow. You can use this to create a [custom sign-up flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview#sign-up-flow).

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `isLoaded`
  - `Ref<boolean>`

  A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads.

  ---

  - `setActive()`
  - <code>Ref\<(params: [SetActiveParams](/docs/reference/javascript/types/set-active-params)) => Promise\<void>></code>

  A function that sets the active session.

  ---

  - `signUp`
  - <code>Ref\<[SignUp](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-up)></code>

  An object that contains the current sign-up attempt status and methods to create a new sign-up attempt.
</Properties>

## How to use the `useSignUp()` composable

### Check the current state of a sign-up

The following example uses the `useSignUp()` hook to access the [`SignUp`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-up) object, which contains the current sign-up attempt status and methods to create a new sign-up attempt. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state.

```vue {{ filename: 'SignUpStep.vue' }}
<script setup>
import { useSignUp } from '@clerk/vue'

const { isLoaded, signUp } = useSignUp()
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">
    <!-- Handle loading state -->
  </div>

  <div v-else>The current sign-up attempt status is {{ signUp?.status }}.</div>
</template>
```
