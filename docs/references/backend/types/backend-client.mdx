title: 'The Backend `Client` object'
description: The Backend Client object holds information about the authenticated sessions in the current device. However, the Backend Client object is different from the Client object in that it is used in the Backend API.
---

The Backend `Client` object is similar to the [`Client`](/docs/references/javascript/client) object as it holds information about the authenticated sessions in the current device. However, the Backend `Client` object is different from the `Client` object in that it is used in the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Clients#operation/GetClient) and is not directly accessible from the Frontend API.
