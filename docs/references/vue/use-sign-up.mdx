title: useSignUp()
description: Access and manage sign-up state in your Vue application with Clerk's useSignUp() composable.
---

The `useSignUp()` composable provides access to the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-up attempt and manage the sign-up flow. You can use this to create a [custom sign-up flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview#sign-up-flow).

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `isLoaded`
  - `Ref<boolean>`

  A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads.

  ---

  - `setActive()`
  - <code>Ref\<(params: [SetActiveParams](#set-active-params)) => Promise\<void>></code>

  A function that sets the active session.

  ---

  - `signUp`
  - <code>Ref\<[SignUp](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up)></code>

  An object that contains the current sign-up attempt status and methods to create a new sign-up attempt.
</Properties>

### `SetActiveParams`

<Properties>
  - `session`
  - <code>[Session](/docs/references/javascript/session) | string | null</code>

  The session resource or session ID (string version) to be set as active. If `null`, the current session is deleted.

  ---

  - `organization`
  - <code>[Organization](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) | string | null</code>

  The organization resource or organization ID/slug (string version) to be set as active in the current session. If `null`, the currently active organization is removed as active.

  ---

  - `beforeEmit?`
  - `(session?: Session | null) => void | Promise<any>`

  Callback run just before the active session and/or organization is set to the passed object. Can be used to composable up for pre-navigation actions.
</Properties>

## How to use the `useSignUp()` composable

### Check the current state of a sign-up

Use `useSignUp()` to access the `SignUp` object and check the current state of a sign-up.

```vue {{ filename: 'SignUpStep.vue' }}
<script setup>
import { useSignUp } from '@clerk/vue'

const { isLoaded, signUp } = useSignUp()
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">
    <!-- Handle loading state -->
  </div>

  <div v-else>The current sign-up attempt status is {{ signUp.status }}.</div>
</template>
```

The `status` property of the `SignUp` object can be one of the following values:

<Properties>
  - `complete`
  - `string`

  The user has been created and the custom flow can proceed to `setActive()` to create session.

  ---

  - `abandoned`
  - `string`

  The sign-up attempt will be abandoned if it was started more than 24 hours previously.

  ---

  - `missing_requirements`
  - `string`

  A requirement is missing from the [Email, Phone, Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) settings. For example, in the Clerk Dashboard, the **Password** setting is required but a password wasn't provided in the custom flow.
</Properties>
