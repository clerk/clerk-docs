This guide show's you how to authenticate with passkeys in your Expo application.

> [!WARNING]
> This API is available only for [@clerk/clerk-expo v2](/docs/upgrade-guides/expo-v2/upgrade) >=2.2.0.

<Steps>
  ### Enable passkeys

  To use passkeys, you must first enable the strategy. If you haven't already visit the [Enable passkeys documentation section](https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/passkeys#enable-passkeys)

  ### Set your associated domains and your digital asset links files.

  Before using passkeys in Expo, you must configure `assetlinks.json` for `Android` and `associated domains` for `iOS`.

  Clerk makes this setup easy through the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=native-applications).

  Follow the following guide on how to do that on `iOS` and `Android`:

  <Tabs items={['iOS', 'Android']}>
    <Tab>
      <Steps>
        > [!WARNING]
        > Ios Support passkeys from version iOS 16+

        ### Under the IOS tab you will be able to see the following form:

        ![Where to find FRONTEND API URL OF YOUR CLERK APP.](/docs/images/expo/passkeys/ios_form.png)

        In the above form you need to provide the:

        - The `Bundle ID` of your app
        - Your `App ID Prefix`.

        `Bundle ID` and `App ID Prefix` can be found at `Apple's developer portal` under [Certificates,Identifiers & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)

        ### Copy your  `<YOUR_FRONTEND_API>`

        ![Where to find FRONTEND API URL OF YOUR CLERK APP.](/docs/images/expo/passkeys/ios_after_setup.png)

        ### Update `app.json` in your Expo application.

        At your app's `app.json` you will need add the `associatedDomains` under the `ios` object.
        Use the `<YOUR_FRONTEND_API>` that you copy on the previous step.

        ```json
        {
          "expo": {
            //...existing properties
            "plugins": [
              [
                "expo-build-properties",
                {
                  "ios": {
                    "deploymentTarget": "16.0" //  Ios Support passkeys from version iOS 16+
                  }
                }
              ]
            ],
            "ios": {
              //...existing properties
              "associatedDomains": ["applinks:<YOUR_FRONTEND_API>", "webcredentials:<YOUR_FRONTEND_API>"]
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      </Steps>
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      > [!WARNING]
      > Android supports passkeys from version Android 9+

      To create your digital asset links file, in the form that appears you will need to provide the `namespace `, `package name` and `sha256_cert_fingerprints` of your android app.

      - For namespace use the value of `android_app`.
      - For package name use the package name of your app.
      - Learn more about the `sha256_cert_fingerprints` and how to generate in the following links:
        - [Android app linking in official Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/linking/android-app-links/#create-assetlinksjson-file)
        - [Verify app linking in official Android docs](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks#web-assoc)

      > [!NOTE]
      > You can check that your `assetlinks.json` can be associated with your app by using [Statement List Generator and Tester](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/tools/generator)

      After successfully submitting the above values the `assetlinks.json` will be hosted at: `https://<YOUR_FRONTEND_API>/.well-known/assetlinks.json.`

      You can copy your `<YOUR_FRONTEND_API>` from here:
      ![Where to find FRONTEND API URL OF YOUR CLERK APP.](/docs/images/expo/passkeys/android_after_setup.png)

      Now that we set up the `assetlinks.json` we need to update the `app.json` file in our Expo application.

      ```json
      {
        "expo": {
          "android": {
            //...existing properties
            "intentFilters": [
              {
                "action": "VIEW",
                "autoVerify": true,
                "data": [
                  {
                    "scheme": "https",
                    "host": "<YOUR_FRONTEND_API>"
                  }
                ],
                "category": ["BROWSABLE", "DEFAULT"]
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ### Install the necessary peer dependencies

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/expo-passkeys
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/expo-passkeys
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/expo-passkeys
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Add passkeys object your `<ClerkProvider>`

  ```tsx
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'
  import { passkeys } from '@clerk/clerk-expo/passkeys'

  return <ClerkProvider __experimental__passkeys={passkeys}>{/* Your app here */}</ClerkProvider>
  ```

  ### Create a passkey

  ```tsx
  const { user } = useUser()

  const handleCreatePasskey = async () => {
    if (!user) return
    try {
      return await user.createPasskey()
    } catch (e: any) {
      // handle error
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Authenticate a user with a passkey

  ```tsx
  const { signIn, setActive } = useSignIn()

  const handlePasskeySignIn = async () => {
    try {
      const signInResponse = await signIn.authenticateWithPasskey({ flow: 'discoverable' })
      await setActive({ session: signInResponse.createdSessionId })
    } catch (err: any) {
      // handle error
    }
  }
  ```
</Steps>
