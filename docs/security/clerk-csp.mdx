title: Configure Clerk Content-Security-Policy headers
description: Learn how to configure your Content Security Policy to work with Clerk's APIs.

[Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) (CSP) headers secure your document by preventing resources from being loaded from unexpected sources. This protects your apps from [XSS](/docs/security/xss-leak-protection#xss-leak-protection) attacks and data injections.

For Clerk to work correctly in your application, you'll need to configure the following CSP directives:

1. `script-src` - This value should include the host application's FAPI hostname, such as `https://clerk.your-domain.com`, as well as cloudflare's bot protection host, `https://challenges.cloudflare.com`.
1. `connect-src` - This value should also include the host application's FAPI hostname, such as `https://clerk.your-domain.com`.
1. `img-src` - This value should be `https://img.clerk.com`.
1. `worker-src` - Use the `'self'` value to indicate that workers can be loaded from first-party scripts. The `blob:` schema value also needs to be included.
1. `style-src` - Due to Clerk's usage of runtime CSS-in-JS for styling, `'unsafe-inline'` needs to be included.
1. `frame-src` - This value should also include cloudflare's bot protection host, `https://challenges.cloudflare.com`.

The following example demonstrates a Next.js config file that sets the necessary directives for your application's assets and Clerk to load and function correctly. The values used apply to your currently selected instance, make sure to handle both your development instance and production instance hosts.

> [!WARNING]
> You will need to make sure any third-party domains where scripts or assets are loaded from are also specified.

```js {{ filename: 'next.config.js' }}
const cspHeader = `
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://{{fapi_url}} https://challenges.cloudflare.com;
  connect-src 'self' https://{{fapi_url}};
  img-src 'self' https://img.clerk.com;
  worker-src 'self' blob:;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  frame-src 'self' https://challenges.cloudflare.com;
  form-action 'self';
`

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/(.*)',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
            value: cspHeader.replace(/\n/g, ''),
          },
        ],
      },
    ]
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

## Usage of `unsafe-eval` and `unsafe-inline` directives in Next.js

- Within `script-src`, `unsafe-eval` is a [requirement for Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy#without-nonces) to run in development mode. _For production environment CSPs, it should be removed_.
- Within `script-src`, `unsafe-inline` is a requirement for Next.js in both dev and prod environments if you're using the App Router and not using `strict-dynamic`. If you are using the Pages Router, it can be removed.
- Within `style-src`, `unsafe-inline` is a requirement for Clerk's components to inject their styles. Removing this requirement is on our roadmap - please [reach out to support](/support){{ target: '_blank' }} if you'd like to see this implemented sooner.

## Implementing a `strict-dynamic` CSP

If you'd like to implement a [strict-dynamic CSP](https://content-security-policy.com/strict-dynamic/), Clerk supports this, but with a different type of configuration. As strict-dynamic CSPs require a "nonce" value that should be programmatically generated per-request, the best way to make this work is within middleware that runs on every request. The following example demonstrates how to implement a strict-dynamic CSP with Next.js middleware, but the same approach could be used with any other framework.

```ts {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default clerkMiddleware((auth, request) => {
  return applyCsp(request)
})

function applyCsp(request) {
  // create a randomly generated nonce value
  const nonce = Buffer.from(crypto.randomUUID()).toString('base64')

  // format the CSP header
  const cspHeader = `
    default-src 'self';
    script-src 'self' 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-${nonce}' https: http: ${
      process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '' : `'unsafe-eval'`
    };
    connect-src 'self' https://{{fapi_url}};
    img-src 'self' https://img.clerk.com;
    worker-src 'self' blob:;
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
    frame-src 'self' https://challenges.cloudflare.com;
    form-action 'self';
  `
  // Replace newline characters and spaces
  const contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue = cspHeader.replace(/\s{2,}/g, ' ').trim()

  // set the nonce and csp values in the request headers
  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)
  requestHeaders.set('x-nonce', nonce)
  requestHeaders.set('Content-Security-Policy', contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue)

  const response = NextResponse.next({
    request: {
      headers: requestHeaders,
    },
  })

  response.headers.set('Content-Security-Policy', contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue)

  return response
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

With this `strict-dynamic` configuration in place, **all script tags must be passed with a `nonce` value** or they will be blocked. This can be done by passing the nonce value as a `nonce` parameter to the script tag. For example, `<script src="https://example.com/script.js" nonce="<nonce_value>"></script>`. If you are using Next.js, any scripts loaded through next will automatically have the nonce value injected.

With the above middleware, the nonce value is made accessible via the `x-nonce` request header. An example is provided below on how to access this value within a Next.js page.

```tsx {{ filename: 'pages/index.tsx' }}
import { headers } from 'next/headers'

export default function Page() {
  const nonce = headers().get('x-nonce')

  return <p>{nonce}</p>
}
```

If you're using one of Clerk's React-based SDKs, in order for Clerk to load correctly, the nonce value must also be passed to Clerk's `<ClerkProvider>` component. This can be done by passing the nonce value as a `nonce` prop to the `<ClerkProvider>` component. For example:

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx' }}
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
import { headers } from 'next/headers'

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    // Note: since this is server-rendered, you don't _need_ to pass the nonce, see note below
    <ClerkProvider nonce={headers().get('x-nonce')}>
      <html lang="en">
        <body>{children}</body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}
```

If you are using Next.js and your layout file is rendered on the server (as is the case with the example above), Clerk's SDK will automatically read the `nonce` from the request and pass it into `<ClerkProvider>`. If you are rendering the provider on the client, you will need to explicitly pass the `nonce` value to the client and into `<ClerkProvider>`.
