## How the Account Portal works

The Account Portal uses our Clerk components embedded on dedicated pages hosted for your application and users are automatically redirect to and from your application for a seamless authentication experience.

This is available out of box for all instances and you do not need to set up any dedicated paths or pages.

## Getting Started  

To use the Account Portal in your application, you simply need to: 

- Install and add Clerk to your application
- Protect your Pages

You can follow along and get set up simply by following the quickstart guide for your framework of choice:
