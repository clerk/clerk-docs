Through Astro [`locals`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/#storing-data-in-contextlocals), Clerk's [`Auth`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object) and current [`User`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-user){{ target: '_blank' }} objects can be accessed between middlewares and pages. These locals are injected when you configure the provided [middleware](/docs/references/astro/clerk-middleware).

## `locals.auth()`

`Astro.locals.auth()` returns an `Auth` object. This JavaScript object contains important information like session data, your user's ID, as well as their active organization ID. Learn more about the `Auth` object [here](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }}.

### `locals.auth()` options

<Properties>
  - `opts?`
  - `{acceptsToken: TokenType, treatPendingAsSignedOut: boolean }`

  An optional object that can be used to configure the behavior of the `locals.auth()` function. It accepts the following properties:

  <Include src="_partials/machine-auth/accepts-token-explanation" />

  - `treatPendingAsSignedOut?`: A boolean that indicates whether to treat [`pending` session status](/docs/references/javascript/types/session-status#properties) as signed out. Defaults to `true`.
</Properties>

### Example: Protect a page or form

You can use the `auth()` local to protect your pages and forms. It will return the current user's ID if they are signed in, or `null` if they are not.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["Protect a page", "Protect a form"]}>
  ```astro {{ filename: 'src/pages/protected.astro' }}
  ---
  const { userId, redirectToSignIn } = Astro.locals.auth()

  if (!userId) {
    return redirectToSignIn()
  }
  ---

  <div>Protected page</div>
  ```

  ```astro {{ filename: 'src/pages/form.astro' }}
  ---
  if (Astro.request.method === 'POST') {
    if (!Astro.locals.auth().userId) {
      throw new Error('You must be signed in to add an item to your cart')
    }

    const data = await Astro.request.formData()
    console.log('add item action', data)
  }
  ---

  <form method="POST">
    <input value="test" type="text" name="name" />
    <button type="submit">Add to Cart</button>
  </form>
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Example: Protect a route based on token type

The following example uses `locals.auth()` to protect the route based on token type:

- It accepts any token type `(acceptsToken: 'any')` from the request.
- If the token is a `session_token`, it logs that the request is from a user session.
- Otherwise, it logs that the request uses a machine token and specifies its type.

```ts
export const GET: APIRoute = ({ locals }) => {
  // Use `locals.auth()` to protect a route based on token type
  const authObject = locals.auth({ acceptsToken: 'any' })

  if (authObject.tokenType === 'session_token') {
    console.log('This is a session token from a user')
  } else {
    console.log(`This is a ${authObject.tokenType} token`)
  }

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({}))
}
```

## `locals.currentUser()`

Current user data is important for data enrichment. The `currentUser()` local fetch the current user's [Backend `User`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-user){{ target: '_blank' }} object, which includes all of the user's information and provides a set of methods to manage their account.

Under the hood, this local:

- uses the `GET /v1/users/me` endpoint.
- counts towards the [Backend API Request Rate Limit](/docs/backend-requests/resources/rate-limits).

For more information on `currentUser()`, see the [reference](/docs/references/nextjs/current-user){{ target: '_blank' }}.

```astro {{ filename: 'src/pages/form.astro' }}
---
if (Astro.request.method === 'POST') {
  const user = await Astro.locals.currentUser()

  if (!user) {
    throw new Error('You must be signed in to use this feature')
  }

  const data = await Astro.request.formData()
  const serverData = {
    usersHobby: data.get('hobby'),
    userId: user.id,
    profileImage: user.imageUrl,
  }

  console.log('add item action completed with user details ', serverData)
}
---

<form method="POST">
  <input value="soccer" type="text" name="hobby" />
  <button type="submit">Submit your hobby</button>
</form>
```
