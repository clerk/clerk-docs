## Organization

`Organization` represents a Clerk organization and provides member, invitation, and domain management helpers. You can access an organization from `organizationMembership.organization` when working with memberships.

### Update organization details

```swift
let updatedOrganization = try await organization.update(
  name: "Acme",
  slug: "acme"
)
```

### Manage members

#### Add member

```swift
let membership = try await organization.addMember(
  userId: userId,
  role: "org:member"
)
```

#### Update member role

```swift
let updatedMembership = try await organization.updateMember(
  userId: userId,
  role: "org:admin"
)
```

#### Remove member

```swift
let removedMembership = try await organization.removeMember(userId: userId)
```

### Invitations

#### Invite a member

```swift
let invitation = try await organization.inviteMember(
  emailAddress: "new@acme.com",
  role: "org:member"
)
```

### Domains

#### Create a domain

```swift
let domain = try await organization.createDomain(domainName: "acme.com")
```

#### List domains

```swift
let domains = try await organization.getDomains()
```

### Requests and suggestions

#### List membership requests

```swift
let requests = try await organization.getMembershipRequests()
```

## Organization membership

`OrganizationMembership` represents a user's membership within an organization. You can access a membership from `user.organizationMemberships` or from `organization.getMemberships(...)`.

### Update role

```

### Remove membership

```swift
let deletedMembership = try await membership.destroy()
```

## Organization invitations

`OrganizationInvitation` represents an invitation sent to join an organization. You can access an invitation from `organization.getInvitations(...)`.

### Revoke an invitation

```swift
let revokedInvitation = try await invitation.revoke()
```

## Organization domains

`OrganizationDomain` represents a verified email domain for an organization. You can access a domain from `organization.getDomains(...)` or `organization.getDomain(domainId:)`.

### Verify a domain

```swift
var domain = try await organization.createDomain(domainName: "acme.com")
domain = try await domain.sendEmailCode(affiliationEmailAddress: "admin@acme.com")
domain = try await domain.verifyCode("123456")
```

### Delete a domain

```swift
try await domain.delete()
```

## Membership requests

`OrganizationMembershipRequest` represents a user's request to join an organization. You can access a membership request from `organization.getMembershipRequests(...)`.

### Accept or reject

```

#### Reject a request

```

## Organization suggestions

`OrganizationSuggestion` represents a suggested organization the user can join. You can access an organization suggestion from `user.getOrganizationSuggestions(...)`.

### Accept a suggestion

```

## Roles and permissions

Use roles and permissions to control access within organizations.

### RoleResource

`RoleResource` describes a role and its permissions.

```swift
let roles = try await organization.getRoles()
let admin = roles.data.first { $0.key == "org:admin" }
```

### PermissionResource

```
