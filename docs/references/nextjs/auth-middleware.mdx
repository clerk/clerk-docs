# `authMiddleware()`

The `authMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Next.js application through middleware. `authMiddleware()` is compatible with both the App and Pages routers.

## Usage

Create the `middleware.ts` file in the root folder of your application, or inside the `src/` if that is how your app is set up.

<Callout type="info">
  For more information about middleware in Next.js, see the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware).
</Callout>

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default authMiddleware();

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],
};
```

With the recommended matcher, all routes are protected by Clerk's authentication middleware, with the exception of internal `/_next/` routes and static files. Static files are detected by matching on paths that end in `.+\..+`. If your middleware needs to run on all routes but you don't want Clerk to protect every route, use the [`ignoredRoutes` option](#options).

### Using `afterAuth()` for fine-grained control

Some developers will need to handle specific cases such as handling redirects differently or detecting if a user is inside an organization. These cases can be handled with `afterAuth()`.

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import { authMiddleware, redirectToSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs';

export default authMiddleware({
  afterAuth(auth, req, evt) {
    // handle users who aren't authenticated
    if (!auth.userId && !auth.isPublicRoute) {
      return redirectToSignIn({ returnBackUrl: req.url });
    }
    // redirect them to organization selection page
    if(auth.userId && !auth.orgId && req.nextUrl.pathname !== "/org-selection"){
      const orgSelection = new URL('/org-selection', req.url)
      return NextResponse.redirect(orgSelection)
    }
  }
});
```

### Using `beforeAuth()` to execute middleware before authentication

If you need additional middleware handlers to execute before Clerk's authentication middleware, use `beforeAuth()`. An example where the middleware handler from `next-intl` is executed can be seen below.

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

import createMiddleware from "next-intl/middleware";

const intlMiddleware = createMiddleware({
  locales: ["en", "el"],

  defaultLocale: "en",
});

export default authMiddleware({
  beforeAuth: (req) => {
    // Execute next-intl middleware before Clerk's auth middleware
    return intlMiddleware(req);
  },

  // Ensure that locale specific sign-in pages are public
  publicRoutes: ["/", "/:locale/sign-in"],
});

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],
};
```

### Making pages public using `publicRoutes`

By default, Clerk's `authMiddleware()` treats all routes as private if the middleware runs. If you need to make specific routes public, use the `publicRoutes` option.

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";
export default authMiddleware({
  // "/" will be accessible to all users
  publicRoutes: ["/"]
});

export const config = {
      matcher: ['/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],
};
```

If you are building your own sign in pages, you don't need to add these pages to your `publicRoutes`. They will be inferred from your `.env` file:

```ts filename=".env"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
```

### Execution order of `beforeAuth`, `publicRoutes`, and `afterAuth`
  
If you define an `afterAuth` function, it will run even if the request corresponds to a private route and no user is signed out. If you don’t define an `afterAuth` function, a redirect response to the `signInUrl` will be returned automatically. This diagram explains how and when the two handlers are invoked in the runtime.

## Options

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `afterAuth?` | `function` | Called after the authentication middleware is executed. This function has access to the [`Authentication`](/docs/references/nextjs/authentication-object) object and can be used to execute logic based on the auth state. |
| `apiRoutes?` | `string[]` | A list of routes that should return 401. You can use glob patterns to match multiple routes or a function to match against the request object. For example: `['/foo', '/bar(.*)']` or [/^\/foo\/.*$/] |
| `audience?` | `string | string[]` | A string or list of audiences. |
| `authorizedParties?` | `string[]` | An allowlist of origins to verify against, to protect your application from the subdomain cookie leaking attack.<br/>For example:<br/>`['http://localhost:3000', 'https://example.com']`<br/>For more information, refer to the [reference guide](/docs/references/nodejs/token-verification#validate-the-authorized-party-of-a-session-token). |
| `beforeAuth?` | `function` | A function called before the authentication middleware is executed. If a redirect response is returned, the middleware will respect it and redirect the user. If `false` is returned, the auth middleware will not execute and the request will be handled as if the auth middleware was not present. |
| `clockSkewInSeconds?` | `number` | Overrides the default allowed clock skew. |
| `debug?` | `boolean` | Enables debugging mode in the Clerk middleware handler. Logs out additional debugging information. |
| `domain?` | `string` | The domain used for satellites to inform Clerk where this application is deployed. |
| `isSatellite?` | `boolean` | When using Clerk's satellite feature, this should be enabled for secondary domains. |
| `proxyUrl?` | `string` | If using a proxy, specify the URL of the proxy. |
| `jwksCacheTtlInMs?` | `number` | Set the JWKs cache TTL, in milliseconds. |
| `jwtKey?` | `string` | An optional [custom JWT key](/docs/references/nodejs/token-verification#networkless-token-verification-using-the-jwt-verification-key) to use for session token validation. |
| `ignoredRoutes?` | `string[]` | A list of routes that should be ignored by the middleware. This list typically includes routes for static files or Next.js internals. For improved performance, these routes should be skipped using the default config.matcher instead. |
| `publicRoutes?` | `string[]` | A list of routes that should be accessible without authentication. You can use glob patterns to match multiple routes or a function to match against the request object. For example: `['/foo', '/bar(.*)']` or [/^\/foo\/.*$/]<br/>The sign in and sign up URLs are included by default, unless a function is provided. |
| `publishableKey` | `string` | An alternate Clerk publishable key. |
| `secretKey?` | `string` | An alternate Clerk secret key. |
| `signInUrl?` | `string` | An alternative sign in URL. |
| `skipJwksCache?` | `boolean` | Disables use of the JWKs cache. |
| `apiKey?` | `string` | An alternate Clerk API key. |
| `frontendApi?` | `string` | An alternate Clerk frontend API URL. |
