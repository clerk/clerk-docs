`OrganizationCustomPermissionKey` is a type that represents a user's permission in an organization. It will be string unless the developer has provided their own types through [`ClerkAuthorization`](/docs/guides/development/override-clerk-types-interfaces#example-custom-roles-and-permissions).

Clerk provides [default system permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions#system-permissions). However, you can create [custom permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions#custom-permissions) as well.
