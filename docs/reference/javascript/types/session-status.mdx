type SessionStatus =
  | 'abandoned'
  | 'active'
  | 'pending'
  | 'ended'
  | 'expired'
  | 'removed'
  | 'replaced'
  | 'revoked'
```

| `abandoned` | The session was abandoned client-side. |
| `active` | The session is valid and all activity is allowed. |
| `pending` | The user has signed in but hasn't completed [session tasks](/docs/guides/configure/session-tasks). |
| `ended` | The user signed out of the session, but the [`Session`][session-ref] remains in the [`Client`][client-ref] object. |
| `expired` | The period of allowed activity for this session has passed. |
| `removed` | The user signed out of the session and the [`Session`][session-ref] was removed from the [`Client`][client-ref] object. |
