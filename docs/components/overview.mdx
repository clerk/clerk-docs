Clerk offers a comprehensive suite of components designed to seamlessly integrate authentication and multi-tenancy into your application.

## Control components

{/* TODO(Alexis): update with new callout */}

Control components manage authentication-related behaviors in your application. They handle tasks such as controlling content visibility based on user authentication status, managing loading states during authentication processes, and redirecting users to appropriate pages. Control components render at `<Loading />` and `<Loaded />` states for assertions on the [`Clerk` object](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk). A common example is the [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in) component, which allows you to conditionally render content only when a user is authenticated.
