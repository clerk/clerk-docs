description: Configure the Clerk Android SDK with your publishable key.
sdk: android
---

Initialize [`Clerk`](/docs/reference/native-sdks/clerk) once at app launch in your `Application` class before accessing any Clerk features.

## Basic configuration

<Include src="_partials/android/initialize-clerk" />

Register your Application class in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application android:name=".MyClerkApp">
    ...
</application>
```

## Wait for initialization

The Clerk SDK initialization is non-blocking. Listen for the SDK to be ready before using Clerk features:

```kotlin
import com.clerk.api.Clerk
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.first

// Wait for initialization
Clerk.isInitialized.first { it }

// Now safe to use Clerk
val user = Clerk.userFlow.value
```
