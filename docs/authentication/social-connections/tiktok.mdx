How to set up social connection with TikTok

## Overview

Adding social connection with TikTok to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses  preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to create your own developer account with **TikTok** and generate your own Client ID and Client secret.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you set up a TikTok developer account  and a TikTok OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a TikTok Developer account. To create one, visit the [TikTok for developers](https://developers.tiktok.com/) page and click on Login ➜ Sign Up

## Configuring TikTok social connection

First, you need to create a new TikTok app. Go to the [TikTok for developers](https://developers.tiktok.com/) page, login with your developer account and create a new app by clicking on the **My Apps** ➜ **Connect a new app** and following the on screen wizard.

Add an icon and a name for your new project and hit **Start**.

You'll get redirected to the app creation form. Notice that you need to fill the **Callback URL** and **Redirect domain** fields. In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)** and enable TikTok. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**.

Go back to the TikTok panel, paste the value into the **Callback URL** field. Copy the `clerk.[your-domain].com` part of the URL and paste it in the **Redirect domain** field. Hit **Apply** to compete the registration.

> Your app needs to be reviewed by TikTok before the registration completes. Note that this might take a couple of days.

Once your app is approved, simply copy the **Client Key** and **Client Secret** from the TikTok panel, go back to the Clerk dashboard, open the **Manage credentials** modal for the TikTok provider, and paste them into the respective fields.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with TikTok is now configured for your instance.
