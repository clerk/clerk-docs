Integrating [InstantDB](https://www.instantdb.com/) with Clerk gives you the benefits of using an InstantDB database while leveraging Clerk's authentication, prebuilt components, and webhooks.

This guide will walk you through the steps to integrate InstantDB with Clerk in your Next.js app.

<Steps>
  ### Configure your Clerk session token

  InstantDB uses Clerk's [session token](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens) to authenticate users. To use InstantDB with Clerk, you need to include the `email` claim in your session token.

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=sessions).
  1. In the navigation sidebar, select **Sessions**.
  1. In the **Customize session token** section, select **Edit**.
  1. Add the `email` claim to your session token:
     ```json
     {
       "email": "{{user.primary_email_address}}"
     }
     ```

  You can have additional claims as long as the `email` claim is set to `{{user.primary_email_address}}`.

  ### Get your Clerk publishable key

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
  1. In the navigation sidebar, select **API Keys**.
  1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable key.

  ### Configure InstantDB

  1. Navigate to the [InstantDB dashboard](https://www.instantdb.com/dash?t=auth).
  1. Select the **Auth** tab.
  1. Select **Setup Clerk**.
  1. Add the publishable key you copied in the previous step.
  1. Confirm the **The session token has the "email" claim.** message.
  1. Select **Add Clerk app**.

  ### Install the InstantDB library

  Add the InstantDB library to your project.

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm i @instantdb/react
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @instantdb/react
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @instantdb/react
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Integrate InstantDB to your Clerk application

  To sign in to InstantDB with Clerk, you need to:

  - Initialize InstantDB with your Clerk publishable key.
  - Use Clerk's `getToken()` helper to get the session for the user that is signed in to Clerk.
  - Pass the session to InstantDB's `db.auth.signInWithIdToken()` method in order to sign in to InstantDB. When you call `db.auth.signInWithIdToken()`, InstantDB will verify that the session was signed by your Clerk app. If verified, InstantDB uses the email in the session's claims to sign in, look up your user, or create a new one.

  To sign out of the application, call both InstantDB's `db.auth.signOut()` method and Clerk's `signOut()` method.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
  'use client'

  import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'
  import { init } from '@instantdb/react'
  import { useEffect } from 'react'

  // Insert your app ID from https://instantdb.com/dash
  const APP_ID = '<YOUR_APP_ID>'
  // Use the Clerk client name that you set in the "Auth" tab of the InstantDB dashboard
  const CLERK_CLIENT_NAME = 'clerk'

  // Initialize InstantDB
  const db = init({ appId: APP_ID })

  export default function Page() {
    // Use `useAuth()` to get the `getToken()` and `signOut()` methods
    const { getToken, signOut } = useAuth()

    // Create a function to sign in to InstantDB with the Clerk token
    const signInToInstantWithClerkToken = async () => {
      // Get the JWT (token) from Clerk for your signed-in user
      const token = await getToken()

      if (!token) {
        return
      }

      // Create a long-lived session with InstantDB for your Clerk user
      // It will look up the user by email or create a new user with
      // the email provided in the session token
      db.auth.signInWithIdToken({
        clientName: CLERK_CLIENT_NAME,
        idToken: token,
      })
    }

    useEffect(() => {
      signInToInstantWithClerkToken()
    }, [])

    const { isLoading, user, error } = db.useAuth()

    if (isLoading) {
      return <div>Loading...</div>
    }

    if (error) {
      return <div>Error signing in to InstantDB! {error.message}</div>
    }

    if (user) {
      return (
        <div>
          <p>Signed in with InstantDB through Clerk!</p>{' '}
          <button
            onClick={() => {
              // First sign out of InstantDB to clear the InstantDB session
              db.auth.signOut().then(() => {
                // Then, sign out of Clerk to clear the Clerk session
                signOut()
              })
            }}
          >
            Sign out
          </button>
        </div>
      )
    }
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={signInToInstantWithClerkToken}>Sign in to InstantDB</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```
</Steps>
