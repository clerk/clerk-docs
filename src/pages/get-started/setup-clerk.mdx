Creating a Clerk account and using it in your apps is a simple three-step process:

<Steps>

    ### Step 1: Create a Clerk account

    [Go to Clerk's sign-up page](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up) and create an account.

    <br/>
    {/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}
    <div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)", maxWidth: "400px"}}>![](./create-clerk-account.png)</div>
    <br/>

    ### Step 2: Create a Clerk application

    Once you've created an account, you'll be redirected to [your Clerk dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).

    On a freshly created account, you won't have any applications. To create one, press the "Add application" card:

    <br/>
    {/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}
    <div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)", maxWidth: "400px"}}>![](./add-application.png)</div>
    <br/>

    When the "Add application" card is pressed, you'll be directed to create your `<SignIn>` component, and select your preferred
    auth providers.

    <br/>
    {/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}
    <div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)"}}>![](./create-sign-in-comp.png)</div>
    <br/>

    > [We provide over 20 authentication providers that you can utilize in your Clerk apps.](/users/authentication-providers/overview)

    Once done, you should see a list of API keys that make setting up a new codebase easier.

    <br/>
    {/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}
    <div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)"}}>![](./env-keys.png)</div>
    <br/>

    ### Step 3: Spin up a new codebase

    The API keys listed in the dashboard are just the first step to integrating Clerk into your apps. To get the most out
    of Clerk, check out our "Quickstart" guides:
