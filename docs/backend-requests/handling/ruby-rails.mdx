# Handling requests with Rack and Rails

The Clerk Ruby SDK comes with Rack middleware to lazily load the Clerk session and user. If added as a gem to Rails application, the `Clerk::Authenticatable` concern can be added to your controller.

```ruby
require "clerk/authenticatable"

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include Clerk::Authenticatable
end
```

This gives your controller and views access to the following methods:

- `clerk_session`
- `clerk_user`
- `clerk_user_signed_in?`

If you want to protect a subset of your controllers (for example, if you have an admin section), you can add a `before_filter` like this:

```ruby
class AdminController < ApplicationController
  before_action :require_clerk_session

  private
  def require_clerk_session
    redirect_to clerk_sign_in_url unless clerk_session
  end
end
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Don't forget to set the environment variable `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` or the method `clerk_sign_in_url` will fail.
</Callout>
