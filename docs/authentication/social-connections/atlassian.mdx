How to set up social connection with Atlassian

## Overview

Adding social connection with Atlassian to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you will need to populate the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses  preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client Secret using your Atlassian account.

> [!NOTE]
> The purpose of this guide is to help you create an Atlassian account and an Atlassian OAuth 2.0 Integration - if you're looking for step-by-step  instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your  application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Atlassian developer account. To create one, [click here](https://developer.atlassian.com/).

## Configuring an Atlassian OAuth 2.0 Integration

You can navigate to the [list of all your apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/) to select an existing app or create a new one:

![Atlassian app listing](/docs/images/authentication-providers/atlassian/37ec3daaa6d6eaa060ad7fecb112ae6d1ef46597-3456x1844.png)

From there, click on the desired existing app or create a new one, which will take you to the app page.

![Atlassian OAuth 2.0 app page](/docs/images/authentication-providers/atlassian/597e9bdc5a6b521bcbf8223c04a1102683bf9231-3456x1730.png)

While not necessary for the integration to work, you can edit your app name, description and set a logo for it in the **Settings** tab.

![Atlassian OAuth 2.0 settings page](/docs/images/authentication-providers/atlassian/b2762ea10eebe6f05f39aa9ed33c54ca41bc2f3d-3456x1730.png)

From the app page, click on the **Permissions** tab in the sidebar menu.

![Atlassian OAuth 2.0 Integration permissions](/docs/images/authentication-providers/atlassian/04fa49b7d9ba58c0faf2c2b97f85b5ea17a9ebe6-3456x1730.png)

Here, you will need to configure the OAuth 2.0 scopes that should be requested from your users when they attempt to connect with Atlassian.

At the very minimum, you will need to enable the **User identity API**, which corresponds to the `read:me` OAuth 2.0 scope. This enables Clerk to retrieve basic user profile info when creating users for your app.

Afterwards, you will need to set up the Callback URL so that Atlassian can redirect back to your Clerk app upon successful connection.

This is done by navigating to the Authorization section and clicking on Add.

![Atlassian OAuth 2.0 Authorization page](/docs/images/authentication-providers/atlassian/3d60a54bb48c03257afbf769f1f50cf45f18871c-3456x1730.png)

In this section, you will need to paste the Authorized redirect URI that Clerk has provided for you.

After entering the callback URL, the Client ID & Client Secret will now be available in the **Settings** tab:

![Atlassian OAuth 2.0 settings page with Client ID & Client Secret](/docs/images/authentication-providers/atlassian/fdc89459cdc6450c4dbde713e7b840d93b01c862-3456x1730.png)

You will need to copy these values and paste:

- The Atlassian Client ID to the **Client ID** input on Clerk
- The Atlassian Client Secret to the **Client Secret** input on Clerk

![Client ID and Client Secret inputs for Atlassian connection](/docs/images/authentication-providers/atlassian/6ef7100945fb68a379b35a5c295a76405a2cf10e-1156x1354.png)

If you have enabled further scopes on Atlassian, you can add them in the  Clerk Atlassian configuration settings as well. This will affect the  tokens that Atlassian issues to you, so that you can access the intended Atlassian resources.

Finally, you will need to make your Atlassian app publicly accessible, since it  starts out as private by default. This is done from the **Distribution** tab:

![Atlassian OAuth 2.0 app distribution settings](/docs/images/authentication-providers/atlassian/83d5498c454f5ba0b92a76c4a1942e9a07cde48d-3456x1730.png)

After clicking on **Edit**, you will need to provide the following information and save the form:

- Set the distribution status to **Sharing**
- Enter your vendor name
- Enter a link to your privacy policy page
- Enter a link to yout terms page
- Add a contact page link (optional)
- Indicate that your data _does_ store data, since at the very least the user profile info is used to create users on the Clerk end

![Atlassian OAuth2 distribution sharing form](/docs/images/authentication-providers/atlassian/07c724b9a66773c94c169cc2a199a549c45d8fdd-3456x1730.png)

Notes:

- To be able to connect, the user must have access to at least one Atlassian site (e.g. JIRA, Confluence)
- Currently the user can authorize access only to a single Atlassian site

Congratulations! Social connection with Atlassian is now configured for your instance.
