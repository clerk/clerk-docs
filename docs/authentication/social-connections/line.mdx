  - Use LINE to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with LINE allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their LINE account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **LINE**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

<Callout type="info">
  Clerk's preconfigured shared OAuth credentials use **Japan** as the LINE region.
</Callout>

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/).

  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **LINE**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Callback URL** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Create a LINE app

  1. In the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/), select **Create a new provider**. A modal will open.
  1. Fill out the necessary information. Select **Create**. You'll be redirected to the app's **Channels** tab.
  1. Select **Create a LINE Login channel**.
  1. Fill out the necessary information. Select **Create**. You'll be redirected to the app's **Basic settings**.

  1. Select **Update**.

  ### Set the Channel ID and Channel Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open. Paste the **Channel ID** and **Channel Secret** values that you saved into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the values into their respective fields.
