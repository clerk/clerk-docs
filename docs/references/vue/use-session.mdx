title: useSession()
description: Access and manage the current user's session in your Vue application with Clerk's useSession() composable.

The `useSession()` composable provides access to the current user's [`Session`](/docs/references/javascript/session) object, as well as helpers for setting the active session.

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `isLoaded`
  - `Ref<boolean>`

  A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads.

  ---

  - `isSignedIn`
  - `Ref<boolean>`

  A boolean that is set to `true` if the user is signed in.

  ---

  - `session`
  - <code>Ref\<[Session](/docs/references/javascript/session)></code>

  Holds the current active session for the user.
</Properties>

## How to use the `useSession()` composable

### Check the current state of a session

Use `useSession()` to access the `Session` object, which has the `lastActiveAt` property. The `lastActiveAt` property is a `Date` object used to show the time the session was last active.

```vue {{ filename: 'SessionStatus.vue' }}
<script setup>
import { useSession } from '@clerk/vue'

const { isLoaded, session, isSignedIn } = useSession()
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">
    <!-- Handle loading state -->
  </div>

  <div v-else-if="!isSignedIn">
    <!-- Handle signed out state -->
  </div>

  <div v-else>
    <p>This session has been active since {{ session.lastActiveAt.toLocaleString() }}</p>
  </div>
</template>
```
