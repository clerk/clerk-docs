## Enable Billing

Enable Clerk billing by going to the [**Billing**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/settings) page in the Clerk Dashboard, and following the instructions.

Clerk billing applies a 0.7% transaction fee in addition to standard Stripe processing fees.

## Payment gateway

Once you have enabled billing, you will see the following **Payment gateway** options for collecting payments via Stripe:

- **Clerk development gateway**: A shared **test** Stripe account so developers can get started testing and building with billing **in development** without needing to create and configure a Stripe account.
- **Stripe account**: Use your own Stripe account.
