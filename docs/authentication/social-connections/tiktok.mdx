  - Use TikTok ID to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [TikTok](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-manage-user-access-tokens) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their TikTok account.

## Configure for your development instance

Due to TikTok's requirement to verify URL ownership for all redirect URLs, **TikTok cannot be used with shared credentials in development environments.** This is because individual users can't verify ownership of the Clerk development URL (`accounts.dev`).

However, TikTok can still be used in development environments if you create a sandbox app and configure custom credentials. In this case, there is no need to verify redirect URLs in the [sandbox environment](https://developers.tiktok.com/blog/introducing-sandbox). Instead, you can invite users who are allowed to sign in.

It is recommended to test this integration in a staging or preview environment, as shared credentials require URL verification to function properly.

## Configure for your production instance

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [TikTok Developer Portal](https://developers.tiktok.com/).

<Steps>
  ### Enable TikTok as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **TikTok**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create your app in TikTok

  > [!TIP]
  > If you're creating an app as an organization rather than as an individual developer, you must first [create an organization](https://developers.tiktok.com/organizations). For guidance on which option to choose, refer to [TikTok's guide on working with organizations](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/working-with-organizations/)**.**

  1. On a separate page, go to the [TikTok Developer Portal](https://developers.tiktok.com/) and sign in.
  1. In the top-right, select [**Developer Portal**](https://developers.tiktok.com/apps), then select **Manage apps**. You'll be redirected to the **Manage apps** page.
  1. Select **Connect an app**. Complete the form then select **Confirm**. You'll be redirected to your **App details** page.
  1. In the **Basic information** section, complete the form.
  1. Select **Verify URL properties** under any of the URL fields to verify your app URL. A modal will open.
  1. Select **Verify properties**. For the property type, select either **Domain** to verify ownership of the enter website, including subdomains, or **URL prefix** to verify ownership of a specific part of the website (e.g., `example.com/shop/`). See [the TikTok guide](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-create-an-app#verify_url_ownership) for more information.
  1. Enter your website and select **Verify**.
  1. Follow the instructions in the modal to verify your domain with your host provider. After entering the necessary information in your hosting provider's DNS settings, select **Verified**. Once your property is verified, select **Ok**.
  1. Select **Submit for review**.
  1. On the **App details** page, select the icons next to the **Client key** and **Client secret** to reveal them. Save these values somewhere secure.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Your app needs to be reviewed by TikTok before the registration completes. This process may take a few days.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ### Test your connection
