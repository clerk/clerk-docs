title: Upgrade to API version 2025-11-10
description: Learn how to upgrade to version 2025-11-10 of Clerk's API.
---

**Version 2025-11-10** of Clerk's Frontend and Backend APIs introduces updates to how Clerk Billing formats its responses. These changes improve consistency and clarity across the APIs, making them easier to work with and understand.

To use this new API version, refer to the [versioning guide](/docs/guides/development/upgrading/versioning). This guide documents all updates at the API level. Since implementation details may differ between SDKs, it will help you identify which parts of your SDK usage may require additional review in the documentation, and assist consumers using unofficial or custom API clients in managing the upgrade.

The following sections provide a detailed overview of the response type and endpoint changes. In general, these updates fall into one of the following categories:

1. **Updating branding:** Clerk Billing was originally developed under the working name "Commerce", which is why `/commerce/` appeared in endpoints. This API version standardizes on "Billing" instead of the deprecated "Commerce". Terminology has also been updated for consistency, including renaming "payment sources" to "payment methods".
1. **Clearer handling of missing or empty data:** In some cases, a response type has different information depending on the request that prompted the response. Previous API versions handled the absence of this information in inconsistent ways;sometimes using empty values (e.g., `""` for strings or `0` for numbers), sometimes `null`, and sometimes omitting the field entirely. Version 2025-11-10 introduces standardized semantics:
   - If the response explicitly indicates that the data doesn't exist, it will be set to `null`.
   - If the response is not making any assertion about the existence of the data, it will not include the key at all.
   - If the response is trying to tell you that the data is set to the empty value (e.g., `""` for strings, `0` for numbers), it will be set to that value.
1. **Removal of deprecated fields:** As our API responses have evolved, several response fields were deprecated but retained for backwards compatibility. This API version removes those deprecated fields.
