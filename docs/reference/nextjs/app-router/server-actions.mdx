Clerk provides helpers that are specific for server-side usage. The following guide provides examples for using these helpers with Server Actions in Server Components and in Client Components.

## With Server Components

### Protect your Server Actions

You can use the `isAuthenticated` property from the [`auth()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth) helper to protect your Server Actions. If `isAuthenticated` is `false`, then the user is not signed in.

```tsx {{ filename: 'actions.ts' }}
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default function AddToCart() {
  async function addItem(formData: FormData) {
    'use server'

    const { isAuthenticated } = await auth()

    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      throw new Error('You must be signed in to add an item to your cart')
    }

    console.log('add item server action', formData)
  }

  return (
    <form action={addItem}>
      <input value={'test'} type="text" name="name" />
      <button type="submit">Add to Cart</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

When performing Organization-related operations, you can use `auth().orgId` to check a user's Organization ID before performing an action.

```tsx {{ filename: 'actions.ts' }}
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default function AddVerifiedDomain() {
  async function addVerifiedDomain(formData: FormData) {
    'use server'

    const { isAuthenticated, orgId } = await auth()

    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      throw new Error('You must be signed in to add a verified domain')
    }

    if (!orgId) {
      throw new Error('No Active Organization found. Set one as active or create/join one')
    }

    const domain = formData.get('domain')?.toString()
    if (!domain) {
      throw new Error('Domain is required')
    }

    await clerkClient().organizations.createOrganizationDomain({
      organizationId: orgId,
      name: domain,
      enrollmentMode: 'automatic_invitation',
    })

    console.log(`Added domain ${domain} to Organization ${orgId}`)
  }

  return (
    <form action={addVerifiedDomain}>
      <input placeholder="example.com" type="text" name="domain" />
      <button type="submit">Add Domain</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

For more examples on how to use the `auth()` helper, see the [`auth()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth) reference.

### Read user data

To retrieve information about the current user in your Server Actions, you can use the [`currentUser()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/current-user) helper, which returns the [`Backend User`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-user) object of the currently active user. **It does count towards the [Backend API request rate limit](/docs/guides/how-clerk-works/system-limits)** so it's recommended to use the [`useUser()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-user) hook on the client-side when possible and only use `currentUser()` when you specifically need user data in a server context. For more information on this helper, see the [`currentUser()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/current-user) reference.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
import { auth, currentUser } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default function AddHobby() {
  async function addHobby(formData: FormData) {
    'use server'

    const { isAuthenticated } = await auth()
    const user = await currentUser()

    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      throw new Error('You must be signed in to use this feature')
    }

    const serverData = {
      usersHobby: formData.get('hobby'),
      userId: user.id,
      profileImage: user.imageUrl,
    }

    console.log('add item server action completed with user details ', serverData)
  }

  return (
    <form action={addHobby}>
      <input value={'soccer'} type="text" name="hobby" />
      <button type="submit">Submit your hobby</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## With Client Components

When you define a Server Action inside a Client Component, the request headers are not available by default because Client Components run in the browser and headers are only available in a server-side context. This is an issue for Clerk's server-side helpers, like `auth()` and `currentUser()`, as they require the request headers to be available in order to work. So if you are using these helpers in a Server Action that's being called inside a Client Component, you need to **pass the Server Action as a prop** to the Client Component.

The following example demonstrates the flow of data from the Server Action being passed to the Client Component, and the Client Component being used on a page. Use the tabs to view the example code for each file.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["Server Action", "Client Component", "Page"]}>
  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/actions.ts' }}
  'use server'
  import { auth, currentUser } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  export async function addHobby(formData: FormData) {
    const { isAuthenticated } = await auth()
    const user = await currentUser()

    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      throw new Error('You must be signed in to use this feature')
    }

    const serverData = {
      usersHobby: formData.get('hobby'),
      userId: user.id,
      profileImage: user.imageUrl,
    }

    console.log('add Hobby completed with user details ', serverData)
  }
  ```

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/components/AddHobby.tsx' }}
  'use client'

  export default function UI({ addHobby }) {
    return (
      <form action={addHobby}>
        <input value={'soccer'} type="text" name="hobby" />
        <button type="submit">Submit your hobby</button>
      </form>
    )
  }
  ```

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
  import AddHobby from './components/AddHobby'
  import { addHobby } from './actions'
  export default function Hobby() {
    return <AddHobby addHobby={addHobby} />
  }
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>
