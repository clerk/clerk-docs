The following example **will both sign up _and_ sign in users**, eliminating the need for a separate sign-up page. However, if you want to have separate sign-up and sign-in pages, the sign-up and sign-in flows are equivalent, meaning that all you have to do is swap out the `SignIn` object for the `SignUp` object using the [`useSignUp()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-sign-up) hook.

The following example:

1. Accesses the [`SignIn`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-in) object using the [`useSignIn()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-sign-in) hook.
1. Starts the authentication process by calling [`SignIn.sso(params)`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-in-future#sso). This method requires the following params:
   - `redirectUrl`: The URL that the browser will be redirected to once the user authenticates with the identity provider if no additional requirements are needed, and a session has been created
   - `redirectCallbackUrl`: The URL that the browser will be redirected to once the user authenticates with the identity provider if additional requirements are needed
1. Creates a route at the URL that the `redirectCallbackUrl` param points to. The following example re-uses the `/sign-in` route, which should be written to handle when a sign-in attempt is in a non-complete status such as `needs_second_factor`.
