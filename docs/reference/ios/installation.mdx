description: Install the Clerk iOS SDK with Swift Package Manager.
sdk: ios

Use Swift Package Manager to add `ClerkKit` (core API) and `ClerkKitUI` (prebuilt SwiftUI views) to your app target.

## Install via Xcode

1. In Xcode, select **File ▸ Add Packages...**.
1. Paste the repository URL: `https://github.com/clerk/clerk-ios`.
1. Set the dependency rule to **Up to Next Major Version** and select the latest version.
1. Make sure your app target is selected in **Add to Project** and click **Add Package**.
1. Select `ClerkKit` and `ClerkKitUI` for your target, then click **Add Package**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to use Clerk's [prebuilt views](/docs/reference/views/overview), you can just add `ClerkKit`.

## Install via Package.swift

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/clerk/clerk-ios", from: "0.1.0")
]

targets: [
  .target(
    name: "YourApp",
    dependencies: [
      .product(name: "ClerkKit", package: "clerk-ios"),
      .product(name: "ClerkKitUI", package: "clerk-ios")
    ]
