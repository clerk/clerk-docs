> [!CAUTION]
> The entire session token has a max size of 4kb. Exceeding this size can have adverse effects, including a possible infinite redirect loop for users who exceed this size in Next.js applications.
> It's recommended to move particularly large claims out of the JWT and fetch these using a separate API call from your backend.
