# Set up a preview environment with Clerk

Popular hosting providers such as Cloudflare, Vercel, and more, offer preview deployments, which enable you to view changes to your site in a live environment before merging and deploying them to production.

There are two approaches to using Clerk in a preview environment:

- If you want to share *production* data with your preview environment, [use your production API keys](#use-your-production-api-keys), which will require you to lock in your preview environment to Vercel and use Vercel's Preview Deployment Suffix feature.
- If you do not want to, or are not able to, expose *production* Clerk data to your preview environment, [use your development API keys.](#use-your-development-api-keys)

## Use your production API keys

If you would like your preview environment to share a userbase and settings configuration with your production environment, you must set up your preview environment to use your production instance API keys, which will require you to lock in your preview environment to Vercel and use [Vercel's Preview Deployment Suffix feature.](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/generated-urls#preview-deployment-suffix)

> [!WARNING]
> To use Clerk with Vercel's Preview Deployment Suffix, you must have a [Pro](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/pro) or [Enterprise](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/generated-urls#preview-deployment-suffix:~:text=Pro%20and%20Enterprise%20plans) Vercel account.

<Steps>

### Deploy to production

If your Clerk application isn't already deployed to production, follow the [Deploy to Vercel guide](/docs/deployments/deploy-to-vercel) to deploy your application.

### Acquire a separate domain

In this case, since the deployment of your preview environment will be separate from the deployment of your production environment, you will need a separate domain for your preview deployments. Having a separate domain is important to ensure your users' security by restricting production redirects to fall under your production domain. This prevents bad actors from maliciously requesting sign-in access to their own domains.

The domain *cannot be a subdomain* of the domain used for your production deployment. For example, if your production domain is `my-site.com`, you could use `my-site-previews.com` but you cannot use `previews.my-site.com`.

### Set up your Preview Deployment Suffix

Vercel's Preview Deployment Suffix feature allows you to customize the URL of a preview deployment by replacing the default `vercel.app` suffix with a custom domain of your choice. Use the separate domain you acquired when following Vercel's guide for setting up your [Preview Deployment Suffix](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/generated-urls#preview-deployment-suffix).

</Steps>

### Limitations of using production keys

- This approach requires a Vercel Pro or Enterprise account.
- This approach locks you into using Vercel for preview environments.

## Use your development API keys

If you would like your preview environment to have a different userbase from your production environment, you can set up your preview environment to use your development instance API keys.

<Steps>

### Retrieve your development instance API keys

To retrieve your development instance API keys:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
2. Ensure that **Development** is selected at the top.
3. In the navigation sidebar, select **API Keys**.
4. Copy your keys.

### Add your API keys to your environment variables

Once you have your development instance API keys, you can add them to your environment variables.

The following are environment variable guides from some popular providers:
    - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#declare-an-environment-variable)
    - [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/get-started/#create-environment-variables)
    - [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/environment-variables/#add-environment-variables-via-the-dashboard)

</Steps>

### Limitations of using development keys

The limitations of using development instance API keys in preview environments are:

- Added possibility of Clerk cookie errors. Remember to clear your cookies if you are encountering infinite redirects or authentication issues.
- Changes to user data will not be automatically mirrored in your main application for your production environment.
- There is a [maximum user limit](/docs/deployments/environments#development-instance).
- Features enabled in your development instance will not be available in your production environment without upgrading your Clerk plan.
- Development instance API keys offer less security overall compared to production instance keys.

See [the development instance documentation](/docs/deployments/environments#development-instance) to learn more.

## Staging environments

You can also use Clerk with [staging environments](/docs/deployments/set-up-staging).
