## Examples

### `authenticateRequest({ req })`

Takes the token passed by the frontend as a Bearer token in the Authorization header, and performs a networkless authenication. This will verify if the user is signed into the application or not.


```tsx
import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs'
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const { isSignedIn } = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest({ request: req })

  if ( !isSignedIn ) {
    return NextResponse.json({ status: 401 })
  }
  
  // Perform protected actions

  return NextResponse.json({ message: "This is a reply" }, status: { 200 })
```
