title: Verify the active user's permissions in an organization
description: A collection of utility functions and components in order to allow developers to perform authorization checks.
---

<Callout type="info">
  The following authorization checks are predicated on a user having an active organization. Without this, they will likely always evaluate to false by default. Clerk's built-in [`<OrganizationSwitcher/>`](/docs/components/organization/organization-switcher) component and[`useOrganizationList().setActive({ organization: <orgId> })`](/docs/references/react/use-organization-list) method are two available options to set an organization as active for a user.
</Callout>

In general, you should always verify whether or not a user is authorized to access sensitive information, important content, or exclusive features. The most secure way to implement authorization is by checking the active user's [role or permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#permissions).

Clerk enables two broad approaches to role and permissions-based authorization:

1. **Immediately blocking unauthorized users**.
  - Use the [`<Protect>`](/docs/components/protect) component to prevent content from rendering if the active user is unauthorized.
  - Call [`auth().protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) to throw an error if the active user is unauthorized.
2. **Configuring custom behavior for unauthorized users*.
  - The [`has()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#has) helper returns `false` if the active user lacks the role or permissions you're checking for. You can choose how your app responds without immediately throwing an error or preventing content from rendering.

## Authorization in Client Components

The examples below work for both SSR and CSR. Examples are written for Next.js App Router but they are supported by any React meta framework, such as Remix or Gatsby.

<Tabs type="framework" items={["Next.js with <Protect>", "Next.js with has()"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following snippet uses Clerk's `<Protect>` component to only render the form for users with the `org:team_settings:manage` permission.

    ```tsx filename="/app/dashboard/settings/form.tsx"
      'use client';
      import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

      export function SettingsForm(){
        return (
          <Protect
            permission="org:team_settings:manage"
            fallback={<p>You are not allowed to see this section.</p>}
          >
            <form>
              ....
            </form>
          </Protect>
        )
      }
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The `useAuth()` hook can help you access what permissions a user has by using `has()`. In the example below, `has({ permission: "org:team_settings:manage" })` returns `false` if the user does not have the `org:team_settings:manage` permission.

    ```tsx filename="/app/dashboard/settings/form.tsx"
      'use client';
      import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

      export function SettingsForm(){
        const { has } = useAuth();

        const canManageSettings = has({ permission: "org:team_settings:manage" });

        if(!canManageSettings) return null;

        return (
          <form>
            //...
          </form>
        )
      }
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authorization in React Server Components

<Tabs type="framework" items={[ "RSC with has()", "RSC with auth().protect()", "RSC with <Protect>"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example uses `has()` to inspect a user's permissions granularly. If the user doesn't have the `org:team_settings:read` permission, the component returns `null` instead of rendering its children.

    ```tsx filename="/app/dashboard/settings/layout.tsx"
      import type { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
      import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

      export default function SettingsLayout(props: PropsWithChildren){
        const { has } = auth()

        const canAccessSettings = has({permission: "org:team_settings:read"});

        if(!canAccessSettings) return null;

        return props.children
      }
      ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Callout>
      `auth().protect()` will throw a `notFound` Next.js error if authorization checks fail.
    </Callout>

    ```tsx filename="/app/dashboard/settings/layout.tsx"
      import type { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
      import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

      export default function SettingsLayout(props: PropsWithChildren){
        const { userId } = auth().protect({permission: "org:team_settings:read"})

        return props.children
      }
      ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The following snippet uses `<Protect>`'s `condition` prop to conditionally render its children if the user has the `org:team_settings:read` permission.

      ```tsx filename="/app/dashboard/settings/layout.tsx"
        import type { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
        import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

        export default function SettingsLayout(props: PropsWithChildren){
          return (
            <Protect
              permission="org:team_settings:read"
            >
              {props.children}
            </Protect>
          )
        }
      ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authorization in endpoints

<Tabs type="framework" items={["Next.js Server Actions", "Nexjts Route Handlers", "Next.js API Routes"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```tsx
      import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

      export default function ServerComponent() {
        async function myAction() {
          'use server'
          const { has } = auth();

          const canManage = has({permission:"org:team_settings:manage"});
          ...
          // Perform a DB operation ...
        }
      }
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Callout>
      `auth().protect()` will throw a `notFound` Next.js error if authorization checks fail.
    </Callout>

    ### Using `auth().protect()`

    ```tsx
      import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

      export const POST = () => {
        const { userId } = auth().protect({
          permission: "org:team_settings:manage"
        })
        return users.createTeam(userId);
      }
    ```

    ### Using `has()`

    ```tsx
      import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

      export const GET = () => {
        const { userId, has } = auth();

        if(!userId){
          return Response.json({error: "Unathorized"}, {status: 401})
        }

        if(!has({permission: "org:team_settings:read"})){
          return Response.json({error: "Forbidden"}, {status: 403})
        }

        return users.getTeams(userId)
      }
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```tsx
      import { getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

      export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest) {
        const { userId, has } = await getAuth(req);

        if (!userId) return res.status(401);

        if(!has({permission: "org:team_settings:read"})) return res.status(403)

        return users.getTeams(userId)
      }
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authorization in Remix Loaders

<CodeBlockTabs type="framework" options={["Remix"]}>
```tsx
export const loader: LoaderFunction = async args => {
  const { has } = await getAuth(args);

  if(has({permission: "org:team_settings:manage"})){
    return redirect('/request-access');
  }
  return {};
};

export default function Settings() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Settings Page</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Authorization in JS SDK

If you are not using React or any of the meta-frameworks we support, there's a good chance that you are using Clerk.js directly. In that case, the following example can help.

<CodeBlockTabs type="framework" options={["JavaScript"]}>
  ```tsx
    import Clerk from '@clerk/clerk-js'

    const clerk = new Clerk(...)
    await clerk.load(...)

    const canManageSettings = clerk.session.checkAuthorization({
      permission: "org:team_settings:manage"
    })
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Authorize with roles

<Callout type="warning">
Performing role checks is not considered a best-practice and developers should avoid it as much as possible. Usually, complex role checks can be refactored with a single permission check.
</Callout>

You can pass a `role` the same way you can pass a `permission` in all the examples above.

<Tabs type="framework" items={[ "RSC with <Protect>","RSC with auth().protect()", "Client Component with has()", ]}>
<Tab>
  The following example uses `<Protect>`'s `condition` prop to conditionally render its children if the user is either an `org:admin` or an `org:billing_manager`.

  ```tsx filename="/app/dashboard/settings/layout.tsx"
    import type { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export default function SettingsLayout(props: PropsWithChildren){
      return (
        <Protect
          condition={has => has({role: "org:admin"}) || has({role: "org:billing_manager"})}
        >
          {props.children}
        </Protect>
      )
    }
  ```
</Tab>

<Tab>
  <Callout>
    `auth().protect()` will throw a `notFound` Next.js error if authorization checks fail.
  </Callout>

  ```tsx filename="/app/dashboard/settings/layout.tsx"
    import type { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
    import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

    export default function SettingsLayout(props: PropsWithChildren){
      const { userId } = auth().protect(has => has({role: "org:admin"}) || has({role: "org:billing_manager"}))

      return props.children
    }
  ```
</Tab>

<Tab>
  The following snippet uses `useAuth()` to inspect a user's roles granularly. If the user doesn't have either an `org:admin` or an `org:billing_manager` role, the component returns `null` instead of rendering its children.

  ```tsx filename="/app/dashboard/settings/form.tsx"
    'use client';
    import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export function SettingsForm(){
      const { has } = useAuth();
      const canAccessSettings = has({role: "org:admin"}) || has({role: "org:billing_manager"})

      if(!canManageSettings) return null;

      return (
        <form>
          //...
        </form>
      )
    }
   ```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## How to add types for roles and permissions

In order to enhance typesafety in your project, you can define a global `ClerkAuthorization` interface, which defines the acceptable values for roles and permissions.

<Callout type="info">
  By default, types related to roles and permissions, such as `OrganizationCustomRoleKey` and `OrganizationCustomPermissionKey`, will be assigned to `string` if `ClerkAuthorization` is not defined. If you define `ClerkAuthorization` in your project, `OrganizationCustomRoleKey` and `OrganizationCustomPermissionKey` will be assigned to the keys of the `ClerkAuthorization` interface.
</Callout>

In the example below, `ClerkAuthorization` is defined with the default roles that Clerk provides.

```tsx filename="types/globals.d.ts"
export { };

declare global {
  interface ClerkAuthorization {
    permission: '';
    role: 'org:admin' | 'org:member';
  }
}
```

Because Clerk supports custom roles and permissions, you can modify `ClerkAuthorization` to align with the roles and permissions configured in your Clerk application. See how in the example below, the default Clerk roles `org:admin` and `org:member` are replaced with custom roles `org:super_admin`, `org:teacher`, and `org:student`.

```tsx filename="types/globals.d.ts"
export { };

declare global {
  interface ClerkAuthorization {
    permission: 'org:quiz:create' | 'org:quiz:grade' | 'org:quiz:read' | 'org:quiz:fill';
    role: 'org:super_admin' | 'org:teacher' | 'org:student';
  }
}
```
