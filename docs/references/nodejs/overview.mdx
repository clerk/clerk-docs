# Clerk Node.js SDK

## Set up Clerk Node.js

<Steps>

### Create a Clerk application

You need to create a Clerk application in your Clerk Dashboard before you can set up Clerk Node.js. For more information, check out our [Set up your application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) guide.

### Install `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node`

Once a Clerk application has been created, you can install and then start using Clerk Node.js in your application. An ESM module for the Clerk Node SDK is available under the [`@clerk/clerk-sdk-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clerk/clerk-sdk-node) npm package.

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
```sh filename="terminal"
npm install @clerk/clerk-sdk-node
```

```sh filename="terminal"
yarn add @clerk/clerk-sdk-node
```

```sh filename="terminal"
pnpm add @clerk/clerk-sdk-node
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment variables

Below is an example of an `.env.local` file.

**Pro tip!** If you are signed into your Clerk Dashboard, your secret key should become visible by clicking on the eye icon. Otherwise, you can find your keys in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.

<InjectKeys>

```env filename=".env.local"
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
```

</InjectKeys>

</Steps>

## Available methods

All resource operations are mounted as sub-APIs on the `clerkClient` object. To access the resource operations, [you must first instantiate a `clerkClient` instance](/docs/references/nodejs/available-methods).

## Multi-session applications

If Clerk is running in multi-session mode, it's important to ensure your frontend sends the Session ID that is making the request.

Our middleware will look for a query string parameter named `_clerk_session_id`. If this parameter is not found, the middleware will instead choose the last active session, which may be subject to race conditions and should not be relied on for authenticating actions.

## Connect/Express middlewares

The Clerk Node SDK offers two [middlewares](/docs/backend-requests/handling/nodejs) to authenticate your backend endpoints.

## Manual authentication

### Authenticate a particular session

```js
import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';
import Cookies from 'cookies';

// Retrieve the particular session ID from a
// query string parameter
const sessionId = req.query._clerk_session_id;

// Note: Clerk stores the clientToken in a cookie
// named "__session" for Firebase compatibility
const cookies = new Cookies(req, res);
const clientToken = cookies.get('__session');

const session = await clerkClient.sessions.getSession(sessionId, { clientToken });
```

### Authenticate the last active session

Using the last active session is appropriate when determining the user after a navigation.

```js
import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';
import Cookies from 'cookies';

// Note: Clerk stores the clientToken in a cookie
// named "__session" for Firebase compatibility
const cookies = new Cookies(req, res);
const clientToken = cookies.get('__session');

// Verify the client using the client token
const client = await clerkClient.clients.verifyClient({ token: clientToken });
const sessionId = client.lastActiveSessionId;

const session = await clerkClient.sessions.getSession(sessionId, { clientToken });
```


## Error handling

Node SDK functions throw errors (`ClerkAPIResponseError`) when something goes wrong. You'll need to catch them in a `try/catch` block and handle them gracefully. For example:

```ts filename="example.ts"
try {
  const res = await someBackendApiCall();
} catch (error) {
  // Error handling
}
```
