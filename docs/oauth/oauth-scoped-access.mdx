title: Use OAuth for scoped access
description: Learn how to use OAuth with Clerk to grant granular permissions and manage access securely.

Clerk's OAuth implementation supports **OAuth Scoped Access**, which lets third-party applications request limited access to specific parts of a user's data through Clerk's API. This enables applications to interact with user data in a secure and controlled manner, based on the userâ€™s explicit consent. The most common implementation of OAuth Scoped Access is the "[Authorization Code Flow](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1)", which is the flow that we will walk through in this guide.

## How the flow works

Before diving into implementations details, it's important to understand the different actors involved in this flow:

- **Client** - The third-party app that wants to access a user's data from your application (resource service). This app is configured to obtain OAuth tokens from Clerk.
- **Authorization service** - The service that authorizes the user and grants the OAuth tokens. In this example, Clerk would be the authorization service.
- **Resource service** - The backend server that hosts the user's data that the client wants to access. In this example, this would be **your own application** that uses Clerk for authentication and route protection.

> [!NOTE]
> If you would like to know more about the terminology around OAuth, check out our [OAuth terminology guide](/docs/oauth/oauth-overview#key-terminology).

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to build OAuth scoped access into a Clerk application.

## Before you start

- You need to [create a Clerk account](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up) or [sign into the Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).
- You need to create a Clerk Application in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, see the [setup guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).

Let's begin by creating an OAuth application in the Clerk Dashboard.

<Steps>
  ### Create a Clerk OAuth application

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**OAuth Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/oauth-applications) page.

  1. Select the **Add OAuth application** button. A modal will open.

  1. Complete the following fields:

     - `Name` - Helps you identify your application.
     - `Scopes` - The scopes that you would like to leverage. To find out more about the scopes currently supported by Clerk, check out the [OAuth reference documentation](/docs/oauth/how-clerk-implements-oauth#scopes).

       ![A screenshot of a new OAuth application being created in the Clerk dashboard](/docs/images/oauth/dashboard-create-oauth-application.png)

  1. Select **Add**. A modal will open with your **Client Secret**.

     > [!WARNING]
     > For security reasons, Clerk does not store your Client Secret and cannot show it to you again, so make sure to copy the secret and store it someplace secure, like an environment variable.

  1. You'll be redirected to your OAuth application's settings page. Under **Application credentials**, you can find your **Client ID**, which will be necessary for to complete the OAuth flow.

  1. In the **Redirect URIs** field, add the redirect URI provided by your client. This is the URL that Clerk will redirect to with an authorization code after the user has authenticated and consented to the access request. For this example, we will use [http://localhost:3000/oauth\_callback](http://localhost:3000/oauth_callback).

     ![A screenshot of the redirect urls, client id, and client secret within an OAuth application in the Clerk dashboard](/docs/images/oauth/dashboard-oauth-client-details.png)

  The Clerk setup is now complete. If you'd like to know more about other OAuth application configuration settings, refer to the [dedicated reference documentation](/docs/oauth/how-clerk-implements-oauth).

  ### Test the OAuth flow

  If you are aiming to integrate your Clerk application with a third-party app that acts as an OAuth client, you can reference their documentation on how to integrate OAuth connections in order to test your OAuth flow. It will likely be necessary to provide the `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `redirect_uri` from the OAuth application we created above.

  If you don't have a specific, existing OAuth client in mind, you can use the following [OAuth test client](https://github.com/clerk/test-oauth-client) project. It contains a minimal Express.js server that can run through an OAuth flow. We'll walk through how to use the test client below.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This implementation follows [the OAuth specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13), and is not specific to Clerk or this test project. Any compliant OAuth client will behave the same way.

  1. Clone the [following repository](https://github.com/clerk/test-oauth-client) to your machine.

  1. In your terminal and within your project, run the following command:

     ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
     cp .env.sample .env
     ```

  1. Add the required credentials to this newly created `.env` file:

     - `CLIENT_ID`: The client ID of your OAuth app from the Clerk Dashboard.
     - `CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret of your OAuth app from the Clerk Dashboard.
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Your Clerk Publishable Key from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

  1. In your terminal, run the following command to install dependencies:

     ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
     npm i
     ```

  1. In your terminal, run the following command to start the server:

     ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
     npm start
     ```

  ### Finished ðŸŽ‰

  Once this is complete, you will be able to see the OAuth flow begin. If you are not currently signed in, you will first be presented with a sign in screen. After signing in, Clerk will redirect to an OAuth consent screen, showing the requested scopes and asking for your consent.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The consent screen uses the scopes passed in the authorization request to inform the user exactly what theyâ€™re granting access to, and to whom.
  >
  > By default, the consent screen is shown for all newly created OAuth apps, but this can be toggled in each appâ€™s settings [on the Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=oauth-applications), although not recommended.
  >
  > For more details on how our Clerk OAuth consent screen works, see the [OAuth consent screen reference docs](/docs/oauth/how-clerk-implements-oauth#consent-screen-management).

  Once you have accepted, you will be redirected to the OAuth callback route, the `redirect_uri` specified earlier. This process will exchange the authorization code for an access token, and render the access token and refresh token as a JSON response, similar to this:

  ```json
  {
    "access_token": "xxx",
    "expires_in": 7200,
    "id_token": "xxx",
    "refresh_token": "xxx",
    "scope": "openid email profile",
    "token_type": "bearer"
  }
  ```

  With the OAuth flow complete, the client now has a working access token. The next step would normally be for the client to use that token to make an authenticated request to your app's API endpoints. To learn more about how to accept and verify OAuth tokens using Clerk, see our guide on [verifying OAuth tokens](/docs/oauth/oauth-verify-tokens).
