Free trials let users experience paid features of a plan before starting a paid subscription. You can enable trials per plan or apply the same settings to all plans. The minimum trial length is 1 day.

## Enable free trials

To enable free trials for your plans:

1. Navigate to the [**Plans**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/plans) page in the Clerk Dashboard
1. Select the plan you want to add a free trial to
1. Toggle **Free trial** on
1. Set the number of trial days (minimum is 1 day)

You can apply free trial settings to all your plans or configure each plan individually.

## Eligibility

Only users who have never paid for a subscription and have never used a free trial are eligible for free trials. If a user has previously had a paid subscription to your service or has already used a free trial, they will not be able to access free trials again.

## Credit card requirement

A credit card is required to start a free trial. This requirement serves as a mechanism to prevent abuse and ensures a smooth transition to paid service when the trial expires.

## What your users experience

### During a trial

Users get access to the plan's paid features for the configured number of days.
If they cancel during the trial, they keep access until the original trial end date.

### When the trial ends

If the user didn't cancel their subscription during the trial, they are charged using their default payment method on file. This may be a different payment method than the one used during checkout when the trial started.
If the user did cancel their subscription during the trial, they lose access at the end of the trial and are moved back to the free plan. They are not charged.

## Notifications

Both you and your users receive notifications when a trial is about to expire:

### Developer notifications

You'll receive a `subscriptionItem.freeTrialEnding` webhook event 3 days before the trial expires. If the trial period is shorter than 3 days, the webhook is sent immediately when the trial begins.

### User notifications

Users receive an email notification 3 days before their trial expires. For trials shorter than 3 days, the notification is sent immediately when the trial begins.

## Managing active trials

You can manually change the duration of a user's trial:

- **Cancel at the end of the trial**: Cancel the trial while allowing the user to keep access to the paid features until the trial period ends. This prevents their default payment method from being charged when the trial period ends.
- **End immediately**: Immediately move the user back to the free plan and terminate their access to the paid features they were trialing.
- **Extend a trial:** Make a user's trial last longer. You must extend a trial by at least 1 day and no more than 365 days.

### How to extend a trial

To extend a trial for a subscription:

1. Navigate to the [**Subscriptions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/subscriptions) page in the Clerk Dashboard
1. Select the subscription you want to extend
1. Click **Extend free trial**
1. A modal will be presented to you where you can choose how to extend the trial

You can only manage the trial of a user while the trial is active. Once a trial ends, you can no longer extend or cancel it.

## User trial cancelation

When users cancel their own trial, they retain access to all trial features until the original trial period expires. Once the period ends, they are automatically moved to the free plan without being charged.
