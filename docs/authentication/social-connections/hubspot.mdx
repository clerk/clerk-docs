How to set up social connection with HubSpot

## Overview

Adding social connection with HubSpot to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses  preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to create your own developer account with **HubSpot** and generate your own Client ID and Client secret.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you set up a HubSpot developer account and a HubSpot OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your  application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a HubSpot Developer account. To create one, [click here](https://app.hubspot.com/signup/developers/step/existing-user?_ga=2.145169076.1430980384.1628431607-741498900.1628431607).

## Configuring HubSpot social connection

First, you need to create a new HubSpot app and enable OAuth support. Follow the official HubSpot [Creating an App](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/creating-an-app) guide.

Once your app is created, click on the **Auth** tab and copy the **App Id** and **Client secret**, as shown below.

In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)** and enable HubSpot. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and paste the values you obtained during the previous step.

Before you close the modal, copy the **Authorized redirect URI**. Go back to the HubSpot panel and paste it into the **Redirect URL** field and click **Save**.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with HubSpot is now configured for your instance.
