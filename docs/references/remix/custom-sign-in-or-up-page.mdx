title: Build your own sign-in-or-up page for your Remix app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add a custom sign-in-or-up page to your Remix app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component with the [Remix optional route](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/route#optional-segments) in order to build a custom page for that allows users to sign-in or sign-up within a single flow for your Remix app.

If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-in-or-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component to allow users to both sign-in or sign-up from a single flow.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-in.$.tsx' }}
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/remix'

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignIn />
  }
  ```

  ## Configure your sign-in-or-up page

  <Tabs items={["SSR Mode", "SPA Mode"]}>
    <Tab>
      For SSR Mode, add environment variables for the `signIn` and `afterSignIn` paths:

      ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
      CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
      CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_URL=/
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      For SPA Mode, add paths to your `ClerkApp` options to control the behavior of the components when you sign in or sign up and when you click on the respective links at the bottom of each component.

      ```ts {{ filename: 'app/root.tsx', mark: [[3, 4]] }}
      export default ClerkApp(App, {
        publishableKey: PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
        signInUrl: '/sign-in',
        signInFallbackRedirectUrl: '/',
      })
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ## Visit your new page

  Run your project with the following terminal command from the root directory of your project:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-in](http://localhost:3000/sign-in).
