Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK exposes the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} resources and low-level authentication utilities for JavaScript environments, making it easier to integrate Clerk into your server-side applications.

## Installation

Follow the instructions in the [JavaScript Backend SDK quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) to add the JavaScript Backend SDK to your project.

## Resources

### Users

The Backend [`User`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-user) object represents a user that has successfully signed up to your application. It holds information about a user of your application, such as their unique identifier, name, email addresses, phone numbers, and more.

### Organizations

Organizations are used to group members under a common entity and provide shared access to resources. They are represented by the Backend [`Organization`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-organization) object.

### Billing

Through the Backend Billing API, you can create and manage subscription plans and features for your application. It is represented by the Backend [`CommerceSubscription`](/docs/references/backend/types/commerce-subscription) and the Backend [`CommercePlan`](/docs/references/backend/types/commerce-plan) objects.

### Allowlist identifiers

Allowlists allow you to control who can sign up or sign in to your application, by restricting access based on the user's email address or phone number. The Backend [`AllowlistIdentifier`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-allowlist-identifier) object represents an identifier that has been added to the allowlist of your application.

### Domains

Domains represent each instance's URLs and DNS setup.

### Sessions

The Backend [`Session`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-session) object is an abstraction over an HTTP session and models the period of information exchange between a user and the server. Sessions are created when a user successfully goes through the sign-in or sign-up flows.

### Clients

The Backend [`Client`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-client) object tracks authenticated sessions for a given device or software accessing your application, such as your web browser, native application, or Chrome Extension.

### Invitations

Invitations allow you to invite someone to sign up to your application, via email. It is represented by the Backend [`Invitation`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-invitation) object.

### Redirect Urls

Redirect URLs are whitelisted URLs that facilitate secure authentication flows in native applications (e.g. React Native, Expo). In these contexts, Clerk ensures that security-critical nonces are passed only to the whitelisted URLs. It is represented by the Backend [`RedirectUrl`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-redirect-url) object.

### Email addresses

Email addresses are one of the identifiers used to provide identification for users. They must be verified to ensure that they are assigned to their rightful owners. The Backend [`EmailAddress`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-email-address) object holds all necessary state around the verification process.

### Phone numbers

Phone numbers can be used as a proof of identification for users, or simply as a means of contacting users. They must be verified to ensure that they are assigned to the rightful owners. The Backend [`PhoneNumber`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-phone-number) object holds all necessary state around the verification process.

### SAML connections

A SAML Connection holds configuration data required for facilitating a SAML SSO flow between your Clerk Instance (SP) and a particular SAML IdP. It is represented by the Backend [`SamlConnection`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-saml-connection) object, which holds information about a SAML connection for an organization.

### Sign-in tokens

Sign-in tokens are JWTs that can be used to sign in to an application without specifying any credentials. A sign-in token can be used at most once and they can be consumed from the Frontend API using the `ticket` strategy.

### Testing tokens

[Testing tokens](/docs/guides/development/testing/overview#testing-tokens) allow you to bypass bot detection mechanisms that protect Clerk applications from malicious bots, ensuring your end-to-end test suites run smoothly. Without Testing tokens, you may encounter "Bot traffic detected" errors in your requests.

### M2M tokens

[Machine-to-machine (M2M) tokens](/docs/guides/development/machine-auth/m2m-tokens) allow you to manage authentication between machines. It is intended primarily as a method for authenticating requests between different backend services within your own infrastructure.

### OAuth applications

OAuth applications contain data for clients using Clerk as an OAuth2 identity provider. It is represented by the Backend [`OAuthApplication`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-oauth-application) object, which holds information about an OAuth application.

## Authentication utilities

In addition to the resources listed above, the JavaScript Backend SDK also provides low-level authentication utilities that can be used to verify Clerk-generated tokens and authenticate requests from your frontend.

- [`authenticateRequest()`](/docs/references/backend/authenticate-request): Authenticates a token passed from the frontend.
- [`verifyToken()`](/docs/references/backend/verify-token): Verifies a Clerk-generated token signature.
- [`verifyWebhook()`](/docs/references/backend/verify-webhook): Verifies the authenticity of a webhook request using Svix.
