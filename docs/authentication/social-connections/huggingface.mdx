How to set up social connection with Hugging Face

## Overview

Adding social connection with Hugging Face to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to create your own Client ID and Client secret using your Hugging Face account.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Hugging Face Connected App - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Hugging Face account. To create one, [click here](https://huggingface.co/login).

To fill the Redirect URLs field, you need the **Authorized redirect URI** from Clerk. In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)** and enable Hugging Face. In the modal that opens, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Paste this value in the Redirect URLs field of your Hugging Face Connected App. Then click the _Create application_ button.
