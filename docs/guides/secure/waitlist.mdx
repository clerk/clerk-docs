In [**Waitlist** mode](/docs/guides/secure/restricting-access#waitlist), users can register their interest in your app by joining a waitlist. This mode is ideal for apps in early development stages or those wanting to generate interest before launch. This guide shows you how to add a waitlist to your application.

<Steps>
  ## Enable Waitlist mode

  To enable **Waitlist** mode, follow these steps:

  <Include src="_partials/waitlist/enable-waitlist-mode" />

  ## Add the `<Waitlist />` component to your app

  The [`<Waitlist />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/waitlist) component provides a form where users can submit their details to join the waitlist and express their interest in your app. Once approved by admins, users will receive an email with access instructions.

  <If sdk="nextjs">
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're using Next.js, the`<Waitlist />` component is available in `@clerk/nextjs@6.2.0` and above.
  </If>

  The following example includes a basic implementation of the `<Waitlist />` component hosted on the `/` route (the home page). You can use this as a starting point for your own implementation.

  <Include src="_partials/waitlist/waitlist-component-examples" />

  ## Provide the `waitlistUrl` prop

  To use the `<Waitlist />` component in your app, you must update your `<ClerkProvider>` in `app/layout.tsx` to include a `waitlistUrl` prop pointing to the URL of your waitlist page.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx', mark: [1] }}
  <ClerkProvider waitlistUrl="/">{/* rest of your layout */}</ClerkProvider>
  ```

  {/* ## Add a sign-in page

      To allow users to sign in once they've been approved from the waitlist, you need to set up a sign-in page.

      The following example demonstrates how to render the `<SignIn />` component, which will only be accessible to users who have been approved from the waitlist.

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx' }}
      import { SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function Page() {
        return <SignIn />
      }
      ```

      Update your environment variables to point to your custom sign-in page. For more information on building a custom sign-in-or-up page, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/development/custom-sign-in-or-up-page).

      ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
      NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL="/sign-in"
      ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > Alternatively, you can add the `waitlistUrl` prop to the `<SignIn />` component instead of `<ClerkProvider>` if needed. */}

  ## Manage users on your waitlist

  Once users join your waitlist, you can manage their access from the Clerk Dashboard. You can approve or deny users, which will trigger an email notification to them with instructions on how to access your app if approved.

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Waitlist**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/waitlist) page.
  1. On the right-side of a user's row, select the menu icon (...).
  1. Select **Invite** to invite the user to your application. Select **Deny** to deny the user access to your application.
</Steps>
