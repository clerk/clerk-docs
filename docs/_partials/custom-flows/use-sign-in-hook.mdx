First, understand that the `useSignIn()` hook returns an object with the following properties:

- `signIn`: The [`SignInFuture`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-in-future) object. Use this to initiate the sign-in process and check the current state of the sign-in attempt.
- `errors`: The [`Errors`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/errors) object that contains the errors that occurred during the last API request. You can use this to display errors to the user in your custom UI.
- `fetchStatus`: The fetch status of the underlying [`SignInFuture`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-in-future) resource. You can use this to display a loading state or disable buttons while the request is in progress.
