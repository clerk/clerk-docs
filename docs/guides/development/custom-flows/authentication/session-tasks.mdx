## Overview

[Session tasks](/docs/guides/configure/session-tasks) are pending requirements that users must complete after authentication, such as choosing an Organization. These tasks ensure that users meet all requirements before gaining full access to your application. A user's session will enter a `pending` state until all tasks are completed. By default, `pending` sessions are treated as signed-out across Clerk's authentication context.

When enabled in the Clerk Dashboard, these tasks are handled automatically within the `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` components. If the prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can opt out of using the `<SignUp />` and `<SignIn />` components and create a [custom flow](!custom-flow) to display tasks.

This guide demonstrates how to use the Clerk API to build a custom user interface for handling session tasks.
