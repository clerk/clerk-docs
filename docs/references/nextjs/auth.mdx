# `auth()`

The `auth()` helper returns the [`Authentication`](/docs/references/nextjs/authentication-object) object of the currently active user. This is the same `Authentication` object that is returned by the [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) hook. However, it can be used in Server Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions.

{/* Is this still true for clerkMiddleware? If so, update this link */}
The `auth()` helper does require [Middleware](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware). 

A Route Handler added to [`publicRoutes`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#making-pages-public-using-public-routes) can still use the [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) helper to return information about the user or their authentication state, or to control access to some or all of the Route Handler.

## Retrieving userId

```tsx filename="app/page.[jsx/tsx]"
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs';

export default function Page() {
const { userId } : { userId: string | null } = auth();
// ...
}
```

## Data fetching

When using a Clerk integration, or if you need to send a JWT along to a server, you can use the `getToken` function.

```tsx filename="app/api/example/route.[jsx/tsx]"
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs';

export async function GET() {
  const {userId, getToken} = auth();
  if(!userId){
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
  }
  const token = await getToken({template: "supabase"});
  // Fetch data from Supabase and return it.
  const data = { supabaseData: 'Hello World' };
  return NextResponse.json({ data });
}
```

## Authorization with `has`

Use `has` in order to check if a user is authorized to access a component.

```tsx filename="app/page.[jsx/tsx]"
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs';

export default async function Page() {
  const { has } = auth();

  const canManage = has({permission:"org:team_settings:manage"});

  if(!canManage) return null;  

  return <h1>Team Settings</h1>
}
```

{/* TODO: We need more documentation on has(), either a dedicated page or added right here. What are the params for it? What does it return? And examples for each of the different types of params. */}

## Authorization with `protect`

{/* Would this still be true in v5? */}
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  `auth().protect()` only works for App Router and is considered experimental.
</Callout>

```tsx filename="app/api/route.[js/ts]"
import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export const POST = () => {
  const { userId } = auth().protect({permission: "org:team_settings:manage"});

  return users.createTeam(userId);
}
```

{/* TODO: We need more documentation on protect(), either a dedicated page or added right here. What are the params for it? What does it return? And examples for each of the different types of params. */}

## Check your current user's role

In some cases, you need to check your user's current organization role before displaying data or allowing certain actions to be performed.

```tsx filename="app/page.[jsx/tsx]"
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs';

export default async function Page() {
  const { orgRole } = auth();
  return (
    <>
      <div>Your current role is {orgRole}</div>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Return type of `auth`

`auth` returns the [`Authentication`](/docs/references/nextjs/authentication-object) object with a few extra properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `protect` | Function | Accepts a permission or a role key or a function with `has` as the first parameter. It will throw a `notFound` Next.js error if the user is unauthorized. Otherwise, it returns an `Authentication` object. |
| `redirectToSignIn` | Function | Redirects the user to the sign in page. |
