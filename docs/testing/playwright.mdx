title: Testing with Playwright
description: Use Playwright to write end-to-end tests with Clerk.
---

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev) is an open-source, end-to-end testing framework that automates web application testing across multiple browsers. This guide will help you set up your environment for creating authenticated tests with Clerk, assuming you have some familiarity with both Clerk and Playwright.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check out the [demo repo](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-playwright-nextjs) that demonstrates testing a Clerk-powered application using [Testing Tokens](/docs/testing/overview#testing-tokens). To run the tests, you'll need dev instance keys, a test user with username and password, and have username and password authentication enabled in the Clerk Dashboard.

<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/testing`

  Clerk's testing package provides integration helpers for popular testing frameworks. Install it by running the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
    ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm i @clerk/testing --save-dev
    ```

    ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add -D @clerk/testing
    ```

    ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/testing -D
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your API keys

  In your test runner, set your publishable and secret key as the `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variables, respectively.

  To find your keys:

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
  1. In the top navbar, select **Configure**. In the sidebar, select **API Keys**.
  1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.

  > [!WARNING]
  > Ensure that the secret key is provided securely to prevent exposure to third parties. For example, if you are using GitHub Actions, refer to [_Using secrets in GitHub Actions_](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

  ### Configure Playwright with Clerk

  The `clerkSetup()` function obtains a Testing Token when your test suite starts, making it available for all subsequent tests to use. This ensures that you don't have to manually generate a Testing Token for each test.

  To configure Playwright with Clerk, call the `clerkSetup()` function in your [global setup file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-global-setup-teardown), as shown in the following example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'global.setup.ts' }}
  import { clerkSetup } from '@clerk/testing/playwright'
  import { test as setup } from '@playwright/test'

  setup('global setup', async ({}) => {
    await clerkSetup()
  })
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can manually set the Testing Token by using the `CLERK_TESTING_TOKEN` environment variable instead of calling `clerkSetup()`.

  ### Use `setupClerkTestingToken()`

  Now that Playwright is configured with Clerk, you can use the `setupClerkTestingToken()` function to include the Testing Token in individual test cases. This function injects the Testing Token for the specific test, ensuring the test can bypass Clerk's bot detection mechanisms. See the following example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'my-test.spec.ts' }}
  import { setupClerkTestingToken } from '@clerk/testing/playwright'
  import { test } from '@playwright/test'

  test('sign up', async ({ page }) => {
    await setupClerkTestingToken({ page })

    await page.goto('/sign-up')
    // Add additional test logic here
  })
  ```
</Steps>

## Test Helpers

The `@clerk/testing` package also provides some helper functions to sign in/sign out with Clerk in your Playwright tests without having to interact with the UI.
To use these commands, import the `clerk` object from the `@clerk/testing/playwright` package.

### `clerk.signIn()`

The `clerk.signIn()` function is used to sign in a user using Clerk. This helper only supports the following first factor strategies: password, phone code, and email code. Multi-factor authentication is not supported.

Before calling `clerk.signIn()`, it is required to call `page.goto()` and navigate to an unprotected page that loads Clerk. For example, the index (`/`) page.

> [!NOTE]
> `clerk.signIn()` internally uses the `setupClerkTestingToken()` helper, so you don't need to call it separately.

#### Parameters

`clerk.signIn()` accepts an object with the following properties:

<Properties>
  - `page`
  - [`Page`](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom)

  [The Playwright `Page` object](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom) to use for the sign-in operation.

  ---

  - `signInParams`
  - [`ClerkSignInParams`](#clerk-sign-in-params)

  The parameters to use for the sign-in operation. See [`ClerkSignInParams`](#clerk-sign-in-params).

  ---

  - `setupClerkTestingTokenOptions?`
  - [`SetupClerkTestingTokenOptions`](#set-up-clerk-testing-token-options)

  Options to pass to `setupClerkTestingToken()`. See [`SetupClerkTestingTokenOptions`](#set-up-clerk-testing-token-options).
</Properties>

#### `ClerkSignInParams`

The `ClerkSignInParams` type is used to define the object that is passed to the `signInParams` parameter of the `clerk.signIn()` function. It has the following properties:

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'password' | 'phone_code' | 'email_code'`

  The sign-in strategy. Supported strategies are:

  - `password`: The command will sign in the user using the provided password and identifier.
  - `phone_code`: You must have a user with a test phone number as an identifier (e.g., `+15555550100`).
  - `email_code`: You must have a user with a test email as an identifier (e.g., `your_email+clerk_test@example.com`).

  ---

  - `identifier`
  - `string`

  The user's identifier. This could be a username, a phone number, or an email.

  ---

  - `password`
  - `string`

  The user's password. This is required only if the `strategy` is set to `'password'`.
</Properties>

#### `SetupClerkTestingTokenOptions`

The `SetupClerkTestingTokenOptions` type is used to define the object that is passed to the `setupClerkTestingTokenOptions` parameter of the `clerk.signIn()` function. It has the following properties:

<Properties>
  - `frontendApiUrl?`
  - `string`

  The frontend API URL for your Clerk dev instance, without the protocol. If provided, it overrides the Frontend API URL parsed from the publishable key. It can be found in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) under **API Keys > Show API URLs**. For example, `'relieved-chamois-66.clerk.accounts.dev'`.
</Properties>

  // Navigate to an unprotected page that loads Clerk
  await page.goto('/')

  await clerk.signIn({
    page,
    signInParams: { strategy: 'phone_code', identifier: '+15555550100' },
  })

  // Navigate to a protected page
  await page.goto('/protected')
})
```

### `clerk.signOut()`

import { clerk } from '@clerk/testing/playwright'

test('sign out', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to an unprotected page that loads Clerk
  await page.goto('/')

  await clerk.signIn({
    page,
    signInParams: { strategy: 'phone_code', identifier: '+15555550100' },
  })

  await page.goto('/protected')
  await clerk.signOut({ page })
  await page.goto('/protected')
  // should redirect to sign in page
})
```

### `clerk.loaded()`

`clerk.loaded()` asserts that Clerk has been loaded.

Before calling `clerk.loaded()`, it is required to call `page.goto()` and navigate to an unprotected page that loads Clerk. For example, the index (`/`) page.
