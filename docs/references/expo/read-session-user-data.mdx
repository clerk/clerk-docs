# Read session and user data with Expo

Clerk provides a set of React hooks and helpers that you can use to access active session and user data in your Expo application. The examples in this guide will demonstrate how to use some of these helpers.

See [the React Client-side Helpers reference guides](/docs/references/react/use-user) for more information.

## Session data example

[`useAuth()`](/docs/references/react/use-auth) gives you access to the current auth state. This hook provides the minimal information needed for data-loading and helper methods to manage the current active session.

The following example demonstrates how to use `useAuth()` to get and display session and user data:

```tsx {{ filename: 'components/UseAuthExample.tsx' }}
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'
import { Text } from 'react-native'

export default function UseAuthExample() {
  const { isLoaded, userId, sessionId } = useAuth()

  // In case the user signs out while on the page.
  if (!isLoaded || !userId) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <Text>
      Hello, {userId} your current active session is {sessionId}
    </Text>
  )
}
```

## User data example

[`useUser()`](/docs/references/react/use-user) enables you to access the current user's data and provides helper methods to manage the current active session.

The following example demonstrates how to use `useUser()` to check if the user is signed in and display their first name.

```tsx {{ filename: 'component/UseUserExample.tsx' }}
import { useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'
import { Text } from 'react-native'

export default function UseUserExample() {
  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser()

  if (!isLoaded || !isSignedIn) {
    return null
  }

  return <Text>Hello, {user.firstName} welcome to Clerk</Text>
}
```
