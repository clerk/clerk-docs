</Properties>

## Methods

### `create()`

Creates a new `SignUp` instance initialized with the provided parameters. The instance maintains the sign-up lifecycle state through its `status` property, which updates as the authentication flow progresses. Will also deactivate any existing sign-up process the client may already have in progress.

What you must pass to `params` depends on which [sign-up options](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options) you have enabled in your app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard.

You can complete the sign-up process in one step if you supply the required fields to `create()`. Otherwise, Clerk's sign-up process provides great flexibility and allows users to easily create multi-step sign-up flows.

> [!WARNING] > Once the sign-up process is complete, call the `signUp.finalize()` method to set the newly created session as > the active session.

```ts
function create(params: SignUpFutureCreateParams): Promise<{ error: unknown }>
```
