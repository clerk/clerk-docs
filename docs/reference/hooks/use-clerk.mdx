> [!WARNING]
> This hook should only be used for advanced use cases, such as building a completely custom OAuth flow or as an escape hatch to access to the `Clerk` object.

The `useClerk()` hook provides access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk) object, allowing you to build alternatives to any Clerk Component.

## Returns

The `useClerk()` hook returns the `Clerk` object, which includes all the methods and properties listed in the [`Clerk` reference](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk).

## Example

The following example uses the `useClerk()` hook to access the `clerk` object. The `clerk` object is used to call the [`openSignIn()`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#sign-in) method to open the sign-in modal.

<If sdk="react">
  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/Home.tsx' }}
  import { useClerk } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

  export default function Home() {
    const clerk = useClerk()

    return <button onClick={() => clerk.openSignIn({})}>Sign in</button>
  }
  ```
</If>

<If sdk="nextjs">
  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
  'use client'

  import { useClerk } from '@clerk/nextjs'

  export default function HomePage() {
    const clerk = useClerk()

    return <button onClick={() => clerk.openSignIn({})}>Sign in</button>
  }
  ```
</If>
