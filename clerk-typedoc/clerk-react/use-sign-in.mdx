The `useSignIn()` hook provides access to the [`SignIn`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-in) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-in attempt and manage the sign-in flow. You can use this to create a [custom sign-in flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview#sign-in-flow).

## Returns

There are multiple variants of this type available which you can select by clicking on one of the tabs.

<Tabs items={['Initialization', 'Loaded']}>
<Tab>
| Name | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `isLoaded` | `false` | A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads. |
| `setActive` | `undefined` | A function that sets the active session. See the [reference doc](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#set-active). |
| `signIn` | `undefined` | An object that contains the current sign-in attempt status and methods to create a new sign-in attempt. |
</Tab>

| Name | Type | Description |

| `setActive()` | <code>(setActiveParams: [SetActiveParams](../types/set-active-params.mdx)) => Promise\<void\></code> | A function that sets the active session. See the [reference doc](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#set-active). |
| `signIn` | [`SignInResource`](../types/sign-in-resource.mdx) | An object that contains the current sign-in attempt status and methods to create a new sign-in attempt. |

## Examples

### Check the current state of a sign-in

The following example uses the `useSignIn()` hook to access the [`SignIn`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-in) object, which contains the current sign-in attempt status and methods to create a new sign-in attempt. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state.

<Tabs items={['React', 'Next.js']}>
<Tab>

```tsx {{ filename: 'src/pages/SignInPage.tsx' }}
import { useSignIn } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export default function SignInPage() {
  const { isLoaded, signIn } = useSignIn();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  return <div>The current sign-in attempt status is {signIn?.status}.</div>;
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-in/page.tsx' }}
"use client";

import { useSignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function SignInPage() {
  const { isLoaded, signIn } = useSignIn();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  return <div>The current sign-in attempt status is {signIn?.status}.</div>;
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Create a custom sign-in flow with `useSignIn()`

The `useSignIn()` hook can also be used to build fully custom sign-in flows, if Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow. Different sign-in flows include email and password, email and phone codes, email links, and multifactor (MFA). To learn more about using the `useSignIn()` hook to create custom flows, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview).
