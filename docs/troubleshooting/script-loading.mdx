# Script loading

It sometimes might happen that Clerk doesn't successfully load and initialize during page rendering. This could happen for a myriad of reasons, including but not limited to:

- You have no internet connection
- The CDN which is used for the [ClerkJS script](/docs/references/javascript/overview#install-clerk-js-as-script) is offline or blocked
- Another script is colliding with Clerk
- Missing or invalid Publishable key

Check your internet access and that e.g. no Ad-Blocker is blocking Clerk's scripts.

If Clerk stops working after you've added another script (e.g. through a React component), you can try delaying the loading of that other script. For example, to only mount `@monaco-editor/react` after Clerk loaded you can use the [`useClerk()` hook](/docs/references/react/use-clerk#use-clerk):

```jsx {{ prettier: false }}
import { Editor } from "@monaco-editor/react";
import { useClerk } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Home() {
  const clerk = useClerk()
  
  return (
    <main>
      {clerk.loaded && <Editor />}
    </main>
  );
}
```
