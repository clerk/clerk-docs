# Integrate Convex with Clerk

In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [JWT Templates](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=jwt-templates)page. Select the **New template** button to create a new template based on Convex.

  alt="The JWT Templates page in the Clerk Dashboard. The 'New template' button was clicked, and a pop up titled 'New JWT template' is shown. The 'Convex' template is hovered over."
/>

Once the Convex template is created, you will be redirected to the template's page. You can now configure the template to your needs.

/>

The Convex template will pre-populate the default audience (`aud`) claim required by Convex. You can include additional claims as necessary. [Shortcodes](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates#shortcodes) are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.

By default, Clerk will sign the JWT with a private key automatically generated for your application, which is what most developers use for Convex. If you so choose, you can customize this key.

## Configure Convex

The next step is to configure Convex with the issuer domain provided by Clerk. From your Clerk **JWT template** screen, find the **Issuer** input and click to **Copy** the URL.

  src="/docs/images/integrations/convex/template-issuer.webp"
  alt="The 'Create new template' page of the JWT Templates page in the Clerk Dashboard. There is a red box surrounding the 'Issuer' section."
/>

In your terminal, run the following command from your Convex app directory:

```sh filename="terminal"
npx convex auth add
```

Paste the **Issuer** URL you copied when it prompts you for the identity provider's URL.

The application/client ID will need to match the `aud` claim (default is `convex`).

```sh
? Enter the identity providers Domain URL: https://your-issuer-url.clerk.accounts.dev/
? Enter your application/client ID with this identity provider: convex
? Would you like to add another provider? No
? Configuration updated. Run npx convex dev or npx convex deploy to sync these changes.
```

## Configure the providers

Both Clerk and Convex have Provider components that are required to wrap your React application to provide the authentication and client context.

```jsx
import "../styles/globals.css";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { ClerkProvider, useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { ConvexProvider, ConvexReactClient } from "convex/react";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL);

function ClerkConvexAdapter() {
  const { getToken, isSignedIn } = useAuth();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isSignedIn) {
      convex.setAuth(async () =>
        getToken({ template: "convex", skipCache: true })
      );
    } else {
      convex.clearAuth();
    }
  }, [getToken, isSignedIn]);
  return null;
}

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider
      publishableKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
    >
      <ConvexProvider client={convex}>
        <ClerkConvexAdapter />
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </ConvexProvider>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
```

## Access user identity

In some cases, you may need to access the user when using Convex queries and mutations. You can use the `getUserIdentity()` method provided on the `auth` property, which is passed to the context argument of every Convex function invocation.

```ts filename="convex/getUser.ts"
import type { UserIdentity } from 'convex/server';
import { query } from './_generated/server';

export default query(async ({ auth }): Promise<UserIdentity | null> => {
  const identity = await auth.getUserIdentity();

  return identity;
});
```

The identity object should be match the [openID spec](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims), you can update the JWT template to include them for example:

```sh
{
  "email": "{{user.primary_email_address}}",
  "picture": "{{user.profile_image_url}}",
  "given_name": "{{user.first_name}}",
  "family_name": "{{user.last_name}}",
  "email_verified": "{{user.email_verified}}"
}
```
