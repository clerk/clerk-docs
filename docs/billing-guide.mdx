This guide will walk you through setting up your application to use Clerk Billing.

## Enabling Billing

To start using Clerk Billing, you’ll first need to enable it on your application. You can do this from Clerk’s dashboard.

The first step is to log into your Clerk account, and select the application you want to enable Billing on. From there you can click on the **Configure** tab in the top page navigation. Then click on the **Settings** tab found in the side navigation under the **Billing** section.

This page will guide you through enabling Billing on your application. If you’ve created a new application, after the Billing launch, there will only be one step you need to complete: Create a Plan.

If you want to enable Billing on an app that predates the Billing launch, there may be a couple more steps to get up and going. You can follow the helpful onboarding cards to make any updates to your application needed. Once you’ve completed all those cards, you’ll be able to Enable Billing on your application.

## Creating a Plan

Creating a Plan is easy. You can create any number of Plans you’d like. If you’re using Organizations, you can create dedicated Organization Plans that will only be available to Organizations. Only organizations can subscribe to these Plans.

Similarly, User Plans are only available to users. Only users can subscribe to these Plans.

You can hide Plans from appearing on the Clerk UI Components (like `<PricingTable />`, `<UserProfile />`, and `<OrganizationProfile />`) by toggling off the “Visible on Components” option when creating and editing a Plan.

## Adding Features to a Plan

Features make it easy to give entitlements to your Plans. You can add any number of Features to a Plan. Then, you can check to see if a user (or organization) has access to those Features from your app’s codebase. Features make it easy to gate access to your app’s content and functionality.

When you add a Feature to a Plan, it will also automatically appear in the corresponding Plan Tier in the  `<PricingTable />` component.

You can hide Features from appearing on the `<PricingTable />` component by toggling off the “Visible on Components” option when creating and editing a Feature.

### Using Features and Plans in your app

You can gate access to the content in your app using Clerk’s Features and Plans. Clerk provides a couple of ways to do this. The simplest way is via our [`has()`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#has) method and our [`<Protect />`](https://clerk.com/docs/components/protect) component.

Examples using [`has()`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#has):

import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

```js
export default async function Page() {
  const { has } = await auth()

  const hasPremiumAccess = has({ feature: 'premium_access' })

  if (!hasPremiumAccess) return null

  return <h1>Our Exclusive Content</h1>
}
```

```js
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default async function Page() {
  const { has } = await auth()

  const hasBronzePlan = has({ plan: 'bronze' })

  if (!hasBronzePlan) return null

  return <h1>For Bronze subscribers only</h1>
}
```

Examples using [`<Protect />`](https://clerk.com/docs/components/protect):

```js
import { Protect } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function ProtectPage() {
  return (
    <Protect
      feature="premium_access"
      fallback={<p>Only subscribers with the Premium Access feature can access this content.</p>}
    >
      {children}
    </Protect>
  )
}
```

```js
import { Protect } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function ProtectPage() {
  return (
    <Protect
      plan="bronze"
      fallback={<p>Only subscribers to the Bronze plan can access this content.</p>}
    >
      {children}
    </Protect>
  )
}
```
