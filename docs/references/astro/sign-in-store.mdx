# `$signInStore`

The `$signInStore` store provides a convenient way to access the [`SignIn`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-in. This is also useful for creating a custom sign-in flow.

## How to use the `$signInStore` store

### Check the current state of a sign-in

The following example demonstrates how to use the `$signInStore` store to check the current state of a sign-in.

```tsx {{ filename: 'sign-in-step.tsx' }}
import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react';
import { $signInStore } from '@clerk/astro/client';

export default function SignInStep() {
  const signIn = useStore($signInStore);

  if (signIn === undefined) {
    // Add logic to handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  // Logic to handle sign in

  return <div>The current sign in attempt status is {signIn.status}.</div>;
}
```

The possible values for the `status` property of the `SignIn` resource are listed [here](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in#properties).

### Create a custom sign-in flow

The `$signInStore` store can also be used to build fully custom sign-in flows, if Clerk's pre-built components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow. Different sign-in flows include email and password, email and phone codes, email links, and multifactor (MFA). To learn more about using the `$signInStore` store to create custom flows, check out the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).
