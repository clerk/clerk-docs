# Handle navigation

These are all methods on [the Clerk class](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) that help you handle navigation callbacks from Clerk, usually in conjunction with [redirect methods](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/redirect-methods) or [built URLs](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/build-urls).

## `handleEmailLinkVerification()`

Completes an email link verification flow once we've reached the email link results URL.

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function handleEmailLinkVerification(
    params: handleEmailLinkVerificationParams,
    customNavigate?: ((to: string) => Promise<unknown>) | undefined
): Promise<unknown>;
```

When users click on email links they get redirected to the URL that was provided during email link verification flow initialization. The URL will contain a couple of important query parameters added by Clerk. These are called `__clerk_status` and `__clerk_created_session`.

The `__clerk_status` query parameter is the outcome of the verification and accepts the following values: `verified`, `failed`, `expired`, or `client_mismatch`. `client_mismatch` can only be a verification outcome if the [**Require the same device or browser**](/docs/security/email-link-protection) setting is turned on for sign-ins and sign-ups.

The `__clerk_created_session` query parameter will hold the ID of the new session, if one was created as a result of the verification. Since the email link can be opened at any device and not the one that originated the verification, the new session ID might not be available under [Client.sessions](/docs/references/javascript/client#properties).

Email link flows can be completed on the same device that they were initiated or on a completely different browser. For example, a user might start the email link flow on their desktop browser, but click on the email link from their mobile phone.

The `handleEmailLinkVerification()` method takes care of finalizing the email link flow, depending on the verification outcome.

Upon successful verification, the method will figure out if the sign in or sign up attempt was completed and redirect the user accordingly. As such, it accepts different parameters for the URL it should redirect when sign-in or sign-up is completed and the URL which it should redirect when the sign-in or sign-up attempt is still pending. Both parameters are optional, but you can provide them to the method up front. The final redirect will depend on the sign-in or sign-up attempt's status.

If the email link verification failed or the link expired, this method will throw a [`EmailLinkError`](/docs/custom-flows/email-links). Check the error's `code` property for details.

Additionally, the `handleEmailLinkVerification()` method allows you to execute a callback if the successful verification happened on another device.

In case the email link verification wasn't successful, the `handleEmailLinkVerification()` method will throw a [`EmailLinkError`](/docs/custom-flows/email-links). You can check the error's `code` property to see if the email link expired, or the verification simply failed.

Take a look at the function parameters description below for more usage details.

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `params` | [`handleEmailLinkVerificationParams`](#handle-email-link-verification-params) | Allows you to define the URLs where the user should be redirected to on successful verification and: <ul><li>Completed sign in or sign up attempt.</li><li>Pending sign in or sign up attempt.</li></ul><br />If the email link is successfully verified on another device, there's a callback function parameter that allows custom code execution. |
| `customNavigate?` | `(to: string) => Promise<unknown>` | Allows you to define a custom navigation function. |

### `handleEmailLinkVerificationParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `redirectUrlComplete?` | `string \| undefined` | Full URL or path to navigate after successful email link verification on completed sign up or sign in on the same device. |

## `handleRedirectCallback()`

Completes a custom OAuth flow started by calling either [`SignIn.authenticateWithRedirect(params)`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) or [`SignUp.authenticateWithRedirect(params)`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up).

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function handleRedirectCallback(
    params: HandleOAuthCallbackParams,
    customNavigate?: ((to: string) => Promise<unknown>) | undefined
): Promise<unknown>;
```

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `params` | [`HandleOAuthCallbackParams`](#handle-o-auth-callback-params) | Additional props that define where the user will be redirected to at the end of a successful OAuth flow. |
| `customNavigate` | `(to: string) => Promise<unknown>` | Allows you to define a custom navigation function. |

### `HandleOAuthCallbackParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |

| `signUpUrl?` | `string` | Full URL or path where the SignUp component is mounted. |
| `signInFallbackRedirectUrl?` | `string` | The fallback URL to redirect to after the user signs in, if there's no `redirect_url` in the path already. Defaults to `/`.

| `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl?` | `string` | The fallback URL to redirect to after the user signs up, if there's no `redirect_url` in the path already. Defaults to `/`. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead. |
| `signInForceRedirectUrl?` | `string` | If provided, this URL will always be redirected to after the user signs in. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead. |
| `signUpForceRedirectUrl?` | `string` | If provided, this URL will always be redirected to after the user signs up. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead. |
| `firstFactorUrl` | `string \| undefined` | Full URL or path to navigate during sign in, if identifier verification is required. |
| `secondFactorUrl` | `string \| undefined` | Full URL or path to navigate during sign in, if 2FA is enabled. |
