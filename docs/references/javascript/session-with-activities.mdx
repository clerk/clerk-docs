# `SessionWithActivities`

The `SessionWithActivities` object is a modified [`Session`][session-ref] object. It contains most of the information that the [`Session`][session-ref] object stores, adding extra information about the current session's latest activity.

The additional data included in the latest activity are useful for analytics purposes. A [`SessionActivity`](#session-activity) object will provide information about the user's location, device and browser.

While the `SessionWithActivities` object wraps the most important information around a [`Session`][session-ref] object, the two objects have entirely different methods.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | A unique identifier for the session. |
| `status` | [`SessionStatus`](/docs/references/javascript/types/session-status) | The current state of the session. |
| `lastActiveAt` | `Date` | The time the session was last active on the [`Client`][client-ref]. |
| `abandonAt` | `Date` | The time when the session was abandoned by the user. |
| `expireAt` | `Date` | The time the session expires and will seize to be active. |
| `latestActivity` | [`SessionActivity`](#session-activity) | An object that provides additional information about this session, focused around user activity data. |

## Methods

### `revoke()`

Marks this session as revoked. If this is the active session, the attempt to revoke it will fail.

Users can revoke only their own sessions.

```typescript
function revoke(): Promise<SessionWithActivities>;
```
