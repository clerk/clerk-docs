These methods on the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) class help you manage the active session and/or organization.

## `setActive()`

A method used to set the active session and/or organization. Accepts a [`SetActiveParams`](/docs/references/javascript/types/set-active-params) object.

```typescript
function setActive(params: SetActiveParams): Promise<void>
```

### Example

The `setActive()` method is most commonly used when building a [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview) for your application.

For example, during authentication, when a user signs in or signs up successfully, a new session is created. `setActive()` needs to be used to set the new session as the active session. See the implementation of this in the [Custom authentication flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview) guide.

Another example is when a user switches organizations in a multi-organization application. `setActive()` needs to be used to set the new organization as the active organization. See the implementation of this in the [Custom organization switcher](/docs/organizations/custom-organization-switcher) guide.
