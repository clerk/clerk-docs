How to set up social connection with Twitter v1

## Overview

Adding social connection with Twitter to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

Clerk does not currently support preconfigured shared OAuth credentials for Twitter on development instances. You will have to provide custom credentials for both development *and* production instances, which includes generating your own Client ID and Client Secret using your Twitter Developer account. Don't worry, this guide will walk you through that process in just a few simple steps.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Twitter account and a Twitter OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Twitter Application set up so it can be used for Social connection. If you don't have a Twitter Application, click [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps/overview) for instructions on how to create one. If you already have one, please go to your [Twitter app settings](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps) and ensure that the *"Allow this app to be used to Sign in with Twitter?*” option is enabled.

## Configuring Twitter social connection

If you don't have an existing Twitter Application you've set up for social connection, you need to register a new one at the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). Note that the process requires approval from Twitter before your new application can be used.

To do so, go to "[Projects & Apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps)" and click "**+ Add App**" to create a new application. After entering a name, you'll be presented with your app's credentials: **API Key** and **API Secret**. Copy those values as you will be needing those shortly.

> You will need your application to be approved for elevated status to be able to use it with Clerk. You can apply for the status in [Twitter developer dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/elevated)

In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)** and enable Twitter. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and paste the **API Key** and **API Secret** values which you copied in the previous step. Then, copy the **Authorized redirect URI**.

Navigate to your application settings screen and scroll down to the **User authentication settings** section and click **Set up**.

In the next screen you'll be presented with the user authentication settings. Make sure that both **OAuth 1.0a** and **Request email address from users** are enabled.

Also, enter the **Authorized Redirect URI** that you grabbed in the previous step from your Clerk instance's settings and insert it in the **Callback URI** setting. Your app's settings should like similar to the ones below.  Fill any other required fields and click save. Your Twitter App is now ready.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with Twitter is now configured for your instance.
