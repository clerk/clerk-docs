## Methods

### `createBackupCode()`

Generates a fresh new set of backup codes for the user. Every time the method is called, it will replace the previously generated backup codes. Returns a [`BackupCodeResource`][backupcode-ref] object.

> [!WARNING]
> Can only be created for the user if the user has _another_ multi-factor authentication method enabled for their account, in the Clerk Dashboard, as backup codes are a fallback for when the user is unable to use their primary MFA method.

```typescript
function createBackupCode(): Promise<BackupCodeResource>
```

#### Example

```js
await clerk.user.createBackupCode()
```

### `createEmailAddress()`

Adds an email address for the user. A new [`EmailAddress`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/email-address) will be created and associated with the user.

> [!WARNING]
> [**Email** must be enabled](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options#email) in your app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard.

```ts
function createEmailAddress(params: CreateEmailAddressParams): Promise<EmailAddress>
```

#### `CreateEmailAddressParams`

<Properties>
  - `email`
  - `string`

  The email address to be added to the user.
</Properties>

#### Example

```js
await clerk.user.createEmailAddress({ email: 'test@test.com' })
```

### `createExternalAccount()`

Adds an external account for the user. A new [`ExternalAccount`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/external-account) will be created and associated with the user. This method is useful if you want to allow an already signed-in user to connect their account with an external provider, such as Facebook, GitHub, etc., so that they can sign in with that provider in the future.

> [!WARNING]
> The social provider that you want to connect to [must be enabled](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options#sso-connections) in your app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard.

```ts
function createExternalAccount(params: CreateExternalAccountParams): Promise<ExternalAccount>
```

#### `CreateExternalAccountParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - [`OAuthStrategy`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sso#o-auth-strategy)

  The strategy corresponding to the OAuth provider. For example: `'oauth_facebook'`, `'oauth_github'`, etc.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The full URL or path that the OAuth provider should redirect to, on successful authorization on their part. Typically, this will be a simple `/sso-callback` route that calls [`Clerk.handleRedirectCallback`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#handle-redirect-callback) or mounts the [`<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />`](/docs/reference/components/control/authenticate-with-redirect-callback) component. See the [custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/oauth-connections) for implementation details.

  ---

  - `additionalScopes?`
  - `string[]`

  Additional scopes for your user to be prompted to approve.

  ---

  - `oidcPrompt?`
  - `string`

  The value to pass to the [OIDC `prompt` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=prompt,reauthentication%20and%20consent.) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.

  ---

  - `oidcLoginHint?`
  - `string`

  The value to pass to the [OIDC `login_hint` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=login_hint,in%20\(if%20necessary\).) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.
</Properties>

#### Example

After calling `createExternalAccount`, the initial `state` of the returned `ExternalAccount` will be `unverified`. To initiate the connection with the external provider, redirect the user to the `externalAccount.verification.externalVerificationRedirectURL` contained in the result of `createExternalAccount`.

Upon return, inspect within the `user.externalAccounts` the entry that corresponds to the requested strategy:

- If the connection succeeded, then `externalAccount.verification.status` will be `verified`.
- If the connection failed, then the `externalAccount.verification.status` will not be `verified` and the `externalAccount.verification.error` will contain the error encountered, which you can present to the user. To learn more about the properties available on `verification`, see the [`verification`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/verification) reference.

The following example demonstrates how to add a Notion account as an external account for the user. When the user selects the "Add Notion as a social connection" button, the user will be redirected to Notion to connect their account. After connecting their account, they will be redirected to the `/` route of your application, and the status of the connection will be displayed.

> [!WARNING]
> The **Authenticator application** multi-factor strategy must be enabled in your app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard. See the [Multi-factor authentication](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options#multi-factor-authentication) section to learn more.

```

### `update()`

Updates the user's attributes. Use this method to save information you collected about the user.

The appropriate settings must be enabled in the Clerk Dashboard for the user to be able to update their attributes. For example, if you want to use the `update({ firstName })` method, you must enable the **First and last name** setting. It can be found on the [**User & authentication**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/user-and-authentication) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

  ---

  - `unsafeMetadata`

  Metadata that can be read and set from the Frontend API. One common use case for this attribute is to implement custom fields that will be attached to the `User` object. Updating this value overrides the previous value; it does not merge. To perform a merge, you can pass something like `{ …user.unsafeMetadata, …newData }` to this parameter.
</Properties>

#### Example

```js
await clerk.user.update({ firstName: 'Test' })
```

function verifyTOTP(params: VerifyTOTPParams): Promise<TOTPResource>
```
