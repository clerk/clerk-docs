  - Use a custom OIDC provider to authenticate users with Enterprise SSO
</TutorialHero>

This guide explains how to use a custom OIDC provider to authenticate users via Enterprise SSO.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your Identity Provider (IdP).

<Steps>
  ### Set up an enterprise connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For specific domains**.
  1. Under **Third party**, select **OIDC**.
  1. Add the **Name** of the connection.
  1. Add the **Key** of the provider. This is the provider's unique identifier (cannot be changed after creation).
  1. Add the **Specific Domain** that you want to allow this connection for. This is the domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your application.
  1. Select **Add connection**. You will be redirected to the connection's configuration page.

  The next steps involve configuring both your Identity Provider (IdP) and Clerk. Keep both dashboards open as you'll need to reference them.

  ### Configure your Identity Provider (IdP)

  1. If necessary, create a new app in your IdP.
  1. In the connection's configuration page in the Clerk Dashboard, copy the **Authorized redirect URI**.
  1. Add the value to your IdP's whitelisted URLs.

  ### Set the Discovery Endpoint, Client ID, and Client Secret in Clerk

  1. In your IdP settings, copy your application's **Discovery Endpoint**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**.
  1. In the connection's configuration page in the Clerk Dashboard, paste these values in their respective fields.
  1. Add the minimum required scopes based on the IdP's documentation. Common OIDC scopes include `openid`, `email`, and `profile`.
  1. Select **Save**.

  ### Configure attribute mapping (optional)

  If your provider returns claims in a non-standard format, use the **Attribute Mapping** section on the connection's configuration page to adjust the mapping of Clerk's user properties to match the IdP's claim attributes.

  > [!CAUTION]
  > OIDC Enterprise connections require the `email_verified` claim to verify email ownership. If the IdP doesn't return this claim, you can set its default value of `true`. However, ensure you fully trust the IdP to prevent exploits like [nOAuth](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth).

  ### Enable the connection for Clerk

  To make the connection available for your users to authenticate with:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select the OIDC connection.
  1. Toggle on **Enable connection**.
  1. Select **Save**.
