Clerk supports modeling your own custom role and permissions to control access to resources within your application when you use [organizations](/docs/organizations/overview).

## Roles

Roles determine a user's level of access to the organization. You can extend a role's privileges and access to resources by adding [permissions](#permissions).

### Default roles

For each instance, there are currently two default roles:

- **Admin (`org:admin`)** - Offers full access to organization resources. Members with the admin role have all the [System Permissions](#system-permissions). They can fully manage the organization and organization memberships.
- **Member (`org:member`)** - Offers limited access to organization resources. Access to organization resources is limited to the "Read members" permission only, by default. They cannot manage the organization and organization memberships, but they can view information about other members in it.

> [!NOTE]
> If you enabled organizations for your application before December 2023, the **Admin** role is `admin` and the **Member** role is `basic_member`, instead of `org:admin` and `org:member`, respectively.

### The **Creator** role

When a user creates a new organization, they're automatically added as its first member and assigned the organization's designated **Creator** role. By default, that role is `org:admin`.

You cannot delete an organization role if it's used as the organization's **Creator** role. But, you _can_ reassign the **Creator** role to any other role with the right permissions. For example, if you want to delete the `admin` role, you will have to assign another role as the **Creator** role.

The **Creator** role must _at least_ have the following [System Permissions](#system-permissions):

- Manage members (`org:sys_memberships:manage`)
- Read members (`org:sys_memberships:read`)
- Delete organization (`org:sys_profile:delete`)

To reassign the **Creator** role:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to [**Roles**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings/roles).
1. [Create a new role](#custom-roles) or use an existing role from the list.
1. Ensure that **Manage members**, **Read members**, and **Delete organization** system permissions are selected for the role.
1. Open the three dots icon for the role.
1. From the dropdown, select the **Set as Creator role** option.

### The **Default** role for members

New organization members are initially assigned the **Default** role. By default, that role is `org:member`. This role is used as a pre-filled default in `<OrganizationProfile />` invitations and for organization enrollment with [verified domains](/docs/organizations/verified-domains).

You cannot delete an organization role if it's used as the organization's **Default** role. But, you _can_ reassign the **Default** role to any other role.

To reassign the **Default** role:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to [**Roles**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings/roles).
1. [Create a new role](#custom-roles) or use an existing role from the list.
1. Open the three dots icon for the role.
1. From the dropdown, select the **Set as Default role** option.

### Custom roles

> [!WARNING]
> Custom roles require a [paid plan](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} and the Enhanced B2B SaaS Add-on for production use, but free to use in development mode so that you can try out what works for you. See the [pricing](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} page for more information.

You can create up to 10 custom organization roles per application instance to meet your application needs. If you need more than 10 roles, [contact support](/contact/support){{ target: '_blank' }}.

Custom roles can be granted permissions and access. For example, you can create a new role of **Billing** (`org:billing`) which can be used to group users who belong to a specific department of the organization and have permission to manage credit card information, invoices, and other resources related to billing.

To create a new role:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to [**Roles**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings/roles)
1. Select **Create new role**.
1. Give the role a name, a key to reference it by in the format `org:<role>`, and a description.
1. Select **Create role**.

### Change a user's role

You can change a user's role in the Clerk Dashboard, or in your application, such as in the [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/components/organization/organization-switcher) component.

To change a user's role in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the top in the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Organizations**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations) and select an organization.
1. Select the **Members** tab.
1. In the list of members, find the one whose role you want to change.
1. Select another role from their role dropdown.

### Delete a role

You cannot delete a role that is still assigned to members of an organization. Change the members to a different role before completing the following steps.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to [**Roles**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings/roles).
1. Select the three dots icon next to the role.
1. Select **Delete role**.

## Permissions

Permissions grant users privileged access to resources and operations, like creating and deleting. Clerk supports two types of permissions: System and Custom.

### System permissions

Clerk provides a set of system permissions that power [Clerk's Frontend API](/docs/reference/frontend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} and [organization-related Clerk components](/docs/components/overview). These permissions serve as the baseline required for Clerk to operate effectively.

Clerk's system permissions consist of the following:

- Manage organization (`org:sys_profile:manage`)
- Delete organization (`org:sys_profile:delete`)
- Read members (`org:sys_memberships:read`)
- Manage members (`org:sys_memberships:manage`)
- Read domains (`org:sys_domains:read`)
- Manage domains (`org:sys_domains:manage`)
- Read billing (`org:sys_billing:read`)
- Manage billing (`org:sys_billing:manage`)

You can assign these system permissions to any role.

> [!WARNING]
> System permissions aren't included in [session claims](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens#default-claims). To check permissions on the server-side, you must [create custom permissions](#custom-permissions).

### Custom permissions

> [!WARNING]
> Custom permissions require a [paid plan](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} and the Enhanced B2B SaaS Add-on for production use, but free to use in development mode so that you can try out what works for you. See the [pricing](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} page for more information.

When creating a new permission, follow the format `org:<feature>:<permission>`. You can then assign the permission to an existing role.

For example, you could create a new permission called **Create invoices** (`org:invoices:create`) which allows only users with this permission to edit invoices. Then, you could assign this permission to a role, or multiple roles, such as **Billing** (`org:billing`) or **Sales** (`org:sales`).

To create a new permission:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to [**Permissions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings/permissions).
1. Select **Create new permission**.
1. Give the permission a name, a key to reference it by in the format `org:<feature>:<permission>`, and a description.
   > [!NOTE]
   > Common permission values could be:
   >
   > - `create` — to allow creating resources
   > - `read` — to allow reading/viewing resources
   > - `update/manage` — to allow updating/editing resources
   > - `delete` — to allow deleting resources
   >
   > For example, you could create a new permission called **Create invoices** (`org:invoices:create`) which allows only users with this permission to edit invoices. Then, you could assign this permission to a role, or multiple roles, such as **Billing** (`org:billing`) or **Sales** (`org:sales`).
1. Select **Create permission**.

## Verify a user's role or permission

It's best practice to always verify whether or not a user is **authorized** to access sensitive information, important content, or exclusive features. **Authorization** is the process of determining the access rights and privileges of a user, ensuring they have the necessary permissions to perform specific actions. To perform authorization checks using a user's role or permission, see the [guide on authorizing users](/docs/guides/authorization-checks).
