# The Backend `Client` object

The Backend `Client` object is similar to the [`Client`](/docs/references/javascript/client) object as it holds information about the authenticated sessions in the current device. However, the Backend `Client` object is different from the `Client` object in that it is used in the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Clients#operation/GetClient) and is not directly accessible from the Frontend API.
