title: '`auth()`'
description: Access minimal authentication data for managing sessions and data fetching.
---

The `auth()` helper returns the [`Auth`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }} object of the currently active user, as well as the [`redirectToSignIn()`](#redirect-to-sign-in) method. It includes a single method, `protect()`, which you can use to check if a user is authenticated or authorized to access certain parts of your application or even entire routes.

- Only available for App Router.
- Only works on the server-side, such as in Server Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions.
- Requires [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware) to be configured.

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `acceptsToken?`
  - `TokenType`

  The type of authentication token(s) to accept. Valid values are:

  - `'session_token'`
  - `'oauth_token'`
  - `'machine_token'`
  - `'api_key'`

  Can be set to:

  - A single token type.
  - An array of token types.
  - `'any'` to accept all available token types.

  Defaults to `'session_token'`.
</Properties>

## `auth.protect()`

`auth` includes a single property, the `protect()` method, which you can use in three ways:

- to check if a user is authenticated (signed in)
- to check if a user is authorized (has the correct roles or permissions) to access something, such as a component or a route handler
- to check if a request includes a valid machine token (e.g. API key or OAuth token) and enforce access rules accordingly

The following table describes how `auth.protect()` behaves based on user authentication or authorization status:

| Authenticated | Authorized | `auth.protect()` will |
| - | - | - |
| Yes | Yes | Return the [`Auth`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }} object. |
| Yes | No | Return a `404` error. |
| No | No | Redirect the user to the sign-in page\*\*. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For non-document requests, such as API requests, `auth.protect()` returns:
>
> - A `404` error for unauthenticated requests with session token type.
> - A `401` error for unauthenticated requests with machine token types.

`auth.protect()` accepts the following parameters:

<Properties>
  - `role?`
  - `string`

  The role to check for.

  ---

  - `permission?`
  - `string`

  The permission to check for.

  ---

  - `has?`
  - `(isAuthorizedParams: CheckAuthorizationParamsWithCustomPermissions) => boolean`

  A function that checks if the user has an organization role or custom permission. See the [reference](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#has) for more information.

  ---

  - `unauthorizedUrl?`
  - `string`

  The URL to redirect the user to if they are not authorized.

  ---

  - `unauthenticatedUrl?`
  - `string`

  The URL to redirect the user to if they are not authenticated.

  ---

  - `token?`
  - `TokenType`

  The type of authentication token(s) to accept. Valid values are:

  - `'session_token'`
  - `'oauth_token'`
  - `'machine_token'`
  - `'api_key'`

  Can be set to:

  - A single token type.
  - An array of token types.
  - `'any'` to accept all available token types.

  Defaults to `'session_token'`.
</Properties>

### Example

`auth.protect()` can be used to check if a user is authenticated or authorized to access certain parts of your application or even entire routes. See detailed examples in the [guide on verifying if a user is authorized](/docs/guides/authorization-checks).

## Returns

The `auth()` helper returns the following:

- The [`Auth`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }} object.
- The [`redirectToSignIn()`](#redirect-to-sign-in) method.

### `redirectToSignIn()`

The `auth()` helper returns the `redirectToSignIn()` method, which you can use to redirect the user to the sign-in page.

`redirectToSignIn()` accepts the following parameters:

<Properties>
  - `returnBackUrl?`
  - `string | URL`

  The URL to redirect the user back to after they sign in.
</Properties>

> [!NOTE]
> `auth()` on the server-side can only access redirect URLs defined via [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) or [`clerkMiddleware` dynamic keys](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#dynamic-keys).

#### Example

The following example shows how to use `redirectToSignIn()` to redirect the user to the sign-in page if they are not authenticated. It's also common to use `redirectToSignIn()` in `clerkMiddleware()` to protect entire routes; see [the `clerkMiddleware()` docs](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware) for more information.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default async function Page() {
  const { userId, redirectToSignIn } = await auth()

  if (!userId) return redirectToSignIn()

  return <h1>Hello, {userId}</h1>
}
```

## `auth()` usage

### Protect pages and routes

You can use `auth()` to check if a `userId` exists. If it's null, then there is not an authenticated (signed in) user. See detailed examples in the [dedicated guide](/docs/references/nextjs/read-session-data).

### Check if a user is authorized

You can use `auth()` to check if a user is authorized to access certain parts of your application or even entire routes by checking their type of access control. See detailed examples in the [guide on verifying if a user is authorized](/docs/guides/authorization-checks).

### Verify machine requests

You can use `auth()` to verify OAuth access tokens by passing in the `acceptsToken` parameter. See detailed examples in the [guide on verifying OAuth access tokens](/docs/references/nextjs/verifying-oauth-access-tokens).

### Data fetching with `getToken()`

If you need to send a JWT along to a server, `getToken()` retrieves the current user's [session token](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens) or a [custom JWT template](/docs/backend-requests/jwt-templates). See detailed examples in the [`Auth` object reference](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#get-token){{ target: '_blank' }}.
