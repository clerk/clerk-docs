<Include src="_partials/custom-flows/future-api-callout" />

The `WaitlistFuture` class provides methods and properties to manage waitlist entries in your application. It is used when you want to build a custom waitlist UI instead of using the prebuilt [`<Waitlist />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/waitlist) component.

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `id`
  - `string | undefined`

  The unique identifier for the waitlist entry. `undefined` if the user has not joined the waitlist yet.

  ---

  - `createdAt`
  - `Date | null`

  The date and time the waitlist entry was created. `null` if the user has not joined the waitlist yet.

  ---

  - `updatedAt`
  - `Date | null`

  The date and time the waitlist entry was last updated. `null` if the user has not joined the waitlist yet.
</Properties>

## Methods

### `join()`

Submits an email address to join the waitlist. This method creates a new waitlist entry for the provided email address.

```ts
function join(params: JoinWaitlistParams): Promise<{ error: unknown }>
```

#### `JoinWaitlistParams`

<Properties>
  - `emailAddress`
  - `string`

  The email address to add to the waitlist.
</Properties>

#### Example

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/waitlist/page.tsx' }}
'use client'

import { useWaitlist } from '@clerk/react'

export default function WaitlistPage() {
  const { waitlist } = useWaitlist()

  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget)
    const emailAddress = formData.get('emailAddress') as string

    const { error } = await waitlist.join({ emailAddress })

    if (error) {
      console.error('Failed to join waitlist:', error)
    }
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="email" name="emailAddress" required />
      <button type="submit">Join Waitlist</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```
