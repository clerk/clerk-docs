ClerkKitUI provides a couple of helpers to prefetch OAuth logos and your app logo into the image cache.

## Prefetch from the Clerk instance

```swift
import ClerkKitUI

@Environment(Clerk.self) private var clerk

if clerk.isLoaded {
  clerk.prefetchImages()
}
```

## Prefetch from a view

```swift
import ClerkKitUI
import SwiftUI

@main
struct MyApp: App {
  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      ContentView()
        .prefetchClerkImages()
    }
  }
}
```

### `prefetchClerkImages()`

This view modifier waits for the Clerk environment to load, then prefetches OAuth provider logos and your app logo (light and dark variants) into Nuke's cache.
