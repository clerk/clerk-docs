# Email links

[Email links](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#authentication-strategy) can be used to easily authenticate users or verify their email addresses. The email link flow looks like this:

1. The user enters their email address and asks for an email link.
2. Clerk sends an email to the user, containing a link to the verification URL.
3. The user clicks the email link. This can happen on the same device where they entered their email address, or on a different device.
4. Clerk will verify the user's identity and advance any sign-in or sign-up attempt that might be in progress. In case the verification fails, Clerk will inform the user.
5. If the verification is successful, the user is signed in or signed up, or their email address is verified.

Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) handle the entire email link flow for you, but you can also use the Clerk API to create a completely custom email link flow. Clerk's API is highly flexible and allows you to hook into any of the above steps while abstracting away all the complexities of an email link-based authentication or verification flow. This guide will walk you through how to build a custom email link flow using the [`useSignUp()`](/docs/references/react/use-sign-up) and [`useSignIn()`](/docs/references/react/use-sign-up) hooks.

### Enable email link authentication

To use email and password authentication, you first need to enable these authentication strategies in the Clerk Dashboard.

1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
2. Go to **User & Authentication > [Email, Phone, and Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username)** in the sidebar menu.
3. Ensure that you've configured your application instance to request the user's email address, as users can receive email links only via email messages. In the **Contact information** section, **Email address** should be toggled on.
4. In the **Authentication strategies** section, toggle on **Email verification link**.

  alt="The 'Authentication factors' section of the 'Email, Phone, and Username' page in the Clerk dashboard. There is a red arrow pointing to the 'Email verification link' toggle, which is toggled on."
/>

Users can now sign up and sign in with their email addresses using email links.

### Enable email link verification

**Verification methods** are different from **Authentication strategies**. **Verification methods** are used for verifying a user's identifier, such as an email address upon initial sign-up or when updating their profile. **Authentication strategies** are used for authenticating a user, such as when they are signing in to your application.

1. On this same page, next to **Email address**, click on the settings cog icon.
2. In the modal that pops up, there is a **Verification methods** section. Check the box for the **Email verification link** option. For the sake of this guide, uncheck the box for **Email verification code**.
3. Click **Continue** in the bottom right corner.

#### Create the email link sign-up flow

To sign up a user using an email link, you need to:

1. Initiate the sign-up process by collecting the user's email address.
2. Start the email link verification flow. There are two parts to the flow:
  - Prepare a verification for the email address by sending an email with an email link to the user.
  - Wait until the email link is clicked. This is a polling behavior that can be canceled at any time.
3. Handle the email link verification result accordingly. Note that the email link can be clicked on a different device/browser than the one which initiated the flow.
  - The verification was successful so you need to continue with the sign-up flow.
  - The verification failed or the email link has expired.

In the following example, the user is prompted to enter their email address and then click a button to sign up using an email link. The user is then redirected to a verification page where they can see the result of the email link verification.

#### Create the email link sign-in flow

To authenticate a user using an email link, you need to:

1. Initiate the sign-in process by collecting the user's authentication identifier.
2. Start the email link verification flow. There are two parts to the flow:
  - Prepare a verification for the email address by sending an email with an email link to the user.
  - Wait until the email link is clicked. This is a polling behavior that can be canceled at any time.
3. Handle the email link verification result accordingly. Note that the email link can be clicked on a different device/browser than the one which initiated the flow.
  - The verification was successful so you need to continue with the sign-in flow.
  - The verification failed or the email link has expired.

In the following example, the user is prompted to enter their email address and then click a button to sign in using an email link. The user is then redirected to a verification page where they can see the result of the email link verification.

#### Create the email link verification flow

Email links can also provide a nice user experience for verifying email addresses that users add when updating their profiles. The flow is similar to one-time code verification, but users need only click on the email link; there's no need to return to your app.

1. Initiate the verification process by collecting the user's email address.
2. Start the email link verification flow. There are two parts to the flow:
  - Prepare a verification for the email address by sending an email with an email link to the user.
  - Wait until the email link is clicked. This is a polling behavior that can be canceled at any time.
3. Handle the email link verification result accordingly. Note that the email link can be clicked on a different device/browser than the one which initiated the flow.
  - The verification was successful.
  - The verification failed or the email link has expired.

In the following example, the user is prompted to enter their email address and then click a button to verify their email address using an email link. The user is then redirected to a verification page where they can see the result of the email link verification.
