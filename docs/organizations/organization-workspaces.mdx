description: Use the Clerk Dashboard to create and invite collaborators to an organization workspace, and to transfer your apps between workspaces.

In the Clerk Dashboard, there are two types of workspaces:

- **Personal account**: A personal account/workspace is a user's unique, individual space, independent of any organization.
- **Organization workspace**: An organization workspace is owned and managed by an organization, which can have multiple members, also known as collaborators. The organization workspace that a user is currently viewing is called the [active organization](/docs/organizations/overview#active-organization).

This guide will walk you through how to use the Clerk Dashboard to create an organization workspace, invite collaborators, and transfer your apps between workspaces.
