# Getting started with the Account Portal

To integrate the Account Portal into your application, simply follow one of our [quickstart guides](/docs/quickstarts/overview).

Once your application is set up, all you have to do is fire it up. Clerk will automatically redirect your users to the Account Portal sign-in/sign-up pages. Once a user has successfully authenticated themself, they will be automatically redirected back to your application with an active session.

  **Dynamic Development Host Detection**

  For development environments, the development host (e.g. [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) is dynamically detected by Clerk at runtime and tied to your client browser. We store this as the ‘home origin’ for your application and it is equivalent to your application domain in production environments.

## Accessing your pages

For development environments, Clerk will issue you a randomly generated domain on "accounts.dev". In production, by default, the URLs for your Account Portal are the following:

```sh {{ prettier: false }}
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/sign-in
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/sign-up
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/user
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/organization
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/create-organization
```

To access these links, in the Clerk Dashboard, go to the **[Account Portal](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal)** page and then open the **Pages** tab.
