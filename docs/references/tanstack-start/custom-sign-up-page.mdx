title: Build your own sign-up page for your TanStack Start app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add a custom sign-up page to your TanStack Start app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

By default, the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/references/tanstack-start/custom-sign-in-or-up-page) component handles signing in and signing up, but if you'd like to have a dedicated sign-up page, this guide shows you how to use the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component to build a custom sign-up page.

To set up a single sign-in-or-up page, follow the [custom sign-in-or-up page guide](/docs/references/tanstack-start/custom-sign-in-or-up-page).

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component on a dedicated sign-up page using the [TanStack Router catch-all route](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/routing/routing-concepts#splat--catch-all-routes).

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-up.$.tsx' }}
  import { SignUp } from '@clerk/tanstack-start'
  import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/sign-up/$')({
    component: Page,
  })

  function Page() {
    return <SignUp />
  }
  ```

  ## Configure your sign-up page

  - Set the `CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` environment variable to tell Clerk where the `<SignUp />` component is being hosted.
  - Set `CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users visit the `/sign-up` route directly.
  - Set `CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users select the 'Already have an account? Sign in' link at the bottom of the component.

  Learn more about these environment variables and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/custom-redirects).

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
  CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
  ```

  ## Visit your new pages

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/sign-up).
