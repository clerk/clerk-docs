# Express server-side changes

<Callout type="info">
  Before starting this guide, please complete the [Client-side changes](/docs/upgrade-guides/v3-client-side-changes).
</Callout>

## Middleware

Express middleware been updated to mirror the new [`useAuth()`][use-auth] hook on the client-side.

- `ClerkExpressWithSession` is deprecated and replaced with `ClerkExpressWithAuth`
- `ClerkExpressRequireSession` is deprecated and replaced with `ClerkExpressRequireAuth`
- Instead of decorating the `Request` object with a `Session` object, it is now decorated with an `Auth` object that mirrors [`useAuth()`][use-auth] on the client-side.
  - `const { userId, sessionId, getToken } = req.auth;`

### Example usage

```js
import { ClerkExpressRequireAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

app.use(ClerkExpressRequireAuth());
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const { userId, sessionId, getToken } = req.auth;
  // Your handler...
})
```
