# Import and export users

If you need some guidance or have 200k+ users, please reach out to [support](https://clerk.com/support).

## Import users

You can use the [Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/CreateUser) to create users and import them from your previous provider. 

## Export users

A list of users can be retrieved for use in any exports by calling the backend API found [here](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/GetUserList). 

The [`getUserList()`](/docs/references/backend/user/get-user-list) method in the [Clerk Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) can also be used to retrieve a list of users.
