description: Access and manage the waitlist state in your React application with Clerk's useWaitlist() hook.
sdk: chrome-extension, expo, nextjs, react, react-router, remix, tanstack-react-start
---

The `useWaitlist()` hook provides access to the [`Waitlist`](/docs/reference/javascript/waitlist) object, which provides methods and properties to manage waitlist entries in your application. This hook useful for building a [custom flow](!custom-flow) instead of using the prebuilt [`<Waitlist />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/waitlist) component.

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `waitlist`
  - [`Waitlist`](/docs/reference/javascript/waitlist)

  The current active `Waitlist` instance, for use in custom flows.

  ---

  - `errors`
  - `Errors`

  The errors that occurred during the last API request.

  ---

  - `fetchStatus`
  - `'idle' | 'fetching'`

  The fetch status of the underlying `Waitlist` resource.
</Properties>

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the `useWaitlist()` hook to create a custom waitlist form. Users can submit their email address to join the waitlist, and the component displays appropriate feedback based on the submission state.
