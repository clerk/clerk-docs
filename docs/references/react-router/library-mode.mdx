React Router can be used as a framework or as a standalone library. This guide explains how to add React Router authentication to an existing React application using library mode. To use React Router as a framework instead, see the [React Router quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/react-router).

<Steps>
  ## Install `@clerk/react-router`

  The [Clerk React Router SDK](/docs/references/react-router/overview) provides prebuilt components, hooks, and helpers to make it easy to integrate authentication and user management in your React Router app.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/react-router
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/react-router
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/react-router
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun add @clerk/react-router
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  > [!NOTE]
  > You will not need the Clerk Secret Key in React Router's library mode, as it should never be used on the client-side.

  <SignedIn>
    Add your Clerk Publishable Key to your `.env` file. This key can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of the Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable Key.
    1. Add your key to your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  ```

  ## Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your app

  <Include src="_partials/clerk-provider/explanation" />

  You must pass your Publishable Key as a prop, as shown in the following example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [4, 8, [13, 17]] }}
  import { StrictMode } from 'react'
  import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
  import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router'
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/react-router'
  import './index.css'
  import App from './App.tsx'

  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <StrictMode>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<App />} />
          </Routes>
        </ClerkProvider>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

  ## Create a header with Clerk components

  You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with the [prebuilt control components](/docs/components/overview#control-components). The following example creates a header using the following components:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button): Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page or displays the sign-in modal.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/App.tsx' }}
  import { SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from '@clerk/react-router'

  export default function App() {
    return (
      <header>
        <SignedOut>
          <SignInButton />
        </SignedOut>
        <SignedIn>
          <UserButton />
        </SignedIn>
      </header>
    )
  }
  ```
</Steps>
