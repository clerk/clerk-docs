The Clerk integration is required to integrate Clerk into your Astro application, providing session and user context to Clerk's hooks, nanostores, and components.

## Usage

To configure Clerk with Astro, you must pass the `clerk()` integration to the `integrations` array in your `astro.config.mjs` file. The `clerk()` integration accepts optional options, such as `{ signInForceRedirectUrl: '/dashboard' }`. See the [properties section](#properties) for more information.

> [!WARNING]
> For SSR, there is further configuration required. See the [quickstart](/docs/astro/getting-started/quickstart#update-astro-config-mjs) for more information.

```ts {{ filename: 'astro.config.mjs' }}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import clerk from '@clerk/astro'

export default defineConfig({
  // Can accept options, such as { signInForceRedirectUrl: '/dashboard' }
  integrations: [clerk()],
})
```
