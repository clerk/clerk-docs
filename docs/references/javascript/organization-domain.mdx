## `delete()`

Deletes the organization domain and removes it from the organization.

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function delete: () => Promise<void>;
```

## `prepareAffiliationVerification()`

Begins the verification process of a created organization domain. This is a required step in order to complete the registration of the domain under the organization.

```

### `PrepareAffiliationVerificationParams`

| Name | Type | Description |

Make sure that an `OrganizationDomain` object already exists before you call this method, by first calling [`OrganizationDomain.prepareAffiliationVerification`](#prepare-affiliation-verification).

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function attemptAffiliationVerification(params: AttemptAffiliationVerificationParams): Promise<OrganizationDomain>;
```

### `AttemptAffiliationVerificationParams`
