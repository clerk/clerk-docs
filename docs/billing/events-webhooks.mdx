Clerk billing supports webhook events that allow you to track information like subscription lifecycles and payments.

## Subscriptions

A subscription is a top-level container unique to each user or organization. Subscription events can help you track billing changes for each of your customers.

| Event Name | Description |
| - | - |
| `subscription.created` | The top-level subscription is created. This usually happens when a user or organization is created. For existing users and organizations, a subscription will be created when billing is enabled for the application. |
| `subscription.updated` | The top-level subscription is updated. This event is triggered when any property of the subscription has changed, except for status changes. For example, when the subscription items for the payer change. |
| `subscription.active` | The top-level subscription transitions to active from a non-active status. This happens when any subscription item is set to active, including items from the free default plan. |
| `subscription.pastDue` | The top-level subscription contains a subscription item that has become past due. |

## Subscription items

A subscription item provides details about the relationship between the payer (user or organization) and a plan. A top-level subscription may contain multiple subscription items.

There can only be one `active` subscription item per payer and plan. In addition, the subscription item for the default plan will always have the same `id` to allow easier tracking of which users and organizations are not paid customers.

| Event Name | Description |
| - | - |
| `subscriptionItem.updated` | The subscription item is updated. This event is triggered when a property of the subscription item has changed that does not result in a status change. For example, when a subscription item is renewed and the recurring monthly charge succeeds, the status doesn't change (remains `active`), but `period_start` and `period_end` are updated. This results in a `subscriptionItem.updated` event. |
| `subscriptionItem.active` | The subscription item is set to active. For paid plans, this happens on successful payment. |
| `subscriptionItem.canceled` | The subscription item is canceled. The payer retains plan features until the end of the current billing period. |
| `subscriptionItem.upcoming` | The subscription item is set as upcoming after the current billing period. This can happen in the case of a deferred plan change from a higher-priced to lower-priced plan. In the case a paid plan is canceled, the subscription item for the default, free plan will be set as `upcoming`. |
| `subscriptionItem.ended` | The subscription item has ended. |
| `subscriptionItem.abandoned` | The subscription item is abandoned. This can happen to `upcoming` subscription items if the payer subscribes to another plan, or re-subscribes to a currently canceled plan. |
| `subscriptionItem.incomplete` | The subscription item is incomplete. This means the payer has started a checkout for a plan, but the payment hasn't been successfully processed yet. Once payment succeeds, the subscription item transitions to an `active` status. |
| `subscriptionItem.pastDue` | The subscription item is past due because a recurring charge has failed. |
| `subscriptionItem.freeTrialEnding` | The subscription item is a free trial and is ending soon. This event is sent three days before the trial ends. If the trial is shorter than three days, it's sent immediately. |

## Payment attempts

Payment attempts allow you to track successful and failed payments, for both checkout and recurring charges.

Payment attempt events contain a `type`, which can be either `checkout` or `recurring`. You can use these values to determine whether a payment attempt was for a checkout or a subscription item renewal's recurring charge.

| Event Name | Description |
| - | - |
| `paymentAttempt.created` | A payment attempt has been created with `pending` status. It can either succeed or fail in the future. |
| `paymentAttempt.updated` | A payment attempt has been updated to `paid` or `failed` status. |
