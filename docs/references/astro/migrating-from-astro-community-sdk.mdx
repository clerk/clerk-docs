# Migrating from the Astro community SDK

In June 2024, we introduced official support for Astro. This minimal guide highlights the breaking changes that were introduced and provides examples on how to resolve them.


**Overview:**
- Install `@clerk/astro`, uninstall `astro-clerk-auth`
- Update import paths
- Replace already deprecated APIs

## Installation

Uninstall the community SDK and install the new offical SDK for Astro.

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash filename="terminal"
    npm uninstall astro-clerk-auth
    npm install @clerk/astro
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    yarn remove astro-clerk-auth
    yarn add @clerk/astro
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    pnpm remove astro-clerk-auth
    pnpm add @clerk/astro
    ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Update import paths
We have kept breaking changes to the minimum and there is a great chance that it will not affect your existing codebase.
As a quick solution find all the usages of `astro-clerk-auth/` and replace them `@clerk/astro/`

```diff
- import { clerkMiddleware } from "astro-clerk-auth/server"
+ import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/astro/server"

- import { SignIn } from "astro-clerk-auth/components/interactive"
+ import { SignIn } from "@clerk/astro/components/interactive"

```


## Breaking Changes

### The integration

When using the integration from `@clerk/astro` we are now hotloading clerk-js by default.

```diff
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import node from "@astrojs/node";
- import clerk from "astro-clerk-auth/hotload"
+ import clerk from "@clerk/astro";

export default defineConfig({
    integrations: [clerk()],
    output: "server",
    adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }),
});
```

**Bundled** \
And in order to opt-in to the bundled clerk-js strategy you can do the following

```diff
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import node from "@astrojs/node";
- import clerk from "astro-clerk-auth"
+ import clerk from "@clerk/astro/bundled";

export default defineConfig({
    integrations: [clerk()],
    output: "server",
    adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }),
});
```

### Changes related to stores.

Submodule `/stores` was replaced with `/client/stores`. For the full list of the stores see [here](TODO: add reference)

```diff
- import { $clerk } from "astro-clerk-auth/stores"
+ import { $clerkStore } from "@clerk/astro/client/stores"


- import { $csrState } from "astro-clerk-auth/stores"
- import { $initialState } from "astro-clerk-auth/stores"
+ import { $userStore } from "@clerk/astro/client/stores"
+ import { $sessionStore } from "@clerk/astro/client/stores"
```

### Submodule removal

Submodule `/v0` was dropped completely and the previously exported constants are no longer available.

```diff
- import { apiKey, secretKey, DOMAIN, ... } from "astro-clerk-auth/v0"
```

### `clerkClient` changes

`clerkClient` as a variable was already deprecated. Now it should be used as a function and it accepts the Astro context.

```diff
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";
- import { clerkClient } from "astro-clerk-auth/v0"
+ import { clerkClient } from "@clerk/astro/server"

export const GET: APIRoute = async (context) => {
-   clerkClient.users.getUser(...)
+   clerkClient(context).users.getUser(...)
  ...
};
```

### React components changes

Submodule `components/react` has been removed.

```diff
---
- import { SignedIn } from "@clerk/astro/components/react";
+ import { SignedIn } from "@clerk/astro/client/react";
---

- <SignedIn>
+ <SignedIn client:load>
  {...}
</SignedIn>
```
