How to set up social connection with Slack

## Overview

Adding social connection with Slack to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URL** in your instance settings.

> Please note that Sign in with Slack doesn't support any additional OAuth scopes other than **openid**, **email**, **profile**, which are requested by default

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your Slack account.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Slack OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Slack account. To create one, [click here](https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew).

## Configuring Slack social connection

First, you need to create a new OAuth Slack app. On the main [Slack apps page](https://api.slack.com/apps), click on **Create new app**. On the modal that pops up, choose **From scratch,** enter your application name and choose a Slack workspace to associate with it.

In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)** and enable Slack. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Navigate to **OAuth & Permissions > Redirect URLs** and paste the value to add a new record.

Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** as shown in the above image from the Basic Information menu of your app. Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with Slack is now configured for your instance.
