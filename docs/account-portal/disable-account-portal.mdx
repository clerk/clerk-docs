title: Disabling the Account Portal
description: Learn how to disable the Account Portal.
---

If you would like to disable the Account Portal, in the Clerk Dashboard, go to the **[Account Portal](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal)** page and then open the **Danger** tab. Please ensure that you set up an authentication flow for your users via the instructions below first, as applying this setting will immediately result in a 404 for all Account Portal pages.

<Callout type="danger">
  We recommend leaving the Account Portal enabled, even if you do choose to set up your own authentication flow. This helps with testing as well as providing an alternative path for users when needed.
</Callout>

## Customizing your sign-up/sign-in flow

If you would like to migrate away from the Account Portal and create your own sign-up/sign-in flow, Clerk provides a set of [pre-built components](/docs/components/overview) that you can use, or you can opt to build your own [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview).
