<Steps>
  ## Create an iOS Project

  To get started using Clerk with iOS, create a new project in Xcode. Select SwiftUI as your interface and Swift as your language.
  See the [Xcode documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/creating-an-xcode-project-for-an-app) for more information.

  ## Install the Clerk iOS SDK

  Follow [the Swift Package Manager instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app) to install Clerk as a dependency.
  When prompted for the package URL, enter `https://github.com/clerk/clerk-ios`. Be sure to add the package to your target.

  ## Add your Native Application

  Add your iOS application to the [**Native Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=/native-applications) page in the Clerk dashboard. You will need your iOS app's **App ID Prefix** and **Bundle ID**.

  ## Add associated domain capability

  To enable seamless authentication flows, you need to add an associated domain capability to your iOS app. This allows your app to work with Clerk's authentication services.

  1. In Xcode, select your project in the Project Navigator.
  1. Select your app target.
  1. Navigate to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab.
  1. Select the **+ Capability** option.
  1. Search for and add **Associated Domains**. It will be added as a dropdown to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab.
  1. Under **Associated Domains**, add a new entry with the value: `webcredentials:{YOUR_FRONTEND_API_URL}`

  > [!NOTE]
  > Replace `{YOUR_FRONTEND_API_URL}` with your Frontend API URL, which can be found on the [**Native Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=native-applications) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

  ## Load Clerk

  To use Clerk in your app, you must first configure and load `Clerk`.

  1. Inside your new project in Xcode, open your `@main` app file.
  1. Import `Clerk`.
  1. Create a reference to the shared `Clerk` instance.
  1. Inject the `clerk` instance into the SwiftUI environment using `.environment(\.clerk, clerk)` so your views can access it.
  1. Add a `.task` modifier that configures Clerk with your Clerk Publishable Key and loads it when the app starts.<SignedOut>You can retrieve your Publishable Key from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.</SignedOut>

  ```swift {{ filename: 'ClerkQuickstartApp.swift', mark: [2, 6, [11, 15]] }}
  import SwiftUI
  import Clerk

  @main
  struct ClerkQuickstartApp: App {
    @State private var clerk = Clerk.shared

    var body: some Scene {
      WindowGroup {
        ContentView()
          .environment(\.clerk, clerk)
          .task {
            clerk.configure(publishableKey: "{{pub_key}}")
            try? await clerk.load()
          }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ## Conditionally render content

  To render content based on whether a user is authenticated or not:

  1. Open your `ContentView` file.
  1. Import `Clerk` and access the shared `Clerk` instance that you injected into the environment in the previous step.
  1. Replace the content of the view body with a conditional that checks for a `clerk.user`.

  ```swift {{ filename: 'ContentView.swift', mark: [2, 5, [8, 14]] }}
  import SwiftUI
  import Clerk

  struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.clerk) private var clerk

    var body: some View {
      VStack {
        if let user = clerk.user {
          Text("Hello, \(user.firstName ?? "User")")
        } else {
          Text("You are signed out")
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ## Use Clerk's prebuilt components

  Clerk provides prebuilt SwiftUI components that handle authentication flows and user management, eliminating the need to build custom forms and flows.

  Update your `ContentView` to use Clerk's prebuilt components. Replace the existing content with the following code:

  ```swift {{ filename: 'ContentView.swift', mark: [2, 5, 6, [9, 21]] }}
  import SwiftUI
  import Clerk

  struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.clerk) private var clerk
    @State private var authIsPresented = false

    var body: some View {
      VStack {
        if clerk.user != nil {
          UserButton()
            .frame(width: 36, height: 36)
        } else {
          Button("Sign in") {
            authIsPresented = true
          }
        }
      }
      .sheet(isPresented: $authIsPresented) {
        AuthView()
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  The updated `ContentView` uses two key Clerk components:

  - [`AuthView`](/docs/references/ios/auth-view): A comprehensive authentication view that handles sign-in and sign-up flows, including email verification, password reset, and multi-factor authentication. It's presented as a sheet when the user taps "Sign in".

  - [`UserButton`](/docs/references/ios/user-button): A circular button that displays the user's profile image. When tapped, it automatically presents the [`UserProfileView`](/docs/references/ios/user-profile-view) where users can manage their account, update their profile, and sign out.

  ## Create your first user

  Run your project. When you tap "Sign in", the `AuthView` will appear, allowing you to sign up or sign in.
