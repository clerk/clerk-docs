title: Build an MCP service in your Express application with Clerk
description: Learn how to build an MCP service using Clerk's OAuth server in your Express application.
---

If you're building an application and want to allow large language model (LLM) apps to securely access user data within your app, you'll need to set up a Model Context Protocol (MCP) service. MCP enables external tools like LLM-based apps to request user permission to access specific data from your service. Refer to the [dedicated MCP section](/docs/oauth/how-clerk-implements-oauth#building-a-model-context-protocol-mcp-service-using-clerk-s-o-auth-server) for more information.

There are two parties involved in MCP:

- The `client` is the LLM application that wants to access another service on a user's behalf. For example, Claude would be the "client" if it wants to get access to Gmail.
- The `server` is the system that hosts the protected resources the client wants to access. In this example, this would be Gmail. This is sometimes referred to as the "resource server" or "MCP server".

This guide demonstrates how to build an MCP server using Clerk's OAuth server in your Express app. It assumes that you have already integrated Clerk into your app by following the [quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/express) and installed the required packages: `express`, `@clerk/express` and `dotenv`. If not, install them as part of your Express + Clerk integration before proceeding.

> [!NOTE]
> Each part of the implementation is broken down into steps for clarity, but all logic lives in a single file.

<Steps>
  ## Install dependencies

  To get started, this implementation requires the following packages to be installed in your project:

  - [`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk): Provides the core SDK for building an MCP server, including utilities to define tools and handle LLM requests.
  - [`@clerk/mcp-tools`](https://github.com/clerk/mcp-tools): A helper library built on top of the MCP TypeScript SDK used to connect Clerk OAuth with MCP easily.

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk @clerk/mcp-tools
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @modelcontextprotocol/sdk @clerk/mcp-tools
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @modelcontextprotocol/sdk @clerk/mcp-tools
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun add @modelcontextprotocol/sdk @clerk/mcp-tools
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ## Set up your Express app with Clerk and MCP imports

  The following code shows the required imports and setup needed to implement an MCP server with Clerk.

  ```ts
  import 'dotenv/config'
  import { type MachineAuthObject, clerkClient, clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'
  import {
    mcpAuthClerk,
    protectedResourceHandlerClerk,
    streamableHttpHandler,
  } from '@clerk/mcp-tools/express'
  import { McpServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js'
  import express from 'express'

  const app = express()
  app.use(clerkMiddleware())
  app.use(express.json())

  app.listen(3000)
  ```

  ## Create your MCP server and define tools

  To let external LLM-powered tools securely interact with your app, you need to define an MCP server, and expose one or more [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources), [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts), and/or [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools). The following example registers a single tool called `get_clerk_user_data` that retrieves information about the authenticated Clerk user.

  1. The `McpServer` function is used to create a new MCP server with a name and version.
  1. The `server.tool()` function is used to define a tool that external LLM-based apps can invoke. Each tool includes:

     - A name (`get_clerk_user_data`).
     - A description of what the tool does.
     - Input parameters (none in this case).
     - A callback function that extracts the user's auth info from the OAuth token, fetches the user data using `clerk.users.getUser()` and returns it wrapped in a `content` array, which is MCP's expected response format.

  ```ts
  const server = new McpServer({
    name: 'test-server',
    version: '0.0.1',
  })

  server.tool(
    'get_clerk_user_data',
    'Gets data about the Clerk user that authorized this request',
    {},
    async (_, { authInfo }) => {
      const clerkAuthInfo = authInfo as unknown as MachineAuthObject<'oauth_token'>
      if (!clerkAuthInfo?.userId) {
        console.error(authInfo)
        return {
          content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Error: user not authenticated' }],
        }
      }
      const user = await clerkClient.users.getUser(clerkAuthInfo.userId)
      return {
        content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(user) }],
      }
    },
  )
  ```

  ## Secure and expose your MCP server

  Now that your MCP server and tools are defined, the next step is to secure your endpoints and expose them according to the MCP specification. To comply with the MCP specification, your server must expose OAuth resource metadata at a `well-known` endpoint. This metadata allows clients (like LLM tools) to know the authentication requirements and token formats your server accepts.

  Clerk provides prebuilt helpers that handle this for you:

  - `mcpAuthClerk`: Authentication middleware that automatically verifies the `Authorization` header using Clerk-issued OAuth tokens. If unauthorized, it returns a www-authenticate header [in accordance with the mcp specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization#authorization-server-location).
  - `protectedResourceHandlerClerk`: Express handler that serves OAuth protected resource metadata.
  - `streamableHttpHandler`: Express handler that connects your MCP server to incoming requests using the [streamable HTTP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#streamable-http).

  > [!NOTE]
  > For a more in-depth explanation of these helpers, see the [MCP Express reference](https://github.com/clerk/mcp-tools/tree/main/express).

  To secure your endpoints and expose your MCP server to a client:

  ```ts
  app.post('/mcp', mcpAuthClerk, streamableHttpHandler(server))
  app.get('/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource', protectedResourceHandlerClerk)
  ```

  ## Connecting your client to the MCP server

  The foundation of your MCP server is now set up. Clients that support the latest MCP spec can now invoke the `get-clerk-user-data` tool to securely fetch user data from your app, assuming the request is authorized with a Clerk OAuth token. Refer to the [verifying OAuth access tokens](/docs/oauth/oauth-verify-tokens) guide for more information.

  To complete the integration, you'll need to connect a MCP-compatible client to your MCP server. Most LLM tools that support MCP allow you to register custom servers in a configuration file.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Before proceeding, ensure you have toggled on the **Dynamic client registration** option in the [**OAuth Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/oauth-applications) page.
  > This setting allows MCP-compatible clients to automatically register themselves with your server during the OAuth flow.

  ### Example: Connecting Cursor to your Express MCP server

  1. Create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project root.

  1. Add the following configuration:

     ```json {{ filename: '.cursor/mcp.json' }}
     {
       "mcpServers": {
         "express-mcp-test": {
           "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp"
         }
       }
     }
     ```

  1. Start your MCP server by running `npm start`.

  1. Open **Cursor** and navigate to **Cursor Settings**.

  1. Select **Tools & Integrations** in the sidenav.

  1. Under **MCP Tools**, enable the custom MCP server you just added (`express-mcp-test`) via the toggle.

  1. Select the **Needs login** option once it appears. You'll be redirected to a Clerk OAuth consent screen to authorize Cursor to access your user data.

  1. Once authorized, the tool `get_clerk_user_data` should be listed as **enabled**.

  You are now ready to open an **Agent chat** in Cursor and prompt it to fetch your Clerk user data (e.g. What is my Clerk user data). You should receive a response similar to this:

  ```yaml
  Here is your Clerk user data:
  User ID: <user-id>
  Username: <username>
  First Name: <first-name>
  Last Name: <last-name>
  Primary Email: <primary-email>
  Secondary Email: <secondary-name>
  2FA Enabled: No
  Account Banned: No
  Account Locked: No
  Profile Image: <profile-image>
  External Accounts: <external-account>
  Organization Creation Enabled: Yes
  Delete Self Enabled: Yes
  ```

  ## Finished ðŸŽ‰

  You've now successfully connected your client to the MCP server and authenticated it using Clerk. Your LLM agent can securely access user data through the exposed tools in your server.
