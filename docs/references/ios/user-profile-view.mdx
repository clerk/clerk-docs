The `UserProfileView` component renders a comprehensive user profile interface that displays user information and provides account management options. It includes personal information, security settings, account switching, and sign-out functionality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `UserProfileView` only appears when a user is signed in.

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `isDismissable`
  - `Bool`

  Whether the view can be dismissed by the user. When `true`, a dismiss button appears in the navigation bar and the view can be used in sheets or other dismissable contexts. When `false`, no dismiss button is shown, making it suitable for full-screen usage. Defaults to `true`.
</Properties>

## Usage

The following examples show how to use the `UserProfileView` component in your iOS app.

### Dismissible sheet presentation

Present `UserProfileView` as a dismissible sheet when you want users to be able to close the profile view and return to the previous screen.

```swift
struct MainView: View {
  @Environment(\.clerk) private var clerk
  @State private var profileIsPresented = false

  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      if clerk.user != nil {
        Button("Show Profile") {
          profileIsPresented = true
        }
      }
    }
    .sheet(isPresented: $profileIsPresented) {
      UserProfileView()
    }
  }
}
```

### Full-screen profile view

Use `UserProfileView` as a full-screen view when you want to dedicate the entire screen to profile management.

```swift
struct ProfileView: View {
  @Environment(\.clerk) private var clerk

  var body: some View {
    if clerk.user != nil {
      UserProfileView(isDismissable: false)
    }
  }
}
```
