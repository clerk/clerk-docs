# Debug your webhooks

Developing with webhooks can be a new experience for developers. It can be hard to debug when something goes awry. This guide will cover the basics for debugging and help you to direct your attention to the correct spot.

## Webhooks and local development

When you or a user of your application performs certain actions, a webhook can be triggered. You can see the full list of [webhook events](/docs/integrations/webhooks/overview#supported-webhook-events) for a list of the actions that could result in a Webhook. Depending on the events subscribed to in the [Webhook section](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks) of your dashboard, a webhook event will be triggered and sent to the specified endpoint in your application.

When you are developing on your localhost, your application is not internet facing and can't receive the webhook request. You will need to use a tool that creates a tunnel from the internet to your localhost. These tools will provide temporary or permanant URLs depending on the tool and the plan you subscribe to. Popular tools include `ngrok`, `localtunnel` and `Cloudflare Tunnel`.

With the Webhook flow in mind, the following areas could cause problems when trying to develop with webhooks:

1. [Middleware is not configured correctly for webhooks](#check-your-middleware-configuration)
2. [The webhook route is not correctly configured](#test-the-route-handler-or-api-route)
3. [Configuration in your dashboard](#check-your-configuration-in-the-clerk-dashboard)
4. [The tunnel configuration](#debug-your-tunnel-and-webhook-delivery)
5. [Verification of the webhook](#debug-webhook-verification)
6. [The logic you created to process the webhook](#check-your-logic)


##  Check your Middleware configuration

Incoming webhook events will never be signed in -- they are coming from a source outside of your application. Since they will be in a signed out state, the route should be public. The simplest configuration is to use `ignoredRoutes` for your webhook routes when using `authMiddleware` and applying no protection to the route with `clerkMiddleware`. Below is an example of making all webhook routes ignored.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["clerkMiddleware", "authMiddleware"]}>
```tsx filename="middleware.tsx"
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

// Make sure that the `/api/webhooks/(.*)` route is not protected here
export default clerkMiddleware()

export const config = {
  matcher: [ '/((?!.*\\..*|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],
};
```

```tsx filename="middleware.tsx" {4}
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default authMiddleware({
  ignoredRoutes: ["/api/webhooks(.*)"],
});

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
};
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Test the Route Handler or API Route

If you are having trouble with your webhook, you can create a basic Route Handler and then test it locally.  First, add the following file and code to your app.

```ts filename="app/webhooks/test/route.ts"
export async function POST() {
   return Response.json({ message: 'The route is working' });
}
```

While your application is running, try this from the command line.

```bash
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/test
```

If you see the `{"message":"The route is working"}` then the basic Route Handler is working, and ready to build on.


## Check your configuration in the Clerk Dashboard

Whether you are developing locally or deploying to production, the webhook URL provided in your [webhook endpoint](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks) must be exact and correct. The URL breaks down into three parts -- the protocol (`http` vs `https`), the domain (`domain.com`) and the path (`/api/webhooks/user`).
- Whether in development using a tunnel or in production, the URL will almost always use `https`.
- The domain needs to be exact. A common error in production is not including the `www.`. Unlike entering a domain in your browser, a webhook will not be redirected from `domain.com` to `www.domain.com`. If your application lives on `www.domain.com` then the webhook URL must use that.
- The path must match the path in your application.

## Debug your tunnel and webhook delivery

You've setup your route and tested it, configured your tunnel, updated your dashboard and now are trying to use the webhook but are getting errors. You will want to visit the [Webhook section](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks) of your dashboard and the select the webhook you created.

You will see a 'Webhook Attempts' section and likely see that one or more of those attempts have failed. Click on the failed attempt to expand it. In the details for the attempt, there will be a 'HTTP RESPONSE CODE'. The code will likely be either a 500 or something starting with a 4, like 401 or 404.

Below is a table with some of the common response codes you might see, and what they indicate. This is not an exhaustive list and you may need to research the code or error you are receiving.

### HTTP Response Codes

| Code | Information |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 400  | This error usually indicates the verification failed, but could be caused by other issues |
| 401  | The request was not authorized. If your test in 'Test the Route Handler or API Route' worked, you should not see this error. If you are seeing it, then you will need to configure your Middleware to accept the request, |
| 404  | The URL for the webhook was not found. This indicates that either the URL you added to the Webhook in the dashboard was incorrect, your application is not running, or the path is wrong.|
| 405  | Your route is not accepting a POST request. All webhooks are POST requests, to the route must accept them. Unless you are using the route for somethinh else, you can restrict the route to POST requests only. |
| 500  | A 500 error indicates that something failed in the webhook code. The request made it to your application, but there is a code related issue. This is likely a webhook verification issue or something in the webhook logic. Please see the following sections.

You may run into other errors. See [HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) from MDN for reference.


## Debug webhook verification

To verify the webhook, your webhook route will need the Signing Secret from the Webhook section of the dashboard.  It will also need the Svix headers which are included in the request. Please see [Create the endpoint in your application](/docs/integrations/webhooks/sync-data#create-the-endpoint-in-your-application) for a detailed code example. You can also visit the [guide](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how) on verifying webhooks with the Svix library.

Diagnosing a problem in this part of the webhook can be challenging. Your best bet would be the liberal use of `console.log`. You could log out the following to check if the values are correct:
- the signing secret
- the headers
- the `body` before verifying
- the result of the `.verify()` attempt

The results of these will appear in the command line where you are running your application.

Checking the values and the progress of the webhook code will allow you to narrow down where the code is failing. The will often return null or errors where they should be returning values.

## Check your logic

Once you have verified the webhook, you will now be writing your own code to handle the values from the webhook. This could range from saving data to a databse, or integrating with another system, to updating users or sending emails or SMS.

If the webhook is verified and you are seeing a 500 status code or your webhook is not behaving as expected, remember that you can use `console.log` to help diagnose what the problem is. Console logs and error will be displayed on your command line, allowing you to see what's happening and address the bugs.
