Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your TanStack Start application.

<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/tanstack-start`

  Once you have a TanStack Start application ready, you need to install Clerk's [TanStack Start SDK](/docs/references/tanstack-start/overview). This gives you access to Clerk's prebuilt components and hooks for TanStack Start applications.
  
  Add the SDK to your project by running the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/tanstack-start
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/tanstack-start
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/tanstack-start
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your Clerk API keys

<SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env.local` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
    1. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
    1. Paste your keys into your `.env.local` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env.local' }}
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```
  Add the following keys to your `.env.local` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ### Add `clerkHandler` to your application

  To configure Clerk in your TanStack application, you will need to update the SSR entrypoint.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/ssr.tsx', ins: [4, [11, 14]], del: [[6, 9]] }}
  import { createStartHandler, defaultStreamHandler } from '@tanstack/start/server'
  import { getRouterManifest } from '@tanstack/start/router-manifest'
  import { createRouter } from './router'
  import { createClerkHandler } from '@clerk/tanstack-start/server'

  export default createStartHandler({
    createRouter,
    getRouterManifest,
  })(defaultStreamHandler)

  export default createClerkHandler(
    createStartHandler({
      createRouter,
      getRouterManifest,
    }),
  )(defaultStreamHandler)
  ```

  ### Add `<ClerkProvider>` and components to your app

  All Clerk hooks and components must be children of the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component, which provides active session and user context.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/__root.tsx', ins: [11, 28, 32] }}
  import { Outlet, ScrollRestoration, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
  import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/router-devtools'
  import { Body, Head, Html, Meta, Scripts } from '@tanstack/start'
  import * as React from 'react'
  import { DefaultCatchBoundary } from '~/components/DefaultCatchBoundary'
  import { NotFound } from '~/components/NotFound'
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/tanstack-start'
  import appCss from '~/styles/app.css?url'

  export const Route = createRootRoute({
    links: () => [{ rel: 'stylesheet', href: appCss }],
    errorComponent: (props) => {
      return (
        <RootDocument>
          <DefaultCatchBoundary {...props} />
        </RootDocument>
      )
    },
    notFoundComponent: () => <NotFound />,
    component: () => {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider>
          <RootDocument>
            <Outlet />
          </RootDocument>
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    },
  })

  function RootDocument({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    return (
      <Html>
        <Head>
          <Meta />
        </Head>
        <Body>
          {children}
          <ScrollRestoration />
          <TanStackRouterDevtools position="bottom-right" />
          <Scripts />
        </Body>
      </Html>
    )
  }
  ```

  ### Protect your pages

  #### Client side

  To protect your pages on the client side, you can use Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/components/overview#what-are-control-components) that control the visibility of content based on the user's authentication state.

  The following example uses the following components:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button): A prebuilt component that comes styled out of the box to show the avatar from the account the user is signed in with.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page. For this example, it links to the [Account Portal sign-in page.](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview)
  - [`<SignUpButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-up-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-up page or displays the sign-up modal, depending on which `mode` you have set. For this example, it links to the [Account Portal sign-up page.](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview)

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/index.tsx' }}
  import {
    SignedIn,
    UserButton,
    SignOutButton,
    SignedOut,
    SignInButton,
    SignUpButton,
  } from '@clerk/tanstack-start'
  import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
    component: Home,
  })

  function Home() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Index Route</h1>
        <SignedIn>
        <p>You are signed in!</p>

        <UserButton />

        <SignOutButton />
      </SignedIn>
        <SignedOut>
          <p>You are signed out</p>

          <SignInButton mode="modal" />

          <SignUpButton mode="modal" />
        </SignedOut>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  #### Server side

  To protect your routes, you can use the `beforeLoader` paired with server function to check for the `userId` singleton. If it doesn't exist, redirect your user back to the sign-in page.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/index.tsx' }}
  import { createFileRoute, useRouter, redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'
  import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'
  import { getAuth } from '@clerk/tanstack-start/server'

  const authStateFn = createServerFn('GET', async (_, { request }) => {
    const { userId } = await getAuth(request)

    if (!userId) {
      throw redirect({
        to: '/sign-in',
      })
    }

    return { userId }
  })

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
    component: Home,
    beforeLoad: await authStateFn(),
    loader: async ({ context }) => {
      return { userId: context.userId }
    },
  })

  function Home() {
    const router = useRouter()
    const state = Route.useLoaderData()

    return <h1>Welcome your id is {state.userId}!</h1>
  }
  ```
