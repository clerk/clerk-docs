This tutorial assumes that you're using [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

<Steps>
  ## Create a new Vue app

  If you don't already have a Vue app, run the following commands to [create a new one using Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project):

  ```npm
  npm create vite@latest clerk-vue -- --template vue-ts
  cd clerk-vue
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  ## Install `@clerk/vue`

  The [Clerk Vue SDK](/docs/reference/vue/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, composables, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  ```npm
  npm install @clerk/vue
  ```

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  <Include src="_partials/quickstarts/set-clerk-publishable-key" />

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  ```

  ## Add `clerkPlugin` to your app

  [`clerkPlugin`](/docs/reference/vue/clerk-plugin) provides session and user context to Clerk's components and composables. It's required to pass your Clerk [Publishable Key](!publishable-key) as an option. You can add an `if` statement to check that the key is imported properly. This prevents the app from running without the Publishable Key and catches TypeScript errors.

  The `clerkPlugin` accepts optional options, such as `{ signInForceRedirectUrl: '/dashboard' }`.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'src/main.ts', mark: [4, [12, 14]] }}
  import { createApp } from 'vue'
  import './style.css'
  import App from './App.vue'
  import { clerkPlugin } from '@clerk/vue'

  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
    throw new Error('Add your Clerk Publishable Key to the .env file')
  }

  const app = createApp(App)
  app.use(clerkPlugin, { publishableKey: PUBLISHABLE_KEY })
  app.mount('#app')
  ```

  ## Create a header with Clerk components

  You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/reference/components/overview#control-components). The following example creates a header using the following components:

  <Include src="_partials/quickstarts/create-header-components" />

  ```vue {{ filename: 'src/App.vue', mark: [2, [6, 13]] }}
  <script setup lang="ts">
  import { SignedIn, SignedOut, SignInButton, SignUpButton, UserButton } from '@clerk/vue'
  </script>

  <template>
    <header>
      {/* Show the sign-in button when the user is signed out */}
      <SignedOut>
        <SignInButton />
        <SignUpButton />
      </SignedOut>
      {/* Show the user button when the user is signed in */}
      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton />
      </SignedIn>
    </header>
  </template>
  ```

  <Include src="_partials/quickstarts/run-project" />

  <Include src="_partials/quickstarts/create-first-user-react" />
</Steps>
