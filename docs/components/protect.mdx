# `<Protect>`

The `<Protect>` component is used for authorization. It only renders its children when the current user has the specified [permission or role](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions) in the organization.

## Usage

You can pass either a `permission` or `role` key to `<Protect>` to limit who can see the content it renders. The recommended approach is to use `permission` because this lets you modify Roles without breaking your application. Permissions can be assigned to different Roles with ease.

If you do not pass either prop, `<Protect>` behaves the same as [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in) and will render its children if the user is signed in, regardless of their Role or its Permissions.

For more complex authorization logic, pass conditional logic to the `condition` prop.

### Render content by Permissions

The children of the following component will only be visible to users with Roles that have the `org:invoices:create` permission.

<Tabs type="framework" items={["Next.js", "React"]}>
  <Tab>
      ```jsx
      import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

      export default function ProtectPage() {
        return (
          <Protect
            permission="org:invoices:create"
            fallback={<p>You do not have the permissions to create an invoice.</p>}
          >
            {children}
          </Protect>
        );
      }
      ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```jsx
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          permission="org:invoices:create"
          fallback={<p>You do not have the permissions to create an invoice.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Render content by Role

While authorization by `permission` is recommended, `<Protect/>` allows a role key to be passed for convenience. The children of the following component will only be visible to users with the `org:billing` Role.

<Tabs type="framework" items={["Next.js", "React"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```jsx
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          role="org:billing"
          fallback={<p>Only a member of the Billing department can access this content.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```jsx
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          role="org:billing"
          fallback={<p>Only a member of the Billing department can access this content.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `condition` | `has => boolean` | Optional conditional logic that renders the children if it returns `true`. |
| `fallback` | `JSX` | An optional snippet of JSX to show when a user doesn't have the `role` or `permission` to access the protected content. |
| `permission` | `string` | Optional string corresponding to a Role's Permission in the format `org:<resource>:<action>` |
| `role` | `string` | Optional string corresponding to an Organization's Role in the format `org:<role>` |

<Callout type="warning">
