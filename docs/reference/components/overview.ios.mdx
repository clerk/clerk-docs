- [`UserButton`](/docs/reference/components/user/user-button) - Displays the signed-in user's profile image.

## Secured by Clerk branding

By default, Clerk displays a **Secured by Clerk** badge on Clerk components. You can remove this branding by following these steps:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to your application's [**Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=settings).
1. Under **Branding**, toggle on the **Remove "Secured by Clerk" branding** option. Please note that this setting requires a [paid plan](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} for production use, but all features are free to use in development mode so that you can try out what works for you. See the [pricing](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} page for more information.
