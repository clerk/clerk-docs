The [shadcn/ui CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) is a tool that allows you to bootstrap your Next.js app with Clerk. Clerk's shadcn/ui registry enables developers to add pre-built components and configurations to their projects with a single command. You can either get started with the [complete quickstart package](#quickstart), or add [pages](#pages) and [components](#components) individually.

## Quickstart

Get started with Clerk authentication in seconds using the complete quickstart package:

```npm {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
npx shadcn@latest add @clerk/nextjs-quickstart
```

This single command will install:

- App layout with ClerkProvider and theme integration
- Sign-in and sign-up pages with catch-all routes
- Clerk middleware for route protection
- Header component with authentication buttons
- Theme provider for dark/light mode support

## Pages

### Sign In

The sign-in page is a dedicated page that allows users to sign in to their account.

```npm {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
npx shadcn@latest add @clerk/nextjs-sign-in-page
```

### Sign Up

The sign-up page is a dedicated page that allows users to sign up for a new account which includes a two column layout with a list of selling points and a form to sign up.

```npm {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
npx shadcn@latest add @clerk/nextjs-sign-up-page
```

### Waitlist

The following example includes a basic implementation of the `<Waitlist />` component hosted on the `/waitlist` route. You can use this as a starting point for your own implementation.

```npm {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
npx shadcn@latest add @clerk/nextjs-waitlist-page
```

## Components

### `<ClerkProvider />`

The [`<ClerkProvider />`](/docs/reference/components/clerk-provider) component is required to integrate Clerk into your React application, providing session and user context to Clerk's hooks and components.

```npm {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
npx shadcn@latest add @clerk/nextjs-clerk-provider
```

With the ClerkProvider component installed, you can wrap your app's layout to provide Clerk's authentication context to your app.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx', mark: ['ClerkProvider'] }}
import { ClerkProvider } from '@/components/clerk-provider'
import './globals.css'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode
}>) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      <html lang="en">
        <body>{children}</body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}
```

## Files

### Middleware

The [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware) helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Next.js application through Middleware.

```npm {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
npx shadcn@latest add @clerk/nextjs-middleware
```
