## Community

Clerk is more than authentication, and we want to convey every feature of Clerk as best as we can to make authentication and user management simpler for everyone. Explaining these concepts can sometimes be tricky, but with the help of a community, we can collaborate, share ideas, find the right words, and achieve greater clarity.

We encourage you to contribute to Clerk's documentation! You can get started by following [this guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
