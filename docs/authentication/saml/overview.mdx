# SAML (Beta)

Clerk supports Enterprise SSO via the SAML protocol so that you can create authentication strategies for an Identity Provider (IdP). Currently, Clerk supports the following IdPs for Enterprise SSO:

- [Microsoft Azure AD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/whatis)
- [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/)
- [Okta Workforce](https://www.okta.com/workforce-identity/)

## Prerequisites

- A Clerk application that includes the [Enhanced authentication add-on](https://clerk.com/pricing), available with the Pro plan.
- **Email address** enabled as an identifier for your application. See the [Identifiers](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#identifiers) section to learn more about how to enable it.

<Steps>

### Create a SAML connection

To create a SAML connection in Clerk,

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).
2. In the navigation sidebar, select **User & Authentication > [Enterprise Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/enterprise-connections)**.
3. Select the **Create connection** button.
4. You will be presented with a modal to create a new connection. Fill in the required fields.
- **Name** - A unique name for the connection. This is so you can tell your connections apart.
- **Domain** - This is the email domain for which you will enable Enterprise SSO.
5. Once you have filled in these fields, you will be directed to the **Connection** page which has the configuration settings for the connection you just created. **Do not** select the **Enable connection** toggle just yet. You need to fully configure your IdP first before exposing your connection to your users while you're in the, sometimes long, process of configuring and testing it.

### Configure your service provider

Scroll down to the **Service Provider configuration** section. You will need to add these three fields to your IdP's application:

- **Single sign-on URL** - This is a unique identifier for your SAML connection that your IdP application needs.
- **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)** - This is your application's URL that your IdP will redirect your users back to after they have authenticated in your IdP.
- **Metadata URL** - This is the URL to your SAML connection's metadata file. This is the recommended way to configure your SP.

### Configure your identity provider

Scroll down to the **Identity Provider configuration** section. There are two options for configuring your IdP:

- **Custom configuration** - This is where you can manually input the configuration settings for your IdP.
- **Metadata configuration** - This is where you can input the URL to your IdP's metadata file. **This is the recommended way to configure your IdP.**

#### Custom configuration

If you choose to manually input the configuration settings for your IdP, you will need to add these three fields:

- **Sign on URL** - This is the unique identifier of your IdP application.
- **Issuer** - This is your IdP's URL that we'll redirect your users to so that they authenticate.
- **Certificate** - This is the certificate needed for Clerk to securely connect to your IdP.

### Map your IdP's claims to Clerk fields

{/* TODO: How does the attribute mapping settings in the dashboard work? */}

Scroll down to the **Attribute mapping** section.

Map your IdP claims to Clerk's `id`, `email`, `firstName`, `lastName` fields. The first two are required for the integration to work and the last two are required for getting the user's name.

{/* TODO: Add field for `id` to table below, and ensure this table is up to date and accurate */}

| Clerk Field | Azure AD Claim Names | Google Claim Names | Okta Claim Names |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mail` (required) | `user.userprincipalname` | Basic Information > Primary email | `user.email` |
| `firstName` | `user.givenname` | Basic Information > First name | `user.firstName` |
| `lastName` | `user.surname` | Basic Information > Last name | `user.lastName` |

### Map every other claim (optional)

{/* TODO: Should there be an example of how to do this? The mapping to public metadata? */}

To map other claims from your IdP, map them to your users' public metadata by prepending the Clerk claims with `public_metadata_`.

For example, the claim `public_metadata_country` with the value `Canada` will be saved in the user's `public_metadata` under the key `country` with the value `Canada`.

[Learn more about how to access the metadata from our APIs](/docs/users/metadata).

### Activate your SAML connection

Now that you have configured your SAML connection, scroll to the top of the **Connection** page and toggle on the **Enable connection** option. This will make the connection available for your users to authenticate with.

### Authenticate with SAML

Everything should be set up now for you to try out authentication via SAML. Go to your application's sign-in page and add your email in the input field. If it matches an active SAML connection, you will be redirected to your IdP where you will sign in with your credentials.

### Sync user attributes during sign in (optional)

During SAML SSO and after a user has successfully authenticated, the IdP provides Clerk with the corresponding user data. After each successful sign in, Clerk handles keeping the user data up-to-date based on the response of the SAML provider. This means that if a user's data changes on the IdP side, Clerk will automatically update the user's data in the Clerk database.

To disable this behavior,
1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).
2. In the navigation sidebar, select **User & Authentication > [Enterprise Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/enterprise-connections)**.
3. Select the SAML connection you want to disable the sync for.
4. Select the **Advanced** tab.
5. Toggle off the **Sync user attributes during Sign in** option.

## Allow subdomains (optional)

Authenticating via SAML SSO requires the user's email address domain to match the exact domain the SAML connection has been configured with. By default, subdomains are not supported. For example, a user with the email address `john@sales.example.com` would not be able to use a SAML connection with the `example.com` domain in order to authenticate.

To support SAML SSO with subdomains,
1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).
2. In the navigation sidebar, select **User & Authentication > [Enterprise Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/enterprise-connections)**.
3. Select the SAML connection you want to disable the sync for.
4. Select the **Advanced** tab.
5. Toggle on the **Allow subdomains** option.

<Callout type="info">
  To enable the **Allow subdomains** option, your SAML connection domain must be an eTLD+1.
</Callout>

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

**I've enabled other strategies but they don't work.**

A Clerk application can have multiple authentication strategies, but a domain that enables Enterprise SSO can not. Once Enterprise SSO is enabled for a domain, there can be no other authentication methods for that specific domain. This is in line with an organization's intent to manage their users' identity from one place. This will allow your Clerk application to enable Enterprise SSO connections for certain domains while others use non-Enterprise SSO methods depending on each organization's needs.

**Will SAML work for my existing users?**

Yes, SAML will work for your existing users as well! That means, that if you enable SAML, any existing users that their email address matches the SAML Connection domain, they will have to authenticate on the IdP side and an Enterprise Account will be linked to their existing account.

**What happens if I have multi-factor enabled at Clerk?**

This will work: Once the user comes back from the IdP, they will need to go through the extra factors of authentication. This is in case you need to add extra factors on top of what your IdP supports (or in case they don't). You can choose to not enable this feature if you wish.

**What happens if I delete the SAML connection? Will my users be deleted?**

The users will not be deleted, so your application will not break. However, they will need to “reintroduce” themselves to your new strategies by resetting their passwords or via OTP (depending on the strategy you choose).

**Does Clerk support IdP-initiated SSO?**

No, Clerk only supports SP-initiated flows at this time.

**How much does it cost now?**

It's going to be free during the Beta period.

**How much will it cost after Beta?**

It will cost $50 per active connection per month for production instances. Connections in development instances are and will be free, but capped to 5.

**Can I get a bulk discount?**

Yes, [reach out to us](https://clerk.com/support) and we will work a plan out.
