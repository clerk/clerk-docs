# Add React Router to your Clerk-powered React application

Learn how to add React Router to your application using React Router's new Data API router. This tutorial will cover configuring layouts and setting up protected routes.

<Steps>
  ### Install `react-router-dom`

  React Router's `react-router-dom` is a mature, battle tested routing package for React that gives you many options. As it is the most popular routing option, it will be used for this guide.

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn",  "pnpm" ]}>
    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install react-router-dom
    ```

    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add react-router-dom
    ```

    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add react-router-dom
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Create components for your routes

  The exact routes you will need depends on your application. For this guide, you will create `/`, `/contact`, `/dashboard`, `/sign-in`, and `sign-up` routes. The `/dashboard` route will contain a default route (`/dashbard/`) and an invoices route (`/dashboard/invoices`). The first step will be creating basic components for these routes.

  Use the tabs below to find the example components and recreate these files using the path from each tab.

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["Index", "Contact", "Sign-in", "Sign-up", "Dashboard",  "Invoices"]}>
    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'src/routes/index.tsx' }}
    import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

    export default function IndexPage() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>This is the index page</h1>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li><Link to="/sign-up">Sign Up</Link></li>
              <li><Link to="/sign-in">Sign In</Link></li>
              <li><Link to="/contact">Contact</Link></li>
              <li><Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```

    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'src/routes/contact.tsx' }}
    import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

    export default function ContactPage() {
      return (
        <>
          <h1>Contact</h1>
          <p>This is a public page meant to contain a contact form and other related contact details.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><Link to="/">Return to Index</Link></li>
            <li><Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link></li>
          </ul>
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'src/routes/sign-in.tsx' }}
    import { SignIn } from "@clerk/clerk-react"

    export default function SignInPage() {
      return <SignIn path="/sign-in" />;
    }
    ```

    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'src/routes/sign-up.tsx' }}
    import { SignUp } from "@clerk/clerk-react"

    export default function SignUpPage() {
      return <SignUp path="/sign-up" />;
    }
    ```

    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'src/routes/dashboard.tsx' }}
    import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

    export default function DashboardPage() {
      return (
        <>
          <h1>Dashboard page</h1>
          <p>This is a protected page.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><Link to="/dashboard/invoices">Invoices</Link></li>
            <li><Link to="/">Return to index</Link></li>
          </ul>
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'src/routes/dashboard.invoices.tsx' }}
    import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

    export default function InvoicesPage() {
      return (
        <>
          <h1>Invoices page</h1>
          <p>This is a protected page.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link></li>
            <li><Link to="/">Return to index</Link></li>
          </ul>
        </>
      );
    }
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Create layouts

  You're going to create two layouts for your application. One will mount [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) and act as a top level layout. It will also be a place for a header, footer, and other standard elements for your application.

  The second layout will be non-rendering and will protect everything in the `/dashboard` route. This avoids the need for per-page auth checks or for using Clerk's control components.

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["Root Layout", "Dashboard Layout"]}>
    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'src/layouts/root-layout.tsx' }}
    import { Link, Outlet, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'
    import { ClerkProvider, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

    const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

    if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
      throw new Error("Missing Publishable Key")
    }

    export default function RootLayout() {
      const navigate = useNavigate();

      return (
        <ClerkProvider
          routerPush={(to) => navigate(to)}
          routerReplace={(to) => navigate(to, { replace: true })}
          publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
        >
          <header className="header">
            <div>
              <div>
                <p>Clerk + React + React Router App</p>
              </div>
              <SignedIn>
                <UserButton />
              </SignedIn>
              <SignedOut>
                <Link to="/sign-in">Sign In</Link>
              </SignedOut>
            </div>
          </header>
          <main>
            <Outlet />
          </main>
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    }
    ```

    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'src/layouts/dashboard-layout.tsx' }}
    import * as React from 'react'
    import { useAuth } from "@clerk/clerk-react"
    import { Outlet, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom"

    export default function DashboardLayout() {
        const { userId, isLoaded } = useAuth()
        const navigate = useNavigate()

        console.log('test', userId)

        React.useEffect(() => {
            if (isLoaded && !userId) {
                navigate("/sign-in")
            }
        }, [isLoaded])

        if (!isLoaded) return "Loading..."

        return (
            <Outlet />
        )
    }
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  #### Key Takeaways

  - The new root-layout.tsx has a simple header that includes the `<UserButton />` and a link to the `/sign-in` page instead of a `<SignInButton />`. The rendering of these is controlled by the `<SignedIn>` and `<SignedOut>` control components. This is very similar to the [Embed the `<UserButton />` and `<SignInButton />`](/docs/quickstarts/react#embed-the-user-button-and-sign-in-button) step from the [React Quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/react).
  - Both the layouts contain an `<Outlet />` component from `react-router-dom`. This behaves similar to `{children}` in Next.js or more generic React components. You will take advantage of this component in the next step.

  ### Wire layouts and routes up with `createBrowserRouter`

  With all the routes and layouts you need created, you now need to wire up the layouts and the routes with the `createBrowserRouter` function from `react-router-dom`. This will use the Data API (aka Data Router) to configure your application.

  You can start by removing `src/App.tsx`—the contents of that file were moved to `src/layouts/root-layout.tsx`.

  In `src/main.tsx`, import `RouterProvider` and `createBrowserRouter()` from `react-router-dom`, as well as all of the default components from the layouts and routes you created. Replace the contents inside of `<React.StrictMode />` with only ` <RouterProvider router={router} />`. Lastly, you will build the `router` using `createBrowserRouter()`.

  ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'src/main.tsx' }}
  import React from 'react'
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
  import './index.css'
  import { RouterProvider, createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

  // Import the layouts
  import RootLayout from './layouts/root-layout'
  import DashboardLayout from './layouts/dashboard-layout'

  // Import the components
  import IndexPage from './routes'
  import ContactPage from './routes/contact'
  import SignInPage from './routes/sign-in'
  import SignUpPage from './routes/sign-up'
  import DashboardPage from './routes/dashboard'
  import InvoicesPage from './routes/dashboard.invoices'

  const router = createBrowserRouter([
    {
      element: <RootLayout />,
      children: [
        { path: "/", element: <IndexPage /> },
        { path: "/contact", element: <ContactPage /> },
        { path: "/sign-in/*", element: <SignInPage /> },
        { path: "/sign-up/*", element: <SignUpPage /> },
        {
          element: <DashboardLayout />,
          path: "dashboard",
          children: [
            { path: "/dashboard", element: <DashboardPage /> },
            { path: "/dashboard/invoices", element: <InvoicesPage /> }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ])

  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </React.StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

  #### Key Takeaways

  - The top most object in the `router` is the `<RootLayout />` component, and everything else is a child. Any child route will be mounted where the `<Outlet />` component is inside the root layout. This wraps the entire application with `<ClerkProvider>` and allows you to add a header, footer, sidebars and other pieces that will be available to the entire application.
  - Several routes are direct children of the root layout. These are all public routes. You can use control components like `<SignedIn>` or check the `userId` from `useAuth()` if you want to make content protected.
  - The `<DashboardLayout />` is child of the root layout, renders nothing, and has a check to see if the `userId` exists. This will confirm that a user is signed in. If the `userId` is not truthy, then the user will be redirected to the `/sign-in` route to sign-in. That protects all pages in the `/dashboard` route. All children of `/dashboard` will be mounted inside of the `<Outlet />` component in the dashboard layout.
</Steps>

Your application is setup with `react-router-dom` and ready for you to add more layouts and routes as needed! If you want to get started using a template from this guide, please clone the following repository and then checkout the `integrate-react-router-dom-using-data-router-method` branch.
