# `deleteEmailAddress()`

Deletes an [`EmailAddress`](/docs/references/javascript/email-address).

function deleteEmailAddress: (emailAddressId: string) => Promise<EmailAddress>;
```

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `emailAddressId` | `string` | The ID of the email address to delete. |

## Example

```tsx {{ prettier: false }}
const emailAddressId = 'idn_123';

const response = await clerkClient.emailAddresses.deleteEmailAddress(emailAddressId);

console.log(response);
/*
_DeletedObject {
  object: 'email_address',
  id: 'idn_123',
  slug: null,
  deleted: true
}
*/

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `DELETE/email_addresses/{email_address_id}`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Email-Addresses#operation/DeleteEmailAddress) for more details.
