Users are able to add multiple email addresses to their account. Adding an email address requires the user to verify the email address before it can be added to the user's account.

This guide demonstrates how to build a custom user interface that allows users to add and verify an email address for their account.

## Configure email verification

There are two verification methods available for email addresses:

- **Email verification code**: Users receive an email with an [OTP](!otp) to verify their email address.
- **Email verification link**: Users receive an email with a **link** to verify their email address.

By default, the verification method that is enabled is **email verification code**. To use email code verification, skip to the [Email code verification](#email-code-verification) section.

To use email links, you must configure the following settings in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. On the [**User & authentication**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/user-and-authentication) page of the Clerk Dashboard, in the **Email** tab, under the **Sign-in with email** section, enable the **Email verification link** option. By default, **Require the same device and browser** is enabled, which means that email links are required to be verified from the same device and browser on which the sign-up or sign-in was initiated. For this guide, leave this setting enabled.
1. Disable **Email verification code**.
1. Save your changes.

Then skip to the [Email link verification](#email-link-verification) section.
