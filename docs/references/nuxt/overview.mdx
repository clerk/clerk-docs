The Clerk Nuxt SDK gives you access to prebuilt components, composables, and helpers to make user authentication easier. Refer to the [quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) to get started.

## Integration

To configure Clerk with Nuxt, you must pass the `@clerk/nuxt` module to your Nuxt config in your `nuxt.config.ts` file. See the [reference](/docs/references/nuxt/integration) for more information on configuring the module, including setting Clerk options like `signInForceRedirectUrl`.

## Client-side helpers

Because the Nuxt SDK is built on top of the Clerk Vue SDK, you can use the composables that the Vue SDK provides. These composables include access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk) object, [`User` object](/docs/references/javascript/user), [`Organization` object](/docs/references/javascript/organization), and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. Learn more in the [Vue SDK reference](/docs/references/vue/overview).

## `Auth` object

The `Auth` object is available at `event.context.auth()` in your [event handlers](https://h3.unjs.io/guide/event-handler). This JavaScript object contains important information like session data, your user's ID, as well as their organization ID. [Learn more](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object).

## `clerkMiddleware()`

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication and authorization into your Nuxt application through middleware. [Learn more](/docs/references/nuxt/clerk-middleware).

## `clerkClient()`

The `clerkClient()` helper returns an instance of the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/getting-started/quickstart). [Learn more](/docs/guides/users/reading).

## Protect pages and API routes

To protect pages, use the `useAuth()` helper to protect a single page, or use it with `defineNuxtRouteMiddleware()` alongside the `createRouteMatcher()` helper to protect multiple pages. [Learn more](/docs/guides/secure/protect-pages).

To protect API routes (`/api/**`), use the `clerkMiddleware()` helper. [Learn more](/docs/references/nuxt/clerk-middleware).

> [!QUIZ]
> When protecting pages/routes using middleware, what is the difference between using `defineNuxtRouteMiddleware()` and `clerkMiddleware()`? Why not use one or the other?
>
> ---
>
> `defineNuxtRouteMiddleware()` is used to protect pages only and cannot protect API routes. `clerkMiddleware()` is used to protect API routes. It can protect pages, **but on initial page reload only**. On subsequent navigations, it won't be triggered because client-side navigation will bypass the middleware.
