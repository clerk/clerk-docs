# `createOrganizationMembership()`

Creates a membership to an organization for a user directly (circumventing the need for an invitation).

```tsx {{ prettier: false }}
function createOrganizationMembership: (params: CreateOrganizationMembershipParams) => Promise<OrganizationMembership>;
```

## `CreateOrganizationMembershipParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `organizationId` | `string` | The organization ID of the organization a user is being added to. |
| `userId` | `string` | The user ID of the user being added to the organization. |
| `role` | `string` | The [role](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions) to assign the added user within the organization. |

## Example

In the following example, an [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-organization-membership) is created for a user with the role `org:member`.

```tsx {{ prettier: false }}
const organizationId = 'org_123';

const userId = 'user_123';

const role = 'org:member';

const response = await clerkClient.organizations.createOrganizationMembership({ organizationId, userId, role });

console.log(response);
/*
_OrganizationMembership {
  id: 'orgmem_123',
  role: 'org:member',
  publicMetadata: {},
  privateMetadata: {},
  createdAt: 1705534546701,
  updatedAt: 1705534546701,
  organization: _Organization {
    id: 'org_123',
    name: 'TestOrg',
    slug: 'test-org',
    imageUrl: 'https://img.clerk.com/eyJ...',
    hasImage: false,
    createdBy: 'user_456',
    createdAt: 1702488558853,
    updatedAt: 1705534260298,
    publicMetadata: {},
    privateMetadata: {},
    maxAllowedMemberships: 3,
    adminDeleteEnabled: true,
    members_count: undefined
  },
  publicUserData: _OrganizationMembershipPublicUserData {
    identifier: 'testclerk123@gmail.com',
    firstName: 'Test',
    lastName: 'Clerk',
    imageUrl: 'https://img.clerk.com/eyJ...',
    hasImage: true,
    userId: 'user_123'
  }
}
*/
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `POST/organizations/{organization_id}/memberships`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organization-Memberships#operation/CreateOrganizationMembership) for more details.
