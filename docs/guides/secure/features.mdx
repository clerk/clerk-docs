Features are specific capabilities or functionalities in your application that you want to control access to. They are used in [authorization checks](!authorization-check).

Features can be used in two ways:

- With Clerk's [organizations](/docs/guides/organizations/overview) feature to create custom permissions. Custom permissions are always tied to a feature, and are formatted as `org:<feature>:<permission>`. For example, you could create a feature called **invoices** and then create a new permission called **create invoices**. The custom permission's key would be `org:invoices:create`. Learn more about [custom permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions).
- With Clerk's billing feature to create features specific to a subscription plan. See the [billing docs](/docs/guides/billing/overview) for more information.

To manage your features, navigate to the [**Features**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/features) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
