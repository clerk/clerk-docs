Authorization condition for the `when` prop in `<Show />`.
Can be an object specifying role, permission, feature, or plan,
or a callback function receiving the `has` helper for complex conditions.

Note: Unlike `ProtectParams`, this excludes the `condition` variant since
`<Show />` expects functions to be passed directly to `when`, not wrapped
in `{ condition: fn }`.
