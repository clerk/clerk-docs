## Setting up Clerk Node.js

<Steps>

### Create a Clerk application

You need to create a Clerk application in your Clerk Dashboard before you can set up Clerk Node.js. For more information, check out our [Set up your application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) guide.

### Install Clerk Node.js

Once a Clerk application has been created, you can install and then start using Clerk Node.js in your application. An ES module for the Clerk Node SDK is available under the [`@clerk/clerk-sdk-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clerk/clerk-sdk-node) npm package.

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
```sh filename="terminal"
npm install @clerk/clerk-sdk-node
```

```sh filename="terminal"
yarn add @clerk/clerk-sdk-node
```

```sh filename="terminal"
pnpm add @clerk/clerk-sdk-node
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment variables

Below is an example of an `.env.local` file.

**Pro tip!** If you are signed into your Clerk Dashboard, your secret key should become visible by clicking on the eye icon. Otherwise, you can find your keys in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.

<InjectKeys>

```env filename=".env.local"
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
```

</InjectKeys>

</Steps>

## Resources

All resource operations are mounted as sub-APIs on the `clerkClient` object. For more information, check out the [Clerk Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) documentation.

## Customizing resources

The following options are available for you to customize the behaviour of the `clerkClient` object.

<Callout type="info">
  Most options can also be set as environment variables so that you don't need to pass anything to the constructor or set it via the available setters.
</Callout>

| Option | Description | Default | Environment variable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `secretKey` | Server key for `api.clerk.com` | none | `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` |
| `apiVersion` | for future use, `v1` for now | `v1` | `CLERK_API_VERSION` |
| `serverApiURL` | for debugging / future use | `https://api.clerk.com` | `CLERK_API_URL` |
| `httpOptions` | http client options | `{}` | N/A |

For every option the resolution is as follows, in order of descending precedence:

- option passed
- environment variable (if applicable)
- default

Another available environment variable is `CLERK_LOGGING`. You can set its value to `true` to enable additional logging that may be of use when debugging an issue.

### Singleton

If you are comfortable with setting the `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variable and being finished, the default instance created by the SDK will suffice for your needs.

<Tabs items={["ESM", "CJS"]}>
  <Tab>
  ```js
  import clerkClient from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

  const userList = await clerkClient.users.getUserList();
  ```

  Or if you are interested only in a certain resource:

  ```js
  import { sessions } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

  const sessionList = await sessions.getSessionList();
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
  ```js
  const pkg = require('@clerk/clerk-sdk-node');
  const clerkClient = pkg.default;

  clerkClient.emails
    .createEmail({ fromEmailName, subject, body, emailAddressId })
    .then((email) => console.log(email))
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  ```

  Or if you prefer a resource sub-api directly:

  ```js
  const pkg = require('@clerk/clerk-sdk-node');
  const { clients } = pkg;

  clients
    .getClient(clientId)
    .then((client) => console.log(client))
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Setters

The following setters are available for you to change the options even after you've obtained a handle on a `clerkClient` or sub-api instance:

If you have a `clerkClient` handle:

- `clerkClient.secretKey = value;`
- `clerkClient.serverApiUrl = value;`
- `clerkClient.apiVersion = value;`
- `clerkClient.httpOptions = value;` (deprecated)

If are using a sub-api handle and wish to change options on the (implicit) singleton `clerkClient` instance:

- `setClerkSecretKey(value)`
- `setClerkServerApiUrl(value)`
- `setClerkApiVersion(value)`
- `setClerkHttpOptions(value)`

### Custom instantiation

If you would like to customize the behavior of the SDK, you can instantiate a `clerkClient` instance yourself by passing in [options](#customizing-resources).

The example below shows how to create a `clerkClient` instance and pass a Clerk secret key instead of setting a `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.

<InjectKeys>

<CodeBlockTabs options={["ESM", "CJS"]}>
```js
import Clerk from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node/esm/instance';

const clerkClient = Clerk({ secretKey: '{{secret}}' });

const clientList = await clerkClient.clients.getClientList();
```

```js
const Clerk = require('@clerk/clerk-sdk-node/cjs/instance').default;

const clerkClient = Clerk({ secretKey: '{{secret}}' });

clerkClient.emails
    .createEmail({ fromEmailName, subject, body, emailAddressId })
    .then((email) => console.log(email))
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

</InjectKeys>

## Multi-session applications

If Clerk is running in multi-session mode, it's important to ensure your frontend sends the Session ID that is making the request.

Our middleware will look for a query string parameter named `_clerk_session_id`. If this parameter is not found, the middleware will instead choose the last active session, which may be subject to race conditions and should not be relied on for authenticating actions.

## Connect/Express middlewares

The Clerk Node SDK offers two [middlewares](/docs/backend-requests/handling/nodejs) to authenticate your backend endpoints.

## Manual authentication

### Authenticate a particular session

```js
import { sessions } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';
import Cookies from 'cookies';

// Retrieve the particular session ID from a
// query string parameter
const sessionId = req.query._clerk_session_id;

// Note: Clerk stores the clientToken in a cookie
// named "__session" for Firebase compatibility
const cookies = new Cookies(req, res);
const clientToken = cookies.get('__session');

const session = await sessions.verifySession(sessionId, clientToken);
```

### Authenticate the last active session

Using the last active session is appropriate when determining the user after a navigation.

```js
import { clients, sessions } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';
import Cookies from 'cookies';

// Note: Clerk stores the clientToken in a cookie
// named "__session" for Firebase compatibility
const cookies = new Cookies(req, res);
const clientToken = cookies.get('__session');

const client = await clients.verifyClient(clientToken);
const sessionId = client.lastActiveSessionId;

const session = await sessions.verifySession(sessionId, clientToken);
```
