**Keyless Mode** allows you to try out Clerk in your local development environment without having to sign-up for a Clerk account.

## How does it work?

If Clerk's SDK doesn't detect valid [Clerk keys](TODO) in your environment, it will automatically fetch a set of keys for you. These keys are associated with a Clerk development instance that has a default configuration. When running locally in Keyless Mode, you'll see a banner indicating that you're running in this special mode with a link to claim your instance by signing up for a Clerk account, or signing in if you already have one.

Keys are written to a file in your project's `.clerk` directory. Ensure that this directory is added your `.gitignore` file to prevent keys from being committed to your repository.

### Default configuration

Clerk development instances have the following default configuration:

- **Authentication**: Email and password, Sign-in with Google
- **Verification**: Email verification is required
- **Password reset**: Password reset is enabled
- **MFA**: MFA is disabled
- **Appearance**: Default appearance

When using Clerk in Keyless Mode, you're not able to make configuration changes to your instance. To make changes, [claim your instance](#claiming-keyless-keys).

## Keyless Mode support

Keyless mode works with Clerk's SDKs for [Next.js](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs), [Remix](/docs/quickstarts/remix), and [Tanstack Start](/docs/quickstarts/tanstack-start). If you're using a different framework or SDk, you'll need to manually configure Clerk keys in your environment. Visit the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up) to create an account, create an instance and get your keys.

Keyless mode _may_ work in other environments, but it's not officially supported.

## Claiming keyless keys

When you're ready to make configuration changes to your instance, you can claim the keys that were created automatically. To do this, click the "Claim your instance" button in the Clerk toolbar on your localhost. You'll then be prompted to sign-up for a Clerk account, or sign-in if you already have one. From there, you can give your Clerk application a name and the keys will be associated with your account.

You'll need to copy and paste the keys into your `.env` file to persist them in your project. This will disable Keyless mode.
