The Clerk Fastify SDK provides a powerful set of tools and utilities to seamlessly integrate authentication, user management, and organization management into your Fastify application. Refer to the [quickstart guide](/docs/fastify/getting-started/quickstart) to get started.

## `clerkPlugin()`

The `clerkPlugin()` function is required to integrate Clerk's authentication into your application. The function checks request cookies and headers for a session JWT. If valid, it attaches the [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }} object to the `request` object under the `auth` key. See the [reference doc](/docs/reference/fastify/clerk-plugin) for more information.

## `getAuth()`

The `getAuth()` helper retrieves the current user's authentication state from the `request` object. It returns the [`Auth` object](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }}, which includes helpful authentication information like the user's ID, session ID, and organization ID. It's also useful for protecting routes. See the [reference doc](/docs/reference/fastify/get-auth) for more information.
