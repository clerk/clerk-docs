  - Create a JWT template in Clerk to generate Convex JWTs
  - Configure Convex to accept JWTs from Clerk
  - Configure the Clerk and Convex providers to work together
</TutorialHero>

With [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/), you can build a backend with a provided realtime database, file storage, text search, scheduling and more. Paired with Clerk's user authentication and management features, you can build a powerful application with minimal effort. This tutorial will show you how to integrate Clerk into your Convex application. It assumes that you have already integrated one of Clerk's SDKs into your application.

<Steps>
  ## Create a JWT template based on Convex

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**JWT templates**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=jwt-templates) page.
  1. Select **New template** and then from the list of templates, select **Convex**. You'll be redirected to the template's settings page.
  1. Copy and save the **Issuer** URL somewhere secure. This URL is the issuer domain for Clerk's JWT templates, which is your application's **Frontend API URL**. In development, it's format will be `https://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev`. In production, it's format will be `https://clerk.<your-domain>.com`.

  ## Map additional claims (optional)

  In the **Claims** section, the default audience (`aud`) claim required by Convex is pre-mapped, as well as some other helpful claims like Convex's `name` claim to Clerk's `user.full_name` claim. You can include additional claims as necessary. [Shortcodes](/docs/backend-requests/jwt-templates#shortcodes) are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.

  ## Configure Convex with the Clerk issuer domain

  1. In your `env` file, add your **Issuer** URL as the `CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL` environment variable. If you already have it set, great!
     ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
     CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL={{fapi_url}}
     ```
  1. In your app's `convex` folder, add an `auth.config.js` file with the following configuration:
     ```ts {{ filename: 'convex/auth.config.js' }}
     export default {
       providers: [
         {
           domain: process.env.CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN,
           applicationID: 'convex',
         },
       ],
     }
     ```

  ## Deploy your changes to Convex

  Run `npx convex dev` to automatically sync your configuration to your backend.

  ## Configure the Clerk and Convex providers

  Both Clerk and Convex have provider components that are required to provide authentication and client context. You should already have Clerk's provider component, `<ClerkProvider>`, in your app. Convex offers a provider that is specifically for integrating with Clerk called `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>`.

  <Tabs items={["Next.js", "React"]}>
    <Tab>
      You're going to use the `ConvexClientProvider` in your `app/layout.tsx` file, which is a Server Component. `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>` must be a Client Component, as it uses the `useAuth()` hook, but you can't use a Client Component in a Server Component. To solve this, you must first create a wrapper component that will be used to wrap `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>`.

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'components/ConvexClientProvider.tsx' }}
      'use client'

      import { ReactNode } from 'react'
      import { ConvexReactClient } from 'convex/react'
      import { ConvexProviderWithClerk } from 'convex/react-clerk'
      import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      if (!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL) {
        throw new Error('Missing NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL in your .env file')
      }

      const convex = new ConvexReactClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL)

      export default function ConvexClientProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
        return (
          <ConvexProviderWithClerk client={convex} useAuth={useAuth}>
            {children}
          </ConvexProviderWithClerk>
        )
      }
      ```

      Now, you can use the `ConvexClientProvider` in your `app/layout.tsx` file. Clerk's `<ClerkProvider>` must be wrapped around it.

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx', mark: [5, 31] }}
      import type { Metadata } from 'next'
      import { Geist, Geist_Mono } from 'next/font/google'
      import './globals.css'
      import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
      import ConvexClientProvider from '@/components/ConvexClientProvider'

      const geistSans = Geist({
        variable: '--font-geist-sans',
        subsets: ['latin'],
      })

      const geistMono = Geist_Mono({
        variable: '--font-geist-mono',
        subsets: ['latin'],
      })

      export const metadata: Metadata = {
        title: 'Clerk Next.js Quickstart',
        description: 'Generated by create next app',
      }

      export default function RootLayout({
        children,
      }: Readonly<{
        children: React.ReactNode
      }>) {
        return (
          <html lang="en">
            <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>
              <ClerkProvider>
                <ConvexClientProvider>{children}</ConvexClientProvider>
              </ClerkProvider>
            </body>
          </html>
        )
      }
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      The following example demonstrates how to configure Clerk and Convex's providers. Clerk's [`useAuth()`](/docs/hooks/use-auth) hook must be passed to Convex's `<ConvexProviderWithClerk>` and Clerk's `<ClerkProvider>` must be wrapped around it.

      ```ts {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [[5, 7], 19, 21] }}
      import React from 'react'
      import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
      import App from './App.tsx'
      import './index.css'
      import { ClerkProvider, useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-react'
      import { ConvexProviderWithClerk } from 'convex/react-clerk'
      import { ConvexReactClient } from 'convex/react'

      // Import your Publishable Key
      const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

      if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
        throw new Error('Add your Clerk Publishable Key to the .env file')
      }

      ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
        <React.StrictMode>
          <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY} afterSignOutUrl="/">
            <ConvexProviderWithClerk client={convex} useAuth={useAuth}>
              <App />
            </ConvexProviderWithClerk>
          </ClerkProvider>
        </React.StrictMode>,
      )
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Steps>

## Next steps

Be aware that Convex may require usage of their custom hooks and methods rather than Clerk's, such as using Convex's `useConvexAuth()` hook instead of Clerk's `useAuth()` hook in some cases. For more information on how to use Convex with Clerk, see the [Convex docs](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk).
