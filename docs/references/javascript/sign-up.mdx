title: '`SignUp`'
description: The SignUp object holds the state of the current sign-up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-up flow. Once a sign-up is complete, a new user is created.
---

The `SignUp` object holds the state of the current sign-up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-up process. Once a sign-up is complete, a new user is created.

The following steps outline the sign-up process:

1. Initiate the sign-up process by collecting the user's authentication information and passing the appropriate parameters to the [`create()`](#create) method.
1. Prepare the [verification](#verification).
1. Attempt to complete the verification.
1. If the verification is successful, set the newly created session as the active session by passing the `SignIn.createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object.

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `id`
  - `string | undefined`

  The unique identifier of the current sign-up.

  ---

  - `status`
  - `'missing_requirements' | 'complete' | 'abandoned' | null`

  The status of the current sign-up. The following values are supported:

  - `complete:` The user has been created and the custom flow can proceed to `setActive()` to create session.
  - `missing_requirements:` A requirement is unverified or missing from the [**Email, Phone, Username**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) settings. For example, in the Clerk Dashboard, the **Password** setting is required but a password wasn't provided in the custom flow.
  - `abandoned:` The sign-up has been inactive for over 24 hours.

  ---

  - `requiredFields`
  - `string[]`

  An array of all the required fields that need to be supplied and verified in order for this sign-up to be marked as complete and converted into a user.

```

### `create()`

Returns a new `SignUp` object based on the `params` you pass to it, stores the sign-up lifecycle state in the `status` property, and deactivates any existing sign-up process the client may already have in progress. Use this method to initiate a new sign-up process.

What you must pass to `params` depends on which [sign-up options](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options) you have enabled in your Clerk application instance.

Optionally, you can complete the sign-up process in one step if you supply the required fields to `create()`. Otherwise, Clerk's sign-up process provides great flexibility and allows users to easily create multi-step sign-up flows.

> [!WARNING]
> Once the sign-up process is complete, pass the `createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object. This will set the newly created session as the active session.

### `prepareWeb3WalletVerification()`

Initiates a verification process for a Web3 wallet by sending the wallet address to the server and retrieving a nonce that must be cryptographically signed by the wallet. This is a convenience method that wraps [`SignUp.prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification) with Web3 wallet strategies.

By default, this method is equivalent to calling `SignUp.prepareVerification({ strategy: 'web3_metamask_signature' })`. The verification process will fail if the wallet address is invalid or has already been verified. The returned nonce has a limited validity period and can only be used once.

```typescript
function prepareWeb3WalletVerification(
  params?: PrepareWeb3WalletVerificationParams,
): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### `PrepareWeb3WalletVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'web3_metamask_signature'` | `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'` | `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`

  The verification strategy to validate the user's sign-up request. The following strategies are supported:

  - `'web3_metamask_signature'`: User will need to sign a message and generate a signature using MetaMask browser extension.
  - `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'`: User will need to sign a message and generate a signature using Coinbase Wallet.
  - `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`: User will need to sign a message and generate a signature using OKX Wallet.
</Properties>

### `update()`

Updates the current `SignUp`.

```typescript
function update(params: SignUpUpdateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### `SignUpUpdateParams`

`SignUpUpdateParams` is a mirror of [`SignUpCreateParams`](#sign-up-create-params) with the same fields and types, depending on the configuration of the instance.
