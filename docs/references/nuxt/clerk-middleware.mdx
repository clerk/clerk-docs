description: The clerkMiddleware() helper allows you to protect your Nuxt application using middleware.
---

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper allows you to protect your Nuxt application **on the server-side**. It can be used to validate a user's authentication status or authorization status.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn how to protect pages, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/references/nuxt/protect-pages).

## Configure `clerkMiddleware()`

By default, the Nuxt SDK **automatically** adds the `clerkMiddleware()` helper to your Nuxt application.

To **manually** configure the middleware:

1. In your `nuxt.config.ts` file, under the `clerk` property, set `skipServerMiddleware: true`.

   ```ts {{ filename: 'nuxt.config.ts', mark: [[3, 5]] }}
   export default defineNuxtConfig({
     modules: ['@clerk/nuxt'],
     clerk: {
       skipServerMiddleware: true,
     },
   })
   ```
1. In your `server/middleware/` directory, create a file named `clerk.ts` with the following code:

   ```ts {{ filename: 'server/middleware/clerk.ts' }}
   import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'
   export default clerkMiddleware()
   ```

## `createRouteMatcher()`

`createRouteMatcher()` is a Clerk helper function that allows you to protect multiple server routes. `createRouteMatcher()` accepts an array of route patterns and checks if an incoming server request matches any of these patterns.

The `createRouteMatcher()` helper returns a function that, if called with the `event` object from an event handler, will return `true` if the request URL matches one of the patterns passed to `createRouteMatcher()`.

In the following example, `createRouteMatcher()` sets all `/api/billing` and `/projects` server routes as protected routes.

```ts
const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/api/invoices(.*)', '/projects(.*)'])
```

## Protect API routes

You can protect routes using either or both of the following:

- [Authentication-based protection](#authentication-based-protection): Verify if the user is signed in.
- [Authorization-based protection](#authorization-based-protection): Verify if the user has the required organization roles or custom permissions.

### Authentication-based protection

To protect routes based on user authentication status, you can check if the user is signed in by checking the `userId` on the [`auth`](/docs/references/nuxt/overview#auth-object) object.

In the following example, the `clerkMiddleware()` helper checks if the user is signed in and accessing a protected route. If they aren't signed in, an error is thrown using Nuxt's [`createError()`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/create-error) utility.

```tsx {{ filename: 'server/middleware/clerk.ts' }}
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

export default clerkMiddleware((event) => {
  const { userId } = event.context.auth

  const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/api/invoices(.*)', '/projects(.*)'])

  if (!userId && isProtectedRoute(event)) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 401,
      statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: User not signed in',
    })
  }
})
```

### Authorization-based protection

To protect routes based on user authorization status, you can use the `has()` helper to check if the user has the required [organization roles or custom permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions). It is available on the [`auth`](/docs/references/nuxt/overview#auth-object) object.

#### Protecting routes using custom permissions

In the following example, the `clerkMiddleware()` helper checks if the user is accessing a protected route. If so, it checks if the user has the required custom permission. If they don't, an error is thrown using Nuxt's [`createError()`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/create-error) utility.

```ts {{ filename: 'server/middleware/clerk.ts' }}
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

export default clerkMiddleware((event) => {
  const { has } = event.context.auth

  const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/api/admin(.*)'])

  const canCreateInvoices = has({
    permission: 'org:invoices:create',
  })

  // Check if user is accessing sensitive customer data
  if (isProtectedRoute(event)) {
    // Check if user has the required permission
    if (!canCreateInvoices) {
      throw createError({
        statusCode: 403,
        statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: Missing permission to create invoices',
      })
    }
  }
})
```

#### Protecting routes using default roles

> [!WARNING]
> It's best practice to use permission-based authorization over role-based authorization, as it reduces complexity and increases security. Usually, complex role checks can be refactored with a single permission check.

In the following example, the `clerkMiddleware()` helper checks if the user is accessing a protected route. If so, it checks if the user has the required admin role. If they don't, an error is thrown using Nuxt's [`createError()`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/create-error) utility.

```ts {{ filename: 'server/middleware/clerk.ts' }}
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

export default clerkMiddleware((event) => {
  const { has } = event.context.auth

  const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/api/admin(.*)'])

  const isAdmin = has({
    role: 'org:admin',
  })

  // Check if the user is trying to access a protected route
  if (isProtectedRoute(event)) {
    // Check if the user has the required admin role
    if (!isAdmin) {
      throw createError({
        statusCode: 403,
        statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: Admin access required',
      })
    }
  }
})
```
