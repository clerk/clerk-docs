Retrieves a list of memberships for an Organization. Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/reference/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) object with a `data` property that contains an array of [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization-membership) objects, and a `totalCount` property that indicates the total number of organization memberships in the system for the specified Organization.

```ts
function getOrganizationMembershipList(
  params: GetOrganizationMembershipListParams,
): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<OrganizationMembership[]>>
```

## `GetOrganizationMembershipListParams`

### `getOrganizationMembershipList({ organizationId, limit })`

Retrieves Organization membership list that is filtered by the number of results.

  limit: 10,

```

### `getOrganizationMembershipList({ organizationId, offset })`

Retrieves Organization membership list that is filtered by the number of results to skip.

```tsx

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/organizations/{organization_id}/memberships`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/organization-memberships/get/organizations/\{organization_id}/memberships){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
