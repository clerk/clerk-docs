title: Clerk MCP server
description: Connect AI agents to Clerk's MCP server to get SDK snippets and patterns.
---

Clerk provides a remote [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that allows AI agents like Claude, Cursor, and Github Copilot to access Clerk SDK snippets and implementation patterns. This provides AI agents with up-to-date code examples when developing with Clerk.

The Clerk MCP server provides:

- **SDK snippets**: Ready-to-use code patterns for common Clerk features
- **Implementation guides**: Best practices for authentication flows, organizations, and more
- **Framework-specific examples**: Patterns optimized for Next.js, React, and other supported frameworks

## Setup instructions


- **URL**: `https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp`

### Cursor

To add the MCP server to Cursor, you can install by clicking [here](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Clerk\&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5jbGVyay5jb20vbWNwIn0=), or searching for Clerk from Cursor's [MCP tools page](https://cursor.directory).

Alternatively, you can manually configure it:

1. Navigate to **Cursor Settings**. To find this, open the **Command Palette** (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`) and search for **Cursor Settings**, or select the gear icon in the top right corner of the app.
2. In the sidenav, select **Tools & Integrations**.
3. Click the **New MCP Server** button to open the MCP configuration JSON file.
4. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clerk": {
      "url": "https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

5. Once added, you should see a green active status.

### Codex

**Configuration via CLI:**

Run the following command in Terminal:

```bash
codex mcp add clerk --transport http https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp
```

> [!NOTE]
> If this is the first time you are using an MCP in Codex, you will need to enable the `rmcp` feature. Add the following into your `~/.codex/config.toml`:
>
> ```toml
> [beta]
> rmcp = true
> ```

**Configuration through config file:**

1. Open the `~/.codex/config.toml` file in your preferred editor.
2. Add the following:

```toml
[mcp_servers.clerk]
type = "url"
url = "https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp"
```

### Other clients

Many other tools now support MCP servers. The easiest way is to use our streamable HTTP endpoint: `https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp`.

## Available tools

The Clerk MCP server provides the following tools:

| Tool | Description |
| - | - |
| `clerk_sdk_snippet` | Get SDK code snippets and patterns for specific features |
