The Clerk Ruby SDK provides a seamless integration with Sinatra through a dedicated extension that gives you access to authentication, user management, and Organization management features.

<Steps>
  ## Install `clerk-sdk-ruby`

  <Include src="_partials/ruby/installation" />

  ## Configuration

  <Include src="_partials/ruby/configuration" />

  ## Add Clerk's Sinatra extension

  The `clerk` object provides access to the [Ruby SDK's available methods](/docs/reference/ruby/overview#available-methods). To get access to the `clerk` object, you must `register` the `Sinatra::Clerk` extension.

  The following example demonstrates how to register the `Sinatra::Clerk` extension and access the user's [`User`](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-http-client-ruby/blob/main/.generated/docs/User.md) object.

  ```ruby {{ filename: 'app.rb' }}
  require "clerk/sinatra"
  require "sinatra/base"

  class App < Sinatra::Base
    register Sinatra::Clerk

    # Access the user's `User` object
    get "/" do
      @user = clerk.user
      erb :index, format: :html5
    end

    run! if app_file == $0
  end
  ```
</Steps>

## Example: Protect routes

The `auth` filter can be added to any route to protect it from unauthenticated users. If a user is not authenticated, by default, `auth` will redirect them to the sign-in page.

```ruby
require "clerk/sinatra"
require "sinatra/base"

class App < Sinatra::Base
  register Sinatra::Clerk

  get "/" do
    erb :index, format: :html5
  end

  # Protect the "/admin" route with the `auth` filter
  # If the user is not authenticated, they will be redirected to the sign-in page
  get "/admin", auth: true do
    @user = clerk.user
    erb :admin, format: :html5
  end

  run! if app_file == $0
end
```

### Override the default behavior of the `auth` filter

By default, the `auth` filter will redirect to the sign-in page if the user is not authenticated. You can override this behavior by using `set(:auth)`.

In the following example, the `auth` filter is overridden to redirect to the homepage if the user is not authenticated.

```ruby {{ filename: 'app.rb' }}
require "clerk/sinatra"
require "sinatra/base"

class App < Sinatra::Base
  register Sinatra::Clerk

  # Set `auth` to perform custom behavior
  set(:auth) do |active|
    condition do
      # If the user is not authenticated, redirect to the homepage
      if active && !clerk.session
        puts "User is not authenticated, redirecting to the homepage"
        redirect '/'
      end
    end
  end

  get "/" do
    erb :index, format: :html5
  end

  # Protect the "/admin" route with the `auth` filter
  # which will perform the custom behavior set in `set(:auth)`
  get "/admin", auth: true do
    @user = clerk.user
    erb :admin, format: :html5
  end

  run! if app_file == $0
end
```

## Example: Reverification

For actions requiring additional security, Clerk provides a `reverify` filter that prompts users to re-authenticate. This filter accepts an optional [preset](/docs/reference/ruby/overview#reverification) parameter to customize the reverification requirements.

In the following example, the `/super-secret-admin` or `/chill-admin` routes will be protected from unauthenticated users. If the user is authenticated, they will be required to reverify their session, depending on when they last verified their session.

```ruby
require "clerk/sinatra"
require "sinatra/base"

class App < Sinatra::Base
  register Sinatra::Clerk

  get "/" do
    erb :index, format: :html5
  end

  # Protect the "/super-secret-admin" route with the `auth` and `reverify` filters
  # Reverification preset defaults to `STRICT`
  post "/super-secret-admin", auth: true, reverify: true do
    {message: clerk.user? ? "Valid session" : "Not logged in"}.to_json
  end

  # Protect the "/chill-admin" route with the `auth` and `reverify` filters
  # Reverification preset is set to `LAX`
  post "/chill-admin", auth: true, reverify: Clerk::StepUp::Preset::LAX do
    {message: clerk.user? ? "Valid session" : "Not logged in"}.to_json
  end

  run! if app_file == $0
end
```
