</TutorialHero>

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs â€” no other configuration is needed.

To configure your development instance, follow these steps:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select the **Add connection** button and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **LinkedIn**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

In _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials, which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your LinkedIn Developer account.

To configure your production instance, follow these steps:

  ### Enable LinkedIn as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **LinkedIn**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Create a LinkedIn application

  > [!TIP]
  > If you already have a LinkedIn app you'd like to connect to Clerk, select your app from the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/) and skip to [the next step in this tutorial](#get-your-client-id-and-client-secret).

  1. On the homepage of the [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/), select **Create app**. You'll be taken to the **Create an app** form.
  1. Fill out the form as follows:
     1. Under _App name_, name the application whatever you'd like. "Clerk Demo App", for example.
     1. Under **LinkedIn Page**, paste the URL of the LinkedIn page you'd like to associate with the application.
     1. Under **App logo**, upload an image to represent the application.
     1. Under **Legal agreement**, select the checkbox to agree to LinkedIn's API Terms of Use.
     1. Finally, select **Create app**. You'll be redirected to the app's dashboard.
  1. Select the **Auth** tab.
  1. Under **Application credentials**, save the **Client ID** and **Primary Client Secret** somewhere secure. These are your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in Clerk, respectively.
  1. Under the **OAuth 2.0 settings** section, next to **Authorized redirect URLs for your app**, select the **Edit** icon.
  1. Select **Add redirect URL** and paste the **Redirect URI** you copied from the Clerk Dashboard.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  ### Enable OpenID Connect in your LinkedIn application

  1. Select the **Products** tab.
  1. Next to **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect**, select **Request access**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you need to ensure the longevity of the user's access token without the need for re-authentication, make sure to obtain approval as a [Marketing Developer Platform (MDP) partner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/quick-start?view=li-lms-2023-10#step-1-apply-for-api-access). This is not required if you don't directly interact with the LinkedIn API using the access token.

  ### Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/test-your-connection" />
