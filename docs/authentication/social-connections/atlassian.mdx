  - Use Atlassian to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with Atlassian allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Atlassian account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Atlassian**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Atlassian Developer console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Atlassian as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Atlassian**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Callback URL** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Create an Atlassian workspace

  > [!TIP]
  > If you already have an Atlassian workspace you'd like to connect to Clerk, select your workspace from the [Atlassian Developer console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/) and skip to [the next step in this tutorial](#configure-your-atlassian-app).

  1. In the [Atlassian Developer console](https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/), next to **My apps**, select **Create**. Then, select **OAuth 2.0 integration**. You'll be redirected to the **Create a new OAuth 2.0 (3LO) integration** page.
  1. Fill out the necessary information. Then, select **Create**. Once the integration is created, you'll be redirected to the app's **Overview** page.

  ### Configure your Atlassian app

  1. In the left sidenav of your app's **Overview** page, select **Permissions**. Configure the OAuth 2.0 scopes to request from your users when they connect with Atlassian. At a minimum, next to **User identity API**, select **Add**.
  1. In the left sidenav, select **Authorization**.
  1. Next to **OAuth 2.0 (3LO)**, select **Add**.
  1. In the **Callback URL** field, paste the **Callback URL** you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Save changes**.
  1. In the left sidenav, select **Settings**.
  1. Under **Authentication details**, save the **Client ID** and **Secret** somewhere secure.
  1. In the left sidenav, select **Distribution**.
  1. Select **Edit**.
  1. Set the **Distribution Status** to **Sharing**.
  1. Complete the required fields. For **Does your app store personal data?**, select **Yes**, as Clerk uses the user's personal data to authenticate them.
  1. Select **Save changes**.

  ### Set the Client ID and Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ### Test your connection

  > [!WARNING]
  > To be able to connect, the user must have access to at least one Atlassian site (e.g. JIRA, Confluence). Currently, the user can authorize access only to a single Atlassian site.

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/test-your-connection" />
