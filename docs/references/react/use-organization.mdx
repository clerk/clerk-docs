# `useOrganization()`

The `useOrganization()` hook gives you access to the current active organization attributes.

```jsx
const { 
  isLoaded,
  organization,
  membership,
  invitationList,
  memberships,
  membershipRequest,
  domains,
} = useOrganization(useOrganizationParams);
```

<Callout type="info">
  These attributes are updating automatically and will re-render their respective components whenever you set a different organization using the [`setActive({ organization })`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods#set-active) method or update any of the memberships or invitations. No need for you to manage updating anything manually.
</Callout>

### Expanding and paginating attributes

To keep network usage to a minimum but to also provide a smooth auto-updating experience to developers, we made the `invitationList` attribute available only when its respective parameter is present when calling the hook.

```jsx
const { invitationList } = useOrganization();
// invitationList is undefined.

const { invitationList } = useOrganization({ 
 invitationList: {} // Add any pagination params you might need.
});
// invitationList is retrieved and auto-updating as expected.
```

In addition, we support a paginated response with page fetching helper functions for `memberships`, `membershipRequests`, and `domains`. See [usage](#usage) below for an example.

## Usage

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure you've followed the installation guide for [Clerk React](/docs/references/react/overview) before running the snippets below.
</Callout>

In the following example, `useOrganization()` is used to map over the `memberships` of the current active organization and present membership attributes. In addition, buttons support navigating through the paginated response.

<Callout type="info">
  Note that your component must be a descendant of [`<ClerkProvider/>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider).
</Callout>

```jsx
import { useOrganization } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function MemberList() {
  const { memberships } = useOrganization({
    memberships: {
      infinite: true,
      keepPreviousData: true,
    },
  });

  if (!memberships) {
    // loading state
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Organization members</h2>
      <ul>
        {memberships.data?.map((membership) => (
          <li key={membership.id}>
            {membership.publicUserData.firstName} {membership.publicUserData.lastName} &lt;
            {membership.publicUserData.identifier}&gt; :: {membership.role}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <button
        disabled={!memberships.hasPreviousPage}
        onClick={memberships.fetchPrevious}
      >
        Prev
      </button>
      <button
        disabled={!memberships.hasNextPage}
        onClick={memberships.fetchNext}
      >
        Next
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
