The Clerk React Router SDK gives you access to prebuilt components, React hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier. Refer to the [quickstart guide](/docs/react-router/getting-started/quickstart) to get started.

## Client-side helpers

Because the React Router SDK is built on top of the [React SDK](/docs/reference/react/overview), you can use the hooks that the React SDK provides. These hooks include access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk) object, [`User` object](/docs/reference/javascript/user), [`Organization` object](/docs/reference/javascript/organization), and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. Learn more in the [React SDK reference](/docs/reference/react/overview).

## Server-side helpers

The following references show how to integrate Clerk features into applications using React Router server functions and API routes.

- [`getAuth()`](/docs/reference/react-router/get-auth)
- [`rootAuthLoader()`](/docs/reference/react-router/root-auth-loader)

## React Router implementations

React Router can be integrated with Clerk in three ways:

- **Framework mode (recommended):** Configure your app using [Clerk's React Router SDK](/docs/react-router/getting-started/quickstart).
- **Declarative mode:** Manually integrate React Router into your React + Vite app using [declarative mode](/docs/guides/development/declarative-mode).
- **Data mode:** Use React Router's data APIs to load data and manage state in your Clerk app. To use React Router in data mode, see the [demo repository](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-react-quickstart/blob/integrate-react-router-dom-using-data-router-method/src/main.tsx).
