title: Build your own sign-up page for your Next.js app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add a custom sign-up page to your Next.js app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

By default, the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/references/nextjs/custom-sign-in-or-up-page) component handles signing-in or signing-up, but if you'd like to have a dedicated sign-up page, this guide shows you how to use the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component with the [Next.js optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments) in order to build custom sign-up page for your Next.js app.

If the prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx' }}
  import { SignUp } from '@clerk/nextjs'

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignUp />
  }
  ```

  ## Make the sign-up route public

  By default, `clerkMiddleware()` makes all routes public. **This step is specifically for applications that have configured `clerkMiddleware()` to make [all routes protected](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#protect-all-routes).** If you have not configured `clerkMiddleware()` to protect all routes, you can skip this step.

  To make the sign-up route public:

  - Navigate to your `middleware.ts` file.
  - Add the sign-up route to your existing route matcher that is making routes public.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts', ins: [5] }}
  import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  // prettier-ignore
  const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher([
    '/sign-in(.*)',
    '/sign-up(.*)'
  ])

  export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, request) => {
    if (!isPublicRoute(request)) {
      await auth.protect()
    }
  })

  export const config = {
    matcher: [
      // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
      '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
      // Always run for API routes
      '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
    ],
  }
  ```

  ## Update your environment variables

  Update your environment variables to point to your custom sign-in and sign-up pages. Learn more about the available [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables).

  ```env {{ filename: '.env.local', ins: [2] }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
  ```

  ## Visit your new page

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/sign-up).
