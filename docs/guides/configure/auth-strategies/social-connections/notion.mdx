Enabling OAuth with Notion allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Notion account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Notion**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Notion Developer](https://developers.notion.com) page.

  ### Enable Notion as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Notion**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Authorization URL** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Create a Notion app

  1. In the top-right of the [Notion Developer](https://developers.notion.com) home page, select **View my integrations**. You'll be redirected to the **Integrations** page.
  1. Select **New integration**.
  1. Fill out the necessary information. In the **Type** dropdown, select **Public**. Under **Authorization URL**, paste the **Authorization URL** value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard and then select it.
  1. Select **Save**. The **Integration successfully created** modal will open. Select **Configure integration settings**. You'll be redirected to the app's **Configuration** page.
  1. Save the **OAuth Client ID** and **OAuth Client Secret** somewhere secure.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ### Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/test-your-connection" />
