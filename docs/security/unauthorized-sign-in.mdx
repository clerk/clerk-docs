Clerk identifies attempts by unauthorized individuals or entities to access a user's account.

## Detecting unauthorized sign-ins

Whenever a sign-in attempt is completed from a device that hasn't been used before by the user who is the account owner, Clerk sends an email notification to the account owner with information about the newly created session.

The account owner can choose to immediately revoke the session in question.

To configure this feature:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active).
1. In the secondary navigation header, select **Configure**.
1. From the navigation sidebar, select **Emails** under the **Customization** menu group.
1. Locate the **New client sign in** email template and click on the toggle next to it in order to disable the feature.
1. You can customize the email content, similar to how you can customize the rest of the email templates. See [Email and SMS templates](/docs/authentication/configuration/email-sms-templates) for more information.

## Email notification for unauthorized access

The email notification that users receive when Clerk detects an unauthorized sign-in can vary depending on the instance's configuration and the application's billing plan.

By default, the email contains information about the unauthorized sign-in, like the type of the device, operating system, IP address and location and the method that was used for signing in.

If you've set a support email for your application, Clerk will include instructions for the user to contact the application's administrator.

Finally, for instances that support it, the email content can include a button to sign out of the unrecognized device. When clicked, this button will immediately revoke the suspicious session.

To customize the unauthorized sign-in email notification:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active).
1. In the secondary navigation header, select **Configure**.
1. From the navigation sidebar, select **Emails** under the **Customization** menu group.
1. Locate the **New client sign in** email template and select it.
1. Edit the email template and apply your changes.

## Session revocation for unauthorized sign-ins

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is not available in production for free plans, though you can try it out free in development to see if it works for you. See the [pricing](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} page for more information.

For applications that support it, users can immediately revoke unauthorized sign-ins from inside the email notification body. With the click of a button, the suspicious session will be revoked and the user will be redirected to a confirmation page. The contents of the confirmation page depend on the instance's configuration.

For instances that have enabled the [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), the user will be redirected to the [Unauthorized sign-in](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview#unauthorized-sign-in) page. The page content can be customized based on the application's theme.

For instances that have disabled the Account Portal, users will see a plain text message as a confirmation of the successful session revocation.

In any case, the user will need to sign in again to the application, unless there is an active session for their device.

You can customize the URL path of the Unauthorized sign in page:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active).
1. In the secondary navigation header, select **Configure**.
1. From the navigation sidebar, select **Paths** under the **Developer** menu group.
1. Edit the Unauthorized sign in page path and apply your changes.
