title: The Backend `User` object
description: The Backend User object holds information about a user of your application. However, the Backend User object is different from the User object in that it is used in the Backend API.
---

The Backend `User` object is similar to the `User` object as it holds information about a user of your application, such as their unique identifier, name, email addresses, phone numbers, and more. However, the Backend `User` object is different from the `User` object in that it is used in the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/GetUser){{ target: '_blank' }} and is not directly accessible from the Frontend API.
