description: Creates a new invitation for the given email address and sends the invitation email.
---

Creates a new invitation for the given email address and sends the invitation email.

If an email address has already been invited or already exists in your application, trying to create a new invitation will return an error. To bypass this error and create a new invitation anyways, set `ignoreExisting` to `true`.

```tsx
const invitation = await clerkClient.invitations.createInvitation({
  emailAddress: 'invite@example.com',
  redirectUrl: 'https://optionally-redirect-here',
  publicMetadata: {
    "example": "metadata",
    "example_nested": {
      "nested": "metadata",
    },
  }
});
```
