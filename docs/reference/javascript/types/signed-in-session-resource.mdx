title: '`SignedInSessionResource`'
description: A session for a logged-in user that is either fully active or waiting to complete additional verification steps.
sdk: js-frontend

The `SignedInSessionResource` is a type that represents sessions for users who have completed the full sign-in flow. It's a union of [`ActiveSessionResource`](#active-session-resource) and [`PendingSessionResource`](#pending-session-resource).

```typescript
type SignedInSessionResource = ActiveSessionResource | PendingSessionResource
```

It contains all properties from the [`Session`](/docs/reference/javascript/session) object, but guarantees that the `user` property is non-null and the `status` is either `active` or `pending`.

## `ActiveSessionResource`

An active session means the user is fully logged in and ready to use your app.

<Properties>
  - `status`
  - `'active'`

  Always `'active'` for this session type.

  ---

  - `user`
  - [`User`](/docs/reference/javascript/user)

  The user associated with the session. This property is guaranteed to be non-null for active sessions.
</Properties>

## `PendingSessionResource`

A pending session means the user has logged in but needs to complete one or more additional verification steps (like authenticating with a second factor) before they have full access.

<Properties>
  - `status`
  - `'pending'`

  Always `'pending'` for this session type.

  ---

  - `user`
  - [`User`](/docs/reference/javascript/user)

  The user associated with the session. This property is guaranteed to be non-null for pending sessions.

  ---

  - `currentTask`
  - [`SessionTask`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/session-task)

  The current pending task for the session. Read more about [session tasks](/docs/guides/configure/session-tasks).
</Properties>
