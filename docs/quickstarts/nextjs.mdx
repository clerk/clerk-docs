# Use Clerk with Next.js

Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Next.js application. Clerk works seamlessly in both client side and server side components.

<Steps>

### Install `@clerk/nextjs`

Once you have a Next.js application ready, you need to install Clerk's Next.js SDK. This gives you access to prebuilt components and hooks, as well as [helpers](/docs/references/nextjs/overview) for Next.js API routes, server-side rendering, and middleware.

<CodeBlockTabs options={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/nextjs
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add @clerk/nextjs
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @clerk/nextjs
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment keys

Below is an example of an `.env.local` file. If you are signed into your Clerk Dashboard, your keys should become visible by clicking on the eye icon.

<InjectKeys>

```sh filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
```

</InjectKeys>

### Mount `<ClerkProvider />`

Add the [`<ClerkProvider />`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) wrapper to your application. The `<ClerkProvider />` component wraps your Next.js application to provide active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components. A reasonable default approach is to have `<ClerkProvider />` wrap the `<body/>` to enable the context to be accessible anywhere within the app.


<Callout type="info">
  The `<ClerkProvider />` component needs to access [headers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) to authenticate correctly. This means anything wrapped by the provider will be opted into [dynamic rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) at request time. If you have static-optimized or ISR pages that you would prefer not to be opted into dynamic rendering, make sure they are <em>not</em> wrapped by `<ClerkProvider />`.
  
  This is easiest to accomplish by ensuring that `<ClerkProvider />` is added further down the tree to wrap route groups that explicitly need authentication instead of having the provider wrap your application root as recommended above. For example, if your project includes a set of landing/marketing pages as well as a dashboard that requires login, you would create separate `(marketing)` and `(dashboard)` route groups. Adding `<ClerkProvider />` to the `(dashboard)/layout.jsx` layout file will ensure that only those routes are opted into dynamic rendering, allowing the marketing routes to be statically optimized.

</Callout>

<CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx"
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Next.js 13 with Clerk',
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      <html lang="en">
        <body>{children}</body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="_app.tsx"
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
export default MyApp;
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

<Callout type="warning">
  The root layout is a server component. If you plan to use the `<ClerkProvider />` outside the root layout, it will need to be a server component as well.
</Callout>

### Protect your application

Now that Clerk is installed and mounted in your application, it’s time to decide which pages are public and which need to hide behind authentication. We do this by creating a `middleware.ts` file at the root folder (or inside `src/` if that is how you set up your app).

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

// This example protects all routes including api/trpc routes
// Please edit this to allow other routes to be public as needed.
// See https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware for more information about configuring your middleware
export default authMiddleware({});

export const config = {
      matcher: ['/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],
};

```

With this middleware, your entire application is protected. If you try to access it, the middleware will redirect you to your Sign Up page. If you want to make other routes public, check out the [authMiddleware reference page](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware).



<Callout type="info" emoji="🎉">
 At this point, your application is fully protected by Clerk and uses Clerk's [Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview) pages that are available out of box.
 Start your Next.js application via `npm run dev`, visit `http://localhost:3000`, and sign up to get access to your application.
</Callout>


### Build your own sign in and sign up pages

In addition to the Account Portal, Clerk also offers a set of [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) that you can use instead to embed sign in, sign up, and other user management functions into your Next.js application. We are going to use the `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` components by utilizing the Next.js optional catch-all route.

#### Build your sign up page


<CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
  ```tsx filename="app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx"
  import { SignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs";

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignUp />;
  }
  ```

  ```tsx filename="/pages/sign-up/[[...index]].tsx"
  import { SignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs";

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignUp />;
  }
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

#### Build your sign in page


<CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
  ```tsx filename="app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx"
  import { SignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignIn />;
  }
  ```

  ```tsx filename="/pages/sign-in/[[...index]].tsx"
  import { SignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignIn />;
  }
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  By default, the Clerk components inherit the font family. `create-next-app` does not apply a global font family. When you launch your application, you may notice that the font family is different.
</Callout>


#### Update your environment variables

Next, add environment variables for the `signIn`, `signUp`, `afterSignUp`, and `afterSignIn` paths:

```sh filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
```

These values control the behavior of the components when you sign in or sign up and when you click on the respective links at the bottom of each component.

### Embed the `<UserButton />`

The [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button) allows users to manage their account information and log out, thus allowing you to complete a full authentication circle.

You can add it anywhere you want, but next to the logo in your main application page is a good start.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import { UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/"/>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="pages/example.tsx"
import { UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <>
			<header>
				<UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/"/>
			</header>
			<div>Your page's content can go here.</div>
    </>
  );
}
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Sign up for your application

Now start your Next.js application via `npm run dev`, visit `http://localhost:3000`, and sign up to get access to your application.

</Steps>

## Read session and user data

Clerk provides a set of [hooks and helpers](/docs/references/nextjs/overview#client-side-helpers) that you can use to access the active session and user data in your Next.js application. Here are examples of how to use these helpers in both the client and server side to get you started.

### Client side

#### `useAuth`

The [`useAuth`](/docs/references/react/use-auth) hook is a convenient way to access the current auth state. This hook provides the minimal information needed for data-loading and helper methods to manage the current active session.

```tsx filename="example.tsx"
"use client";
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Example() {
  const { isLoaded, userId, sessionId, getToken } = useAuth();

  // In case the user signs out while on the page.
  if (!isLoaded || !userId) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      Hello, {userId} your current active session is {sessionId}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### `useUser`

The [`useUser`](/docs/references/react/use-user) hook is a convenient way to access the current user data where you need it. This hook provides the user data and helper methods to manage the current active session.

```tsx filename="example.tsx"
"use client";
import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Example() {
  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser();

  if (!isLoaded || !isSignedIn) {
    return null;
  }

  return <div>Hello, {user.firstName} welcome to Clerk</div>;
}
```

### Server side

#### API Routes

You can protect your API routes by using the [`getAuth`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) helper and retrieve data from your own systems.

```tsx filename="pages/api/auth.ts"
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const { userId } = getAuth(req);
  if (!userId) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
    return;
  }
  // retrieve data from your database
  res.status(200).json({});
}
```

In some cases, you may need the full [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user) object. For example, if you want to access the user's email address or name. You can use the [`clerkClient`](/docs/references/backend/overview) helper to get the full `User` object.


```tsx filename="pages/api/auth.ts"
import { clerkClient } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const { userId } = getAuth(req);

  if (!userId) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }

  const user = userId ? await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId) : null;

  // use the user object to decide what data to return

  return res.status(200).json({});
}
```

### Server side render user data

<Tabs items={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
  <Tab>
    #### **`currentUser()`**

    [`currentUser()`](/docs/references/nextjs/current-user) loads the `User` object for the authenticated user from Clerk's backend API. This is helpful if you want to render information, like their first and last name, directly from the server.

    Under the hood, this calls `fetch()` so it is automatically deduped per request.

    ```tsx filename="page.tsx"
    import { currentUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";
    import type { User } from "@clerk/nextjs/api";

    export default async function Page() {
      const user: User | null = await currentUser();
      // ...
    }
    ```

    #### **`auth()`**

    Clerk has introduced a new [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) helper that returns the same [`Authentication` Object](/docs/references/nextjs/authentication-object) as [`getAuth(req)`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) in middleware, getServerSideProps, and API routes.

    Since request data like `headers()` and `cookies()` is now available in the global scope for Next.js, you no longer need to explicitly pass a `Request` object to Clerk.

    ```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
    import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export default function Page() {
      const { userId } = auth();
      // ...
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    You can access the active session and user data in your `getServerSideProps` using the [`getAuth`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) helper.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Please note the addition of buildClerkProps in the return statement, which informs our React helpers of the authentication state during server-side rendering (like `useAuth()`, `<SignedIn>`, and `<SignedOut>`).
    </Callout>

    ```tsx filename="pages/example.tsx"
    import { getAuth, buildClerkProps } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
    import { GetServerSideProps } from "next";

    export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (ctx) => {
      const { userId } = getAuth(ctx.req);

      if (!userId) {
        // handle user is not logged in.
      }

      // Load any data your application needs for the page using the userId
      return { props: { ...buildClerkProps(ctx.req) } };
    };
    ```

    You can also access the full user object before passing it to the page using the `clerkClient` helper.

    ```tsx filename="pages/example.tsx"
    import { clerkClient } from "@clerk/nextjs";
    import { getAuth, buildClerkProps } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
    import { GetServerSideProps } from "next";

    export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (ctx) => {
      const { userId } = getAuth(ctx.req);

      const user = userId ? await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId) : undefined;

      return { props: { ...buildClerkProps(ctx.req, { user }) } };
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
