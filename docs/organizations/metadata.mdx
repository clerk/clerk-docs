description: Organization objects hold a set of metadata that can be used internally to store arbitrary information.

> This guide is for users who want to build a _custom_ user interface using the Clerk API. To create organizations using a _prebuilt_ UI, you should use Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview).

Organization metadata allows you to store information about an organization that is not part of the standard fields, such as custom attributes that are specific to your application.

There are two types of metadata: **public** and **private**.

- Both **public** and **private** metadata are set and can be accessed from the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }}.
- Only **public** metadata can be accessed from the [Frontend API](/docs/reference/frontend-api/){{ target: '_blank' }}.

Both the `Organization` and `Organization Membership` objects have the metadata fields: `publicMetadata` and `privateMetadata`.

- Use the `publicMetadata` property if you need to set some metadata from your backend and have them displayed as read-only on the frontend.
- Use the `privateMetadata` property if the custom attributes contain sensitive information that should not be displayed on the frontend.

## Set organization metadata

To ease the flow of setting metadata, Clerk provides the `updateOrganizationMetadata()` and `updateOrganizationMembershipMetadata()` methods from the [Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview), which is a wrapper around the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }}.

> [!WARNING]
> Metadata is limited to **8kb** maximum.
