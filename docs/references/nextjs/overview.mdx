description: Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Next.js application using the Clerk Next.js SDK.
---

The Clerk Next.js SDK is the recommended method for integrating Clerk into your Next.js application.

## Client-side helpers

Because the Next.js SDK is built on top of the Clerk React SDK, you can use the hooks that the React SDK provides. These hooks give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. Learn more in the [React SDK reference](/docs/references/react/overview).

## Server-side helpers

### App router

Clerk provides first-class support for the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app). The following references show how to integrate Clerk features into apps using the latest App Router and React Server Components features.

- [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth)
- [`currentUser()`](/docs/references/nextjs/current-user)
- [Route Handlers](/docs/references/nextjs/route-handlers)
- [Server Actions](/docs/references/nextjs/server-actions)

### Pages router

Clerk continues to provide drop-in support for the Next.js Pages Router. In addition to the main Clerk integration, the following references are available for apps using Pages Router.

- [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth)
- [`buildClerkProps()`](/docs/references/nextjs/build-clerk-props)

## `Auth` object

Both `auth()` (App Router) and `getAuth()` (Pages Router) return an `Auth` object. This JavaScript object contains important information like the current user's session ID, user ID, and organization ID. Learn more about the [`Auth` object](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }}.

## `clerkMiddleware()`

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Next.js application through middleware. It allows you to integrate authorization into both the client and server of your application. You can learn more [here](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware).

## Demo repositories

For examples of Clerk's features, such as user and organization management, integrated into a single application, see the Next.js demo repositories:

- [Clerk + Next.js Pages Router Demo](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-nextjs-demo-pages-router)
