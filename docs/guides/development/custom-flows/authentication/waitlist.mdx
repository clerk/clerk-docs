Clerk's [`<Waitlist />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/waitlist) component provides an out-of-the-box solution for allowing users to join your waitlist for early access to your app. However, if you're building a custom user interface, you can use the [`useWaitlist()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-waitlist) hook to build a custom waitlist form.

This guide demonstrates how to use the Clerk API to build a custom user interface for joining your app's waitlist.

## Before you start

Before using the `useWaitlist()` hook, you must enable **Waitlist** mode in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Waitlist**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/waitlist) page.
1. Toggle on **Enable waitlist** and select **Save**.
