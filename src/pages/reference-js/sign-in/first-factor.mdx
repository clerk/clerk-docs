# First Factor

These are all methods on [the `SignIn` class](/reference-js/sign-in/sign-in) that allow you to handle the first factor of a multi-factor authentication flow.

## `prepareFirstFactor()`

```typescript
function prepareFirstFactor(params: PrepareFirstFactorParams): Promise<SignIn>;
```

Begins the first factor verification process. This is a required step in order to complete a sign in, as users should be verified at least by one factor of authentication.

Common scenarios are one-time code (OTP) or social account (SSO) verification. This is determined by the accepted `strategy` parameter values. Each authentication identifier supports different strategies.

 The <code>strategy</code> value depends on the object's <code>identifier</code> value. Each authentication identifier supports different verification strategies. Possible strategy values are:
 <ul> 
<li><strong><code>email_link</code></strong>: User will receive an email magic link via email. The <code>email_address_id</code> parameter can also be specified to select one of the user's known email addresses.</li>
<li><strong><code>email_code</code></strong>: User will receive a one-time authentication code via email. At least one email address should be on file for the user. The <code>email_address_id</code> parameter can also be specified to select one of the user's known email addresses.</li>
<li><strong><code>phone_code</code></strong>: User will receive a one-time authentication code in their phone, via SMS. At least one phone number should be on file for the user. The <code>phone_number_id</code> parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known phone numbers the SMS will go to.</li>
<li><strong><code>web3_metamask_signature</code></strong>: The verification will attempt to be completed using the user's web3 wallet public address. The <code>web3_wallet_id</code> parameter can also be specified to select which of the user's known web3 wallets will be used. Currently Clerk supports <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a >.</li>
<li><strong><code>{"oauth_<provider>"}</code></strong>: The user will be authenticated with their Social login account. See available <a href="https://clerk.com/docs/reference/clerkjs/signin#oauth-strategies">OAuth Strategies</a>.</li>

## `attemptFirstFactor()`

```typescript
function attemptFirstFactor(params: AttemptFirstFactorParams): Promise<SignIn>;
```

Attempts to complete the first factor verification process. This is a required step in order to complete a sign in, as users should be verified at least by one factor of authentication.

Make sure that a `SignIn` object already exists before you call this method, either by first calling `SignIn.create` or `SignIn.prepareFirstFactor`. The only strategy that does not require a verification to have already been prepared before attempting to complete it, is the **password** strategy.

Depending on the strategy that was selected when the verification was prepared, the method parameters should be different.
