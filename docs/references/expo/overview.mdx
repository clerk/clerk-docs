# Expo and Clerk

> [!WARNING]
> Currently the `@clerk/expo` SDK only supports mobile app output. Expo web us not supported. You can upvote the addition of Clerk supporting web output [here](https://feedback.clerk.com/roadmap/fb56a8db-763a-4e0d-a4b2-f8a453be195c).

Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your Expo application. This documentation covers the capabilities and methods available from Clerk's Expo SDK.

See [the quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/expo) to get started.

## Custom authentication examples

The following guides demonstrate how to build Clerk authentication flows in an Expo app:

- [Multi-factor authentication](/docs/references/expo/expo-mfa)
- [OAuth](/docs/references/expo/expo-oauth)
- [User impersonation](/docs/references/expo/expo-impersonation)

For more on deployment of your Expo application, please see our [Deployment tips for Expo users](https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/deploy-expo).
