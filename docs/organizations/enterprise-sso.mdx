title: Organization-level Enterprise SSO

---

Clerk supports adding an enterprise SSO to an organization to allow for sign-in with an IdP and seamless organization onboarding. All types of [enterprise connections](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/authentication-flows) are supported.

When a user signs in or signs up with an organization's enterprise connection, they will also be added as a member of that organization and assigned the [default role](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#default-roles).

## Add an organization-level enterprise SSO connection

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For specific domains or organizations**.
1. Select a Identity Provider.
2. Add the **Domain** for which you want to enable this connection and select an **Organization**.

## Onboarding flows with enterprise SSO

Using organizations with enterprise SSO can unlock powerful onboarding flows for your enterprise users. Here are two common scenarios:

### Organization created first (Top-down approach)

1. You create an organization for your customer through the Clerk Dashboard
2. Collaborate with the customer's IT administrator to obtain the necessary SSO configuration details
3. Configure the SSO connection for the organization via the Dashboard
4. Invite users to the organization, who can sign in using SSO

This flow is common for enterprise sales where the relationship is established before users start accessing the application.

### User-initiated setup (Bottom-up approach)

1. End user signs up to evaluate your application, starting with an individual account
2. After deciding to adopt the application, they create an organization for their company
3. Configure SSO for the organization through the Clerk Dashboard
4. All subsequent users from that organization can now sign in using enterprise SSO

This flow is common when individual users try the product before company-wide adoption.

### Domain-based SSO enforcement

SSO connections are enforced on a per-domain basis within organizations. This allows for flexible access management:

- You can configure SSO for your primary domain (e.g., `company.com`) to enforce SSO authentication for employees
- Simultaneously, you can add verified domains without SSO for external collaborators (like contractors or consultants)
