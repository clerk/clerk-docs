# Building your custom UI with Clerk Hooks

A *custom flow* refers to a user flow created entirely from scratch using the Clerk API. If Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API.


## Authentication UI

You can build custom sign up and sign in components, or even create a combined ui.

### Sign-up flow

pYou can build your custom sign up component using the [useSignUp()](/docs/references/react/use-sign-up) hook. The `useSignUp()` hook enables you to build UI to handle any of the sign up methods Clerk offers.

Clerk provides a flexible way to build sign-up flows in your application. You can use a single [`SignUp`][sign-up-ref] object to gather information, verify their email address or phone number, add OAuth accounts, and finally, convert them into a [`User`][user-ref].

Every [`SignUp`][sign-up-ref] has a set of requirements it must meet before it is turned into a [`User`][user-ref]. These requirements are defined by the instance settings you selected in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). Once all requirements are met, the [`SignUp`][sign-up-ref] will turn into a new [`User`][user-ref], and an active session for that [`User`][user-ref] will be created on the current [`Client`][client-ref].

Don't worry about collecting all the required fields at once and passing them to a single request. The API is designed to accommodate a progressive sign-up flow, often corresponding to multi-step sign-up forms.

### Sign-in flow

You can build your custom sign up component using the [useSignIn](/docs/references/react/use-sign-in) hook. With the `useSignIn()` hooks you can replicate the sign in methods Clerk offers and build your own UI to handle the process.

Sign-in's are initiated by creating a [`SignIn`][sign-in-ref] object on the current [`Client`][client-ref]. The [`SignIn`][sign-in-ref] handles all the state and logic associated with a sign-in. If the sign-in is successfully authenticated, it will transform into an active session on the current [`Client`][client-ref].

#### Completing a sign-in

There are 3 main steps a user must perform in order to complete a sign-in.

<Steps>

#### Identification

The first step a user needs to make is to identify what account they'd like to sign in to. This is done with an identifier, which can either be an email address, a phone number, or a username.

#### Factor one verification

Once a user is identified, they need to prove their identity. This is the process of "authenticating" the user. There's a number of strategies a user can use to perform authentication with the most basic being the humble password. Other authentication strategies, like passwordless sign-in, can be explored in the [sign-in and sign-up options](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#authentication-strategies) guide.

#### Factor two verification (optional)

This step only applies to users that have turned on two-factor authentication, also known as [multifactor authentication](/docs/custom-flows/mfa), for their user.

When one form of verification isn't enough, trust two! Forcing two different verification steps vastly increases the security of your account. The most common setup a user will have to protect their account is using a password as their first kind of verification and a `phone_code` as their second kind of verification.

</Steps>

## Account Related Components

Do you want to build your own version of the [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/components/user/user-profile) component? Do you need to create a specific component just to to allow the user to add an OAuth account? Using the [`useUser()`](/docs/references/react/use-user) amd [`useClerk()`](/docs/references/react/use-clerk) hooks you can

## Organization Compponents

You can creare your own custom versions of Organization components using the [`useOrganization()`](/docs/references/react/use-organization) and [`useOrganizationList()`](/docs/references/react/use-organization-list) hooks.
