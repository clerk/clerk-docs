Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your TanStack Start application.

<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/tanstack-start`

  Once you have a TanStack Start application ready, you need to install Clerk's [TanStack Start SDK](/docs/references/tanstack-start/overview). This gives you access to Clerk's prebuilt components and hooks for TanStack Start applications.

  Add the SDK to your project by running the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/tanstack-start@beta
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/tanstack-start@beta
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/tanstack-start@beta
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
    1. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
    1. Paste your keys into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ### Add `createClerkHandler()`

  TanStack's [`createStartHandler()`](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/start/getting-started#the-server-entry-point) creates a server-side handler that determines which routes and loaders need to be executed when the user hits a given route.

  Clerk's [`createClerkHandler()`](/docs/references/tanstack-start/create-clerk-handler) configures Clerk to handle authentication state for TanStack routes, allowing you to easily access user session information within your app.

  Update your app's SSR entrypoint by wrapping `createStartHandler()` in `createClerkHandler()`, as shown in the following example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/ssr.tsx' }}
  import { createStartHandler, defaultStreamHandler } from '@tanstack/start/server'
  import { getRouterManifest } from '@tanstack/start/router-manifest'
  import { createRouter } from './router'
  import { createClerkHandler } from '@clerk/tanstack-start/server'

  export default createClerkHandler(
    createStartHandler({
      createRouter,
      getRouterManifest,
    }),
  )(defaultStreamHandler)
  ```

  ### Add `<ClerkProvider>`

  The [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component wraps your application to provide active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components.

  Add the `<ClerkProvider>` component to your app's root route, as shown in the following example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/__root.tsx', ins: [4, 18, 29] }}
  import { Outlet, ScrollRestoration, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
  import { Body, Head, Html, Meta, Scripts } from '@tanstack/start'
  import * as React from 'react'
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/tanstack-start'

  export const Route = createRootRoute({
    component: () => {
      return (
        <RootDocument>
          <Outlet />
        </RootDocument>
      )
    },
  })

  function RootDocument({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    return (
      <ClerkProvider>
        <Html>
          <Head>
            <Meta />
          </Head>
          <Body>
            {children}
            <ScrollRestoration />
            <Scripts />
          </Body>
        </Html>
      </ClerkProvider>
    )
  }
  ```

  ### Protect your pages

  #### Client-side

  To protect your pages on the client-side, you can use Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/components/overview#what-are-control-components) that control the visibility of content based on the user's authentication state.

  The following example uses the following components:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button): A prebuilt component that comes styled out of the box to show the avatar from the account the user is signed in with.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page. For this example, it links to the [Account Portal sign-in page.](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview)
  - [`<SignUpButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-up-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-up page or displays the sign-up modal, depending on which `mode` you have set. For this example, it links to the [Account Portal sign-up page.](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview)

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/index.tsx' }}
  import {
    SignedIn,
    UserButton,
    SignOutButton,
    SignedOut,
    SignInButton,
    SignUpButton,
  } from '@clerk/tanstack-start'
  import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
    component: Home,
  })

  function Home() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Index Route</h1>
        <SignedIn>
          <p>You are signed in</p>

          <UserButton />

          <SignOutButton />
        </SignedIn>
        <SignedOut>
          <p>You are signed out</p>

          <SignInButton />

          <SignUpButton />
        </SignedOut>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  #### Server-side

  To protect your routes, create a [server function](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/start/server-functions) that checks the user's authentication state via Clerk's [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/tanstack-start/get-auth) method. If the user is not authenticated, they are redirected to a sign-in page. If authenticated, the user's `userId` is passed to the route, allowing access to the `<Home />` component, which welcomes the user and displays their `userId`. The [`beforeLoad()`](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/api/router/RouteOptionsType#beforeload-method) method ensures authentication is checked before loading the page, and the [`loader()`](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/api/router/RouteOptionsType#loader-method) method returns the user data for use in the component.

  > [!TIP]
  > Ensure that your app has the [TanStack Start API entry handler](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/start/api-routes#setting-up-the-entry-handler) configured in order for your API routes to work.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/index.tsx' }}
  import { createFileRoute, redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'
  import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'
  import { getAuth } from '@clerk/tanstack-start/server'

  const authStateFn = createServerFn('GET', async (_, { request }) => {
    const { userId } = await getAuth(request)

    if (!userId) {
      // This will error because you're redirecting to a path that doesn't exist yet
      // You can create a sign-in route to handle this
      throw redirect({
        to: '/sign-in/$',
      })
    }

    return { userId }
  })

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
    component: Home,
    beforeLoad: async () => await authStateFn(),
    loader: async ({ context }) => {
      return { userId: context.userId }
    },
  })

  function Home() {
    const state = Route.useLoaderData()

    return <h1>Welcome! Your ID is {state.userId}!</h1>
  }
  ```

  ### Create your first user

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your app's homepage at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Sign up to create your first user.
