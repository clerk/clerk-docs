How to set up social connection with Spotify

## Overview

Adding social connection with Spotify to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in your instance settings.

> Clerk does not currently support preconfigured shared OAuth credentials for Spotify on development instances. You will have to use your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for both development and production instances.

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Spotify developer account. To create one, [click here](https://developer.spotify.com/).

## Configuring Spotify social connection

First, you need to create a new OAuth Spotify app.

You need to set **App name**, **App description** and **Redirect URI**. **Website** is optional.

To find your redirect URI, go to the [Social Connections page](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections) in your Clerk Dashboard and enable Spotify. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Redirect URIs**. Paste the value into the **Redirect URIs** input in the Spotify dashboard and click **Save**.

Once your app is created, you'll be redirected to the app dashboard. From there, navigate to **Settings**.
