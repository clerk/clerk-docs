# Testing with Playwright

Playwright is a well-established JavaScript testing framework. This guide aims to help you set up your environment for creating authenticated tests with Clerk. This guide will assume you're somewhat familiar with Clerk and Playwright.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check out the [demo repo](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-playwright-nextjs) that tests a Clerk-powered application using [Testing Tokens](/docs/testing/overview#testing-tokens).

<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/testing`

  Clerk's testing package provides integration helpers for popular testing frameworks. Install it by running the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
    ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm i @clerk/testing --save-dev
    ```

    ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add -D @clerk/testing
    ```

    ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/testing -D
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your API keys

  In your test runner, set your publishable and secret key as the `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variables, respectively.

  To find your keys:

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
  1. In the navigation sidebar, select **API Keys**.
  1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.

  > [!WARNING]
  > Ensure you provide the secret key in a secure manner, to avoid leaking it to third parties. For example, if you are using GitHub Actions, refer to [_Using secrets in GitHub Actions_](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

  ### Global setup

  To set up Clerk with Playwright, you must call the `clerkSetup()` function in your [global setup file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-global-setup-teardown).

  ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'global-setup.ts' }}
  import { clerkSetup } from '@clerk/testing/playwright';
  import { test as setup } from '@playwright/test';

  setup('global setup', async ({ }) => {
    await clerkSetup();
  });
  ```

  `clerkSetup` will obtain a [Testing Token](/docs/testing/overview#testing-tokens) when your test suite starts, making it available for all subsequent tests to use.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can set the Testing Token yourself as opposed to calling `clerkSetup`, by
  > setting it in the `CLERK_TESTING_TOKEN` environment variable.

  ### Use `setupClerkTestingToken`

  Now that Cypress is configured with Clerk, you can use the `setupClerkTestingToken()` function in your tests to augment them with the Testing Token. See the following example:

  ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'my-test.spec.ts' }}
  import { setupClerkTestingToken } from "@clerk/testing/playwright";
  import { test } from "@playwright/test";

  test("sign up", async ({ page }) => {
    await setupClerkTestingToken({ page });

    await page.goto("/sign-up");
    // ...
  });
  ```
</Steps>
