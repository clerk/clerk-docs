The `organizationSyncOptions` property on the [`clerkMiddleware()`](#clerk-middleware-options) options
object has the type `OrganizationSyncOptions`, which has the following properties:

<Properties>
  - `organizationPatterns`
  - <code>[Pattern](#pattern)\[]</code>

  Specifies URL patterns that are Organization-specific, containing an Organization ID or slug as a path parameter. If a request matches this path, the Organization identifier will be used to set that Organization as active.

  If the route also matches the `personalAccountPatterns` prop, this prop takes precedence.

  Patterns must have a path parameter named either `:id` (to match a Clerk Organization ID) or `:slug` (to match a Clerk Organization slug).

  > [!WARNING]
  > If the Organization can't be activated—either because it doesn't exist or the user lacks access—the previously [Active Organization](!active-organization) will remain unchanged. Components must detect this case and provide an appropriate error and/or resolution pathway, such as calling `notFound()` or displaying an [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher).

  Common examples:

  - `["/orgs/:slug", "/orgs/:slug/(.*)"]`
  - `["/orgs/:id", "/orgs/:id/(.*)"]`
  - `["/app/:any/orgs/:slug", "/app/:any/orgs/:slug/(.*)"]`

  ---

  - `personalAccountPatterns`
  - <code>[Pattern](#pattern)\[]</code>

  URL patterns for resources that exist within the context of a user's [Personal Account](/docs/guides/organizations/overview#allow-personal-accounts).

  If the route also matches the `organizationPattern` prop, the `organizationPattern` prop takes precedence.

  Common examples:

  - `["/me", "/me/(.*)"]`
  - `["/user/:any", "/user/:any/(.*)"]`
</Properties>

### Pattern

A `Pattern` is a `string` that represents the structure of a URL path. In addition to any valid URL, it may include:

- Named path parameters prefixed with a colon (e.g., `:id`, `:slug`, `:any`).
- Wildcard token, `(.*)`, which matches the remainder of the path.

#### Examples

- `/orgs/:slug`

| URL | Matches | `:slug` value |
| - | - | - |
| `/orgs/acmecorp` | ✅ | `acmecorp` |
| `/orgs` | ❌ | n/a |
| `/orgs/acmecorp/settings` | ❌ | n/a |

- `/app/:any/orgs/:id`

| URL | Matches | `:id` value |
| - | - | - |
| `/app/petstore/orgs/org_123` | ✅ | `org_123` |
| `/app/dogstore/v2/orgs/org_123` | ❌ | n/a |

- `/personal-account/(.*)`

| URL | Matches |
