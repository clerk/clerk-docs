  ### Get a Clerk session token

  Visit your frontend that is using Clerk and sign in. Once you have signed in, open the browser [Dev Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) and go to the **Console** tab. Enter the following command:

  ```js
  await window.Clerk.session.getToken()
  ```

  Copy the console output and paste it into the box above to decode the token.

  Alternatively, you can use the [`getToken()`](/docs/reference/javascript/session#get-token) method from a Clerk SDK.
