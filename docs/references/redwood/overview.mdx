# Use Clerk with RedwoodJS

Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your RedwoodJS application.

<Steps>
  ### Create a RedwoodJS application

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm create redwood-app my-redwood-project --typescript
    ```

    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn create redwood-app my-redwood-project --typescript
    ```

    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm create redwood-app my-redwood-project --typescript
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set environment variables

  Below is an example of an `.env.local` file.

  **Pro tip!** If you are signed into your Clerk Dashboard, your secret key should become visible by clicking on the eye icon. Otherwise, you can find your keys in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.

  ```env {{ prettier: false, filename: '.env.local' }}
  CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  #### Update redwood.toml

  ```toml {{ prettier: false, filename: 'redwood.toml' }}
  [web]
    includeEnvironmentVariables = ['CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY']
  ```

  ### Set up Redwood auth

  The next step is to run a Redwood CLI command to install the required packages and generate some boilerplate code:

  ```sh {{ prettier: false, filename: 'my-redwood-project' }}
  yarn rw setup auth clerk --force
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > The `--force` flag is needed to overwrite the existing dbAuth logic, that is set by default.

  You can now access Clerk functions through the Redwood `useAuth()` hook, which is exported from `src/web/auth.tsx`, or you can use the Clerk components directly.

  ### Protecting your pages

  Below is an example of using the `useAuth()` hook to verify if the user is authenticated. This will open a modal for your user to sign in to their account.

  ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'index.tsx' }}
  import { useAuth } from '../../auth'

  const HomePage = () => {
    const { currentUser, isAuthenticated, logIn, logOut } = useAuth()

    return (
      <>
        {isAuthenticated ? (
          <button onClick={logOut}>Log out</button>
          <h1>Hello {currentUser.firstName}</h1>
        ) : (
          <button onClick={logIn}>Log in</button>
        )}
      </>
    )
  }

  export default HomePage
  ```

  ### Using Clerk components directly

  ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'index.tsx' }}
  import { SignInButton, UserButton } from '@clerk/clerk-react'
  import { useAuth } from '../../auth'

  const HomePage = () => {
    const { currentUser, isAuthenticated } = useAuth()

    return (
      <>
        {isAuthenticated ? (
          <UserButton />
          <h1>Hello {currentUser.firstName}</h1>
        ) : (
          <SignInButton mode="modal" />
        )}
      </>
    )
  }
  ```
</Steps>
