# `EmailAddress`

The `EmailAddress` object is a model around an email address. Email addresses are used to provide identification for users.

Email addresses must be **verified** to ensure that they can be assigned to their rightful owners. The `EmailAddress` object holds all necessary state around the verification process.

- The verification process always starts with the [`prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification) method, which will send a one-time verification code via an email message.
- The second and final step involves an attempt to complete the verification by calling the [`attemptVerification()`](#attempt-verification) method, passing the one-time code as a parameter.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `id` | `string` | A unique identifier for this email address. |
| `emailAddress` | `string` | The value of this email address. |
| `verification` | [`Verification`](/docs/references/javascript/types/verification) | An object holding information on the verification of this email address. |
| `linkedTo` | `Array<{id: string, type: string}>` | An array of objects containing information about any identifications that might be linked to this email address. |

## Methods

### `create()`

Creates a new email address for the current user.

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function create(): Promise<EmailAddress>;
```

### `destroy()`

Deletes this email address.

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function destroy(): Promise<void>;
```

### `toString()`

Returns the value for this email address. Can also be accessed via the `EmailAddress.emailAddress` attribute.

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function toString(): string;
```

### `prepareVerification()`

Kick off the verification process for this email address. An email message with a one-time code or an email-link will be sent to the email address box.

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function prepareVerification(params: PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<EmailAddress>;
```

#### `PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `strategy` | `'email_link' \| 'email_code'` | The verification strategy.<br />Possible strategy values are:<br /><ul><li>`email_link`: User will receive an email link via email.</li><li>`email_code`: User will receive a one-time authentication code via email.</li></ul> |
| `redirectUrl` | `string \| undefined` | The email link target URL. Users will be redirected here once they click the email link from their email. This param only applies if `strategy` is `email_link`. |

### `attemptVerification()`

Attempts to verify this email address, passing the one-time code that was sent as an email message. The code will be sent when calling the [EmailAddress.prepareVerification()](#prepare-verification) method.

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function attemptVerification(params: AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<EmailAddress>;
```

#### `AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `code` | `string` | The one-time code that was sent to the user's email address when [EmailAddress.prepareVerification()](#prepare-verification) was called with `strategy` set to `email_code`. |

### `createEmailLinkFlow()`

Sets up an email verification with email link flow. Calling `createEmailLinkFlow()` will return two functions.

The first function is async and starts the email link flow, preparing a email link verification. It sends the email link email and starts polling for verification results. The signature is `startEmailLinkFlow({ redirectUrl: string }) => Promise<EmailAddress>`.

The second function can be used to stop polling at any time, allowing for full control of the flow and cleanup. The signature is `cancelEmailLinkFlow() => void`.

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function createEmailLinkFlow(): {
  startEmailLinkFlow: (params: StartEmailLinkFlowParams) => Promise<EmailAddress>;
  cancelEmailLinkFlow: () => void;
};
```

#### Returns

`createEmailLinkFlow` returns an object with two functions:

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `startEmailLinkFlow` | <code>(params: [StartEmailLinkFlowParams](#start-email-link-flow-params)) => Promise\<EmailAddress></code> | Function to start the email link flow. It prepares a email link verification and polls for the verification result. |
| `cancelEmailLinkFlow` | `() => void` | Function to cleanup the email link flow. Stops waiting for verification results. |

#### `StartEmailLinkFlowParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `redirectUrl` | `string` | The email link target URL. Users will be redirected here once they click the email link from their email. |
