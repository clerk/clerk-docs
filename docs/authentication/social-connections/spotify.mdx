Learn how to set up a social connection with Spotify in your Clerk application.

## Overview

**Clerk does not currently support preconfigured shared OAuth credentials for Spotify on development instances.** You will have to provide custom credentials for both development _and_ production instances, which includes generating your own Client ID and Client Secret using your Spotify Developer account. Don't worry, this guide will walk you through that process in just a few simple steps.

> [!CAUTION]
> [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes) requires users to be added to the Spotify application's allowlist in order to allow them to connect to your Clerk application with Spotify OAuth. Each user who attempts to use your Clerk app in **development** with Spotify as their authentication method will need to be added to your app's allowlist before they can use it. _Your users may be able to log into your development Clerk app without having been allowlisted in Spotify. However, API requests with an access token associated to that user and Spotify app will receive a 403 status code error._

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Spotify developer account. To create one, [click here](https://developer.spotify.com/).

## Configuration

<Steps>
  ### Create a Spotify application

  To create a new OAuth Spotify app, go to the [Spotify Developer portal](https://developer.spotify.com/) and sign in. Once signed in, navigate to the [Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). Click on either of the **Create app** buttons.

  Once redirected to the application creation form, you need to set an **App name**, **App description**, and **Redirect URI**. **Website** is optional.

  ### Spotify + your Clerk app

  You can retrieve the **Redirect URI** from the Clerk Dashboard. But first, you need to enable Spotify as a social connection for your Clerk application.

  Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections). In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Spotify**.

  Toggle on **Use custom credentials** and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Configure Spotify application

  Navigate back to your Spotify app and paste the **Authorized redirect URI** you copied from the Clerk Dashboard into the **Redirect URIs** input.

  Agree to Spotify's terms and conditions and click **Save**.

  Once your Spotify app is created, you'll be redirected to the app dashboard. From there, navigate to **Settings**.

  Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Go back to the Clerk Dashboard, where the modal should still be open, and paste these values into the respective fields.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections). In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**. Select the settings cog icon next to the Spotify option. You can now paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.
