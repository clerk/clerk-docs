title: Migrate from Cognito
description: Seamlessly migrate AWS Cognito user passwords into Clerk.
---

## Overview

It is a known limitation that AWS Cognito does not include hashed passwords when listing user pool users.
This necessitates a password reset flow when migrating users to another platform.

To eliminate the need for a cumbersome password reset flow, Clerk provides a Cognito password migrator
that enables your end users to sign in to Clerk using their existing Cognito passwords.

In its barest form, it is simply two fields that you set on a Clerk `user` object, through
the [backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/CreateUser).

- `password_hasher`: `awscognito`
- `password_digest`: `awscognito#<COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID>#<COGNITO_CLIENT_ID>#<identifier>`

## Pre-flight checks

In AWS, you will need to ensure that your Cognito user pool has a **public** client with the `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` auth flow enabled.

You can create a new client for your user pool at any time from the AWS console or through the [AWS CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cognito-idp/create-user-pool-client.html)

> [!CAUTION]
> This step is critical for the migration to work as intended.

## One-time upload

For any Cognito user object that you’d wish to migrate, you will need to have an equivalent Clerk user object,
with the `password_hasher` and `password_digest` fields set.

Below is one method of conducting a batch upload of your Cognito users into Clerk.
However, you are not limited to this approach, nor does it impact the migration flow.

Ensure that you are using `node >= v20`, and run the following to create a new script directory and project.

```shell {{ title: '~/' }}
user@~: $ mkdir cognito_to_clerk
user@~: $ cd cognito_to_clerk

user@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ npm init -y
user@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ npm i -E @aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider@3.614.0
user@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ npm i -E @clerk/backend@1.4.3

user@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ touch .env
user@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ touch main.ts
```

Fill in the `.env` file with your AWS and Clerk credentials.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Always double check that the `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` points to the desired Clerk instance (development vs. production)
> - The `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` should be the public client ID that you created earlier in the [Pre-flight checks](#pre-flight-checks) section.

```shell {{ title: '~/cognito_to_clerk/.env' }}
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=

COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=

CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
```

The provided script below lists your Cognito user pool users, calls
`CreateUser` for each user, and sets the `password_hasher` and `password_digest` fields.

> [!CAUTION]
> As usual, rate limits apply to the `CreateUser` endpoint. [^1]

[^1]: [`CreateUser`](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/CreateUser){{ target: '_blank' }} has a rate limit rule of 20 requests per 10 seconds.

const idpClient = new IDP.CognitoIdentityProviderClient({
  region: AWS_REGION,

    accessKeyId: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,

const clerk = createClerkClient({

async function main() {
  const usersResponse = await idpClient.send(
    new IDP.ListUsersCommand({ UserPoolId: COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID }),
  )
  if (!usersResponse.Users) {
    throw new Error('No users found')
  }

  usersLoop: for (const cognitoUser of usersResponse.Users) {
    // Skip unconfirmed users or EXTERNAL_PROVIDER users (like Facebook, Google, etc)
    if (cognitoUser.UserStatus !== 'CONFIRMED') {
      console.log(
        'Skipping user: User is not confirmed:',
        cognitoUser.Username,
        cognitoUser.UserStatus,
      )
      continue
    }

    // This identifier must match the one that use used for sign in on the Cognito user pool.
    // Note that in AWS, this option is only configurable at the time of user creation.
    let identifier: string
    // Comment/Uncomment the block(s) below to use the identifier from the Cognito user pool.
    {
      identifier = cognitoUser.Attributes?.find((a) => a.Name === 'sub')!.Value!
    }
    {
      identifier = cognitoUser.Attributes?.find((a) => a.Name === 'email')!.Value!
    }
    {
      identifier = cognitoUser.Username!
    }

    if (!identifier) {
      console.log('Skipping user: No identifier found:', cognitoUser)
      continue
    }

    const email = cognitoUser.Attributes?.find((a) => a.Name === 'email')!.Value!

    try {
      await clerk.users.createUser({
        emailAddress: [email],
        passwordDigest: `awscognito#${COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID}#${COGNITO_CLIENT_ID}#${identifier}`,
        // @ts-expect-error - awscognito works, but is not a valid TypeScript yet
        passwordHasher: 'awscognito',
      })
      console.log('Created clerk user for:', identifier)
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500))
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err)
      break usersLoop
    }
  }
}

main()
```

Run the batch upload script.

```shell {{ title: '~/cognito_to_clerk' }}
user@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ npx tsx --env-file=.env main.ts
```

## Post-upload

Once you have users with the special hasher and digest in your Clerk instance,
you will be able to validate the migration behavior.

<Steps>
  ### Validate

  We recommend validating the integration by taking a single user whose
  Cognito password you know, such as your own, uploading it to Clerk with
  the special `awscognito` hasher and custom digest, and then attempting to sign in
  via your Clerk instance’s managed Account Portal.

  If the password is correct, sign in should work seamlessly.

  > [!TIP]
  > If at any point you need to _reset_, you can delete the user via the Clerk dashboard, and restart the process.
  >
  > This validation may be performed on both your `development` and `production` instances.

  ### Rollout changes

  Up until this point, you were possibly using the Cognito hosted UI for your application’s user sign-in.
  With the [one-time upload](#one-time-upload) out of the way and integration validated, you should be ready to
  update your application to use Clerk’s managed [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview) or the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component.

  Your end users will now be able to sign in to Clerk using their existing passwords without any password reset required.
</Steps>

As users successfully sign in to Clerk, their passwords will be re-hashed, and stored securely. No plaintext passwords are ever stored.
