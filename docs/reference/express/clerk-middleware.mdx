---

The `clerkMiddleware()` function checks the request's cookies and headers for a session JWT and if found, attaches the [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object to the `request` object under the `auth` key. **It must be set before any other middleware.**

> [!TIP]
> Even if you are using [`requireAuth()`](/docs/reference/express/require-auth) middleware, you should still use `clerkMiddleware()` as it will provide authentication state to routes that don't use `requireAuth()`. See the [example](#example-use-clerk-middleware-require-auth-and-get-auth-together).

```js
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

const app = express()

// Pass no parameters
app.use(clerkMiddleware())

// Pass options
app.use(clerkMiddleware(options))
```

## Example: Use `clerkMiddleware()`, `requireAuth()`, and `getAuth()` together

The following example demonstrates how to use `clerkMiddleware()`, [`requireAuth()`](/docs/reference/express/require-auth), and [`getAuth()`](/docs/reference/express/get-auth) together. `clerkMiddleware()` will provide authentication state to routes that don't use `requireAuth()`, `requireAuth()` will provide authentication state to a route and also protect the route based on authentication status, and `getAuth()` can be used in a number of ways. In this example, `getAuth()` is used to protect the route based on authorization status.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware, getAuth, requireAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const PORT = 3000

// Apply `clerkMiddleware()` to all routes
app.use(clerkMiddleware())

// Use `getAuth()` to protect a route based on authorization status
const hasPermission = (req, res, next) => {
  const auth = getAuth(req)

  // Handle if the user is not authorized
  if (!auth.has({ permission: 'org:admin:example' })) {
    return res.status(403).send('Forbidden')
  }

  return next()
}

// Use `requireAuth()` to protect a route based on authentication status
// If user is not authenticated, requireAuth() will redirect back to the homepage
// Then, use the `hasPermission` function created above to protect the route based on authorization status
app.get('/path', requireAuth(), hasPermission, (req, res) => res.json(req.auth))

// This route is not protected but it will have authentication state
// attached to the request object because `clerkMiddleware()` was applied to all routes
app.get('/path2', (req, res) => res.json(req.auth))

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`)
})
```

### `clerkMiddleware()` options

<Include src="_partials/clerk-middleware-options" />

<Properties>
  - `clerkClient`
  - [`ClerkClient`](/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart#create-clerk-client-options)

  An instance of the `ClerkClient` class. This is used to interact with the Clerk API.

  ---

  - `debug`
  - `boolean`

  A flag to enable debug mode. When set to `true`, the middleware will log debug information to the console. Defaults to `false`.

  ---

  - `enableHandshake`
  - `boolean`

  A flag to enable Clerk's handshake flow, which helps verify the session state when a session JWT has expired. It issues a `307` redirect to refresh the session JWT if the user is still logged in. Defaults to `true`.
