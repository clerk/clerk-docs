Retrieves a single [`Organization`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization).

```ts
function getOrganization(params: GetOrganizationParams): Promise<Organization>
```

## `GetOrganizationParams`

<Properties>
  - `organizationId | slug`
  - `string`

  The ID of the Organization to retrieve, or the slug of the Organization to retrieve.
</Properties>

## Examples

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

### Retrieve by ID

```tsx
const organizationId = 'org_123'

const response = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganization({ organizationId })
```

### Retrieve by slug

Retrieve an Organization by its slug instead of its ID.

```tsx
const slug = 'my-organization-slug'

const response = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganization({ slug })
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/organizations/{organization_id}`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/organizations/get/organizations/\{organization_id}){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
