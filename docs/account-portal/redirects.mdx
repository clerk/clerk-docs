# Custom Redirects


With the Account Portal, we default the user back to where they came from after a successful auth event (sign in or sign up) and pass this parameter via a `redirect_url` query param.

For situations where this may not be possible, Clerk defaults to your application homepage and expects the appropriate redirects will kick in. You can also specify default fallbacks directly in the dashboard as well. 

- **After sign-up fallback**: Define the landing page or a specific section of your application where users should be redirected to after successfully creating a new account.
- **After sign-in fallback**: Define the landing page or a specific section of your application where users should be directed after a successful sign-in.
- **After Logo Click**: Specify the destination page or action users should be redirected to after they click on your logo from the Account Portal pages.
