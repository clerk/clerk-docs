Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Express backend for secure user authentication and management. This guide focuses on backend implementation and requires a Clerk frontend SDK to function correctly.

<Steps>
  ## Install `@clerk/express`

  The [Clerk Express SDK](/docs/references/express/overview) provides a range of backend utilities to simplify user authentication and management in your application.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/express
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/express
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/express
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun add @clerk/express
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable and Secret Keys.
    1. Paste your keys into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```sh {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  This guide uses `dotenv` to load the environment variables. Run the following command to install it:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install dotenv
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add dotenv
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add dotenv
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun add dotenv
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ## Add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app

  The [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/references/express/overview#clerk-middleware) function checks the request's cookies and headers for a session JWT and, if found, attaches the [`Auth`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }} object to the `request` object under the `auth` key.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts', mark: [3, 8] }}
  import 'dotenv/config'
  import express from 'express'
  import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

  const app = express()
  const PORT = 3000

  app.use(clerkMiddleware())

  // Start the server and listen on the specified port
  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`)
  })
  ```

  ## Protect your routes using `requireAuth()`

  To protect your routes, use the [`requireAuth()`](/docs/references/express/overview#require-auth) middleware. This middleware functions similarly to `clerkMiddleware()`, but also protects your routes by redirecting unauthenticated users to the sign-in page.

  In the following example, `requireAuth()` is used to protect the `/protected` route. If the user isn't authenticated, they're redirected to the homepage. If the user is authenticated, the [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/express/overview#get-auth) function is used to get the `userId`, which is passed to [`clerkClient.users.getUser()`](/docs/references/backend/user/get-user){{ target: '_blank' }} to fetch the current user's `User` object.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts' }}
  import 'dotenv/config'
  import express from 'express'
  import { clerkClient, requireAuth, getAuth } from '@clerk/express'

  const app = express()
  const PORT = 3000

  // Use requireAuth() to protect this route
  // If user isn't authenticated, requireAuth() will redirect back to the homepage
  app.get('/protected', requireAuth(), async (req, res) => {
    // Use `getAuth()` to get the user's `userId`
    const { userId } = getAuth(req)

    // Use Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK to get the user's User object
    const user = await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId)

    return res.json({ user })
  })

  // Start the server and listen on the specified port
  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`)
  })
  ```

  ## Add global TypeScript type (optional)

  If you're using TypeScript, add a global type reference to your project to enable auto-completion and type checking for the `auth` object in Express request handlers.

  1. In your application's root folder, create a `types/` directory.
  1. Inside this directory, create a `globals.d.ts` file with the following code.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'types/globals.d.ts' }}
  /// <reference types="@clerk/express/env" />
  ```
