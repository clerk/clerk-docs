# Getting started with the Account Portal  

To integrate the Account Portal into your application, you need to simply follow one of our [quickstart guides](/docs/quickstarts/overview). 

Once your application is set up, all you have to do is fire it up. Clerk will automatically redirect your users to the Account Portal sign-in/sign-up pages. Once a user has successfully authenticated themself, they will be automatically be redirected back to your application with an active session.

  **Dynamic Development Host Detection**  

  For development environments, the development host (e.g. http://localhost:3000) is dynamically detected by Clerk at runtime and tied to your client browser. We store this as the ‘home origin’ for your application and it is equivalent to your application domain in production environments.
