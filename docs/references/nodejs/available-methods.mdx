# Node.js Available Methods

All resource operations are mounted as sub-APIs on the `clerkClient` object. You can find the full list of available operations in the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) documentation. To access a resource, you must first instantiate a `clerkClient` instance.

## Instantiate a default `clerkClient` instance

If you would like to use the default instance of `clerkClient` provided by the SDK, you can provide the `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` as an environment variable and instantiate `clerkClient` without passing configuration options.

<Tabs items={["ESM", "CJS"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```js {{ prettier: false }}
    import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

    const userList = await clerkClient.users.getUserList();
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```js {{ prettier: false }}
    const pkg = require('@clerk/clerk-sdk-node');
    const clerkClient = pkg.default;

    clerkClient.sessions
      .getSessionList()
      .then((sessions) => console.log(sessions))
      .catch((error) => console.error(error));
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Instantiate a custom `clerkClient` instance

If you would like to customize the behavior of the SDK, you can instantiate a `clerkClient` instance yourself by calling `createClerkClient` and passing in [options](#customizing-resources).

The example below shows how to use `createClerkClient` to create a `clerkClient` instance and pass a Clerk secret key _instead of_ setting a `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["ESM", "CJS"]}>
  ```js {{ prettier: false }}
  import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

  const clerkClient = createClerkClient({ secretKey: '{{secret}}' });

  const clientList = await clerkClient.clients.getClientList();
  ```

  ```js {{ prettier: false }}
  const Clerk = require('@clerk/clerk-sdk-node/cjs/instance').default;

  const clerkClient = Clerk({ secretKey: '{{secret}}' });

  clerkClient.sessions
    .getSessionList()
    .then((sessions) => console.log(sessions))
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Customizing resources

The following options are available for you to customize the behaviour of the `clerkClient` object.

> [!NOTE]
> Most options can also be set as environment variables so that you don't need to pass anything to the constructor.

| Option | Description | Default | Environment variable |
| - | - | - | - |
| `secretKey` | Server key for `api.clerk.com`. Can be found in your Clerk Dashboard on the **[API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)** page. | none | `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` |
| `apiVersion` | API version to use | `v4` | `CLERK_API_VERSION` |
| `apiUrl` | For debugging | `https://api.clerk.com` | `CLERK_API_URL` |
| `httpOptions` | HTTP client options | `{}` | N/A |

{/* TODO: I think more of a description and example can be added for httpOptions. Also, we need to add information for audience, proxyUrl, jwtKey, publishableKey, domain, isSallite, telemetry */}

For every option, the resolution is as follows, in order of descending precedence:

- option passed
- environment variable (if applicable)
- default

This means that if you pass an option to the constructor, it will always take precedence over an environment variable.

Another available environment variable is `CLERK_LOGGING`. You can set its value to `true` to enable additional logging that may be of use when debugging an issue.
