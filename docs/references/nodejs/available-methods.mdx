# Node.js Available Methods

All resource operations are mounted as sub-APIs on the `clerkClient` object. You can find the full list of available operations in the [Clerk Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) documentation. To access a resource, you must first instantiate a `clerkClient` instance.

## Instantiate a default `clerkClient` instance

If you would like to use the default instance of `clerkClient` provided by the SDK, you can provide the `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` as an environment variable and instantiate `clerkClient` without passing configuration options.

<Tabs items={["ESM", "CJS"]}>
  <Tab>
  ```js
  import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

  const userList = await clerkClient.users.getUserList();
  ```

  If you are interested in a certain resource, you can destructure `clerkClient` to access just that resource.:

  ```js
  import { sessions } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

  const sessionList = await sessions.getSessionList();
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
  ```js
  const pkg = require('@clerk/clerk-sdk-node');
  const clerkClient = pkg.default;

  clerkClient.sessions
    .getSessionList()
    .then((sessions) => console.log(sessions))
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  ```

  Or if you prefer a resource sub-api directly:

  ```js
  const pkg = require('@clerk/clerk-sdk-node');
  const { clients } = pkg;

  clients
    .getClient(clientId)
    .then((client) => console.log(client))
    .catch((error) => console.error(error));
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Instantiate a custom `clerkClient` instance

If you would like to customize the behavior of the SDK, you can instantiate a `clerkClient` instance yourself by calling `createClerkClient` and passing in [options](#customizing-resources).

The example below shows how to use `createClerkClient` to create a `clerkClient` instance and pass a Clerk secret key *instead of* setting a `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.

<InjectKeys>

<CodeBlockTabs options={["ESM", "CJS"]}>
```js
import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';

const clerkClient = createClerkClient({ secretKey: '{{secret}}' });

const clientList = await clerkClient.clients.getClientList();
```

```js
const Clerk = require('@clerk/clerk-sdk-node/cjs/instance').default;

const clerkClient = Clerk({ secretKey: '{{secret}}' });

clerkClient.sessions
  .getSessionList()
  .then((sessions) => console.log(sessions))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

</InjectKeys>

### Customizing resources

The following options are available for you to customize the behaviour of the `clerkClient` object.

<Callout type="info">
  Most options can also be set as environment variables so that you don't need to pass anything to the constructor.
</Callout>

| Option | Description | Default | Environment variable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `secretKey` | Server key for `api.clerk.com`. Can be found in your Clerk Dashboard on the **[API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)** page. | none | `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` |
| `apiVersion` | API version to use | `v4` | `CLERK_API_VERSION` |
| `apiUrl` | For debugging | `https://api.clerk.com` | `CLERK_API_URL` |
| `httpOptions` | HTTP client options | `{}` | N/A |

{/* TODO: I think more of a description and example can be added for httpOptions. Also, we need to add information for audience, proxyUrl, jwtKey, publishableKey, domain, isSallite, telemetry */}

For every option, the resolution is as follows, in order of descending precedence:

- option passed
- environment variable (if applicable)
- default

This means that if you pass an option to the constructor, it will always take precedence over an environment variable.

Another available environment variable is `CLERK_LOGGING`. You can set its value to `true` to enable additional logging that may be of use when debugging an issue.
