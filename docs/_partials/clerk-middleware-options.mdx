<Properties>
  - `audience?`
  - `string | string[]`

  A string or list of [audiences](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3). If passed, it is checked against the `aud` claim in the token.

  ---

  - `authorizedParties?`
  - `string[]`

  An allowlist of origins to verify against, to protect your application from the subdomain cookie leaking attack. For example: `['http://localhost:3000', 'https://example.com']`

  ---

  - `clockSkewInMs?`
  - `number`

  Specifies the allowed time difference (in milliseconds) between the Clerk server (which generates the token) and the clock of the user's application server when validating a token. Defaults to 5000 ms (5 seconds).

  - `string`

  The domain used for satellites to inform Clerk where this application is deployed.

  ---

  - `isSatellite?`
  - `boolean`

  When using Clerk's satellite feature, this should be set to `true` for secondary domains.

  - `jwtKey`
  - `string`

  Used to verify the session token in a networkless manner. Supply the **JWKS Public Key** from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard. **It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables) instead.** For more information, refer to [Manual JWT verification](/docs/backend-requests/manual-jwt).

If there's a mismatch between the active organization in the session (e.g., as reported by [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth)) and the organization indicated by the URL, the middleware will attempt to activate the organization specified in the URL.
