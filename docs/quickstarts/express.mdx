Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Express backend for secure user authentication and management. This guide covers backend implementation only and requires a Clerk frontend SDK in order for any of this to work.

<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/express`

  Clerk's [Express SDK](/docs/references/express/overview) ships with a variety of helpers for the backend to make user authentication easier.

  To get started using Clerk with Express, add the SDK to your project:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/express
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/express
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/express
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
    1. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
    1. Paste your keys into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```sh {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  This guide uses `dotenv` to load the environment variables. Install the package by running the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install dotenv
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add dotenv
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add dotenv
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Add `clerkMiddleware()` to your application

  The [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/references/express/overview#clerk-middleware) function checks the request's cookies and headers for a session JWT and, if found, attaches the [Auth](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#auth-object) object to the request object under the `auth` key.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts', mark: [3, 7] }}
  import 'dotenv/config'
  import express from 'express'
  import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

  const app = express()

  app.use(clerkMiddleware())

  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`)
  })
  ```

  You can then use the [`getAuth`](/docs/references/express/overview#get-auth) helper to access the authentication state in any route:

  ```ts
  import { getAuth } from '@clerk/express'

  app.get('/auth', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ auth: getAuth(req) })
  })
  ```

  ### Protect your routes using `requireAuth()`

  To protect your routes, use the [`requireAuth`](/docs/references/express/overview#require-auth) middleware. This middleware functions similarly to `clerkMiddleware()`, but also protects your routes by redirecting unauthenticated users to the sign-in page.

  In this example, if the user is authenticated, it retrieves the `userId` using the `getAuth()` helper and uses it with `clerkClient.users.getUser()` to fetch the current user's `User` object. If the user is not authenticated, they are redirected to the '/sign-in' route.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts', mark: [3, [7, 11], [13, 16]] }}
  import 'dotenv/config'
  import express from 'express'
  import { clerkClient, getAuth, requireAuth } from '@clerk/express'

  const app = express()

  app.get('/protected', requireAuth({ signInUrl: '/sign-in' }), (req, res) => {
    const { userId } = getAuth(req)
    const user = await clerkClient.users.getUser()
    return res.json({ user })
  })

  app.get('/sign-in', (req, res) => {
    // Assuming you have a template engine installed
    res.render('sign-in')
  })

  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${PORT}`)
  })
  ```
