## Access user data in the backend

By using Clerk's [`GetUserList`](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/GetUserList){{ target: '_blank' }} Backend API endpoint, you can programmatically export your user's data safely.

Additionally, the [`getUserList()`](/docs/references/backend/user/get-user-list) method in the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) can also be used to retrieve a list of users.

## Export your users' data from the Clerk Dashboard

Users who are either admins or are in their personal workspace can export and download a CSV file containing a list of their application's users that _includes their hashed passwords_. Users can also view detailed export and download history logs. These logs offer a record of previous export actions, ensuring visibility and traceability of data exports.

To export your users' data:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=exports).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, under **Application**, select **Exports**.
1. Select the **Export all users** button.
1. A new entry in the export history will appear. Select the **Download** button to download the CSV file.
