# Overview

Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your Next.js application. Looking to get started? Check out our [getting started guide](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs). If you want to learn more about the capabilities and methods available from Clerk's Next.js SDK, check out the reference content below.

## `authMiddleware()`

The `authMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Next.js application through middleware. It allows you to integrate authorization into both the client and server of your application. You can learn more [here](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware).

## App Router

Clerk provides first-class support for the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app). The below methods and references show how to integrate Clerk features into applications that take advantage of the latest App Router and React Server Components features.

- [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth)
- [`currentUser()`](/docs/references/nextjs/current-user)
- [Route Handlers](/docs/references/nextjs/route-handlers)
- [Server Actions](/docs/references/nextjs/server-actions)

## Pages Router

Clerk continues to provide drop-in support for the Next.js Pages Router. In addition to the main Clerk integration, several methods are available for instrumenting authentication within Pages Router-based applications.

- [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth)
- [`buildClerkProps()`](/docs/references/nextjs/build-clerk-props)
