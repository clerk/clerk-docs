In the previous step, the `cssLayerName` property is set on the `<ClerkProvider>` component. Now, you need to **add the following line to the top of your `globals.css` file** in order to include the layer you named in the `cssLayerName` property. The example names the layer `clerk` but you can name it anything you want. These steps are necessary for v4 of Tailwind as it ensures that Tailwind's utility styles are applied after Clerk's styles.

```css {{ filename: 'globals.css' }}
+ @layer theme, base, clerk, components, utilities;
  @import 'tailwindcss';
```
