The `PhoneNumber` object describes a phone number. Phone numbers can be used as a proof of identification for users, or simply as a means of contacting users.

Phone numbers must be **verified** to ensure that they can be assigned to their rightful owners. The `PhoneNumber` object holds all the necessary state around the verification process.

The verification process consists of two steps:

- The verification process always starts with the [`prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification) method, which will send a one-time verification code via an SMS message.
- The second and final step involves an attempt to complete the verification by calling the [`attemptVerification()`](#attempt-verification) method, passing the one-time code as a parameter.

Finally, phone numbers can be used as part of [multi-factor authentication](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options#multi-factor-authentication). During sign in, users can opt in to an extra verification step where they will receive an SMS message with a one-time code. This code must be entered to complete the sign in process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SMS functionality, including SMS [OTPs](!otp), is restricted to phone numbers from countries that are enabled on your [SMS allowlist](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options#sms-allowlist). This can be useful for avoiding extraneous SMS fees from countries from which your app is not expected to attract traffic. **By default, only the US and Canada are enabled.**

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `id`
  - `string`

  The unique identifier for this phone number.

  ---

  - `phoneNumber`
  - `string`

  The value of this phone number, in [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164).

  ---

  - `reservedForSecondFactor`
  - `boolean`

  Set to `true` if this phone number is reserved for multi-factor authentication (2FA). Set to `false` otherwise.

  ---

  - `defaultSecondFactor`
  - `boolean`

  ---

  - `verification`
  - [`Verification`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/verification)

  An object holding information on the verification of this phone number.

  ---

  - `linkedTo`
  - `Array<{id: string, type: string}>`

## Methods

### `create()`

Creates a new phone number for the current user.

```typescript
function create(): Promise<PhoneNumber>
```

### `destroy()`

Deletes this phone number.

```typescript
function destroy(): Promise<void>
```

### `toString()`

Returns the in [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) which includes the country code and the phone number.. Can also be accessed via the `PhoneNumber.phoneNumber` attribute.

```typescript
function toString(): string
```

### `prepareVerification()`

Kick off the verification process for this phone number. An SMS message with a one-time code will be sent to the phone number value.

```typescript
function prepareVerification(): Promise<PhoneNumber>
```

### `attemptVerification()`

Attempts to verify this phone number, passing the one-time code that was sent as an SMS message. The code will be sent when calling the [`PhoneNumber.prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification) method.

```typescript
function attemptVerification(params: AttemptPhoneNumberVerificationParams): Promise<PhoneNumber>
```

### `AttemptPhoneNumberVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `code`
  - `string`

  The one-time code that was sent to the user's phone number when `prepareVerification` was called.
</Properties>

### `makeDefaultSecondFactor()`

Marks this phone number as the default second factor for [multi-factor authentication](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-password-mfa)(2FA). A user can have exactly one default second factor.

```typescript
function makeDefaultSecondFactor(): Promise<PhoneNumber>
```

### `setReservedForSecondFactor()`

Marks this phone number as reserved for [multi-factor authentication](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-password-mfa) (2FA) or not.

```typescript
function setReservedForSecondFactor(params: SetReservedForSecondFactorParams): Promise<PhoneNumber>
```

#### `SetReservedForSecondFactorParams`

<Properties>
  - `reserved`
  - `boolean`

  Pass `true` to mark this phone number as reserved for 2FA, or `false` to disable 2FA for this phone number.
