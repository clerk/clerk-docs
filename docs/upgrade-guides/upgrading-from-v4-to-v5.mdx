title: Upgrading from v4 to v5
description: Learn how to upgrade from version 4 to version 5 of the Clerk JavaScript libraries.

# Upgrading from v4 to v5

Clerk's SDKs include React, Next.js, Remix, Gatsby, Redwood, and others. This guide helps you with uprading to the next major version of your SDK.

Version 5 ships with an improved design and UX for its built-in components, no "flash of white page" when authenticating, and a new middleware for Next.js which defaults to not protecting any routes. Along with these highly requested features some smaller DX improvements and housekeeping items made its way into the release. If you want to know everything that's new, read the [v5 announcement post](https://clerk.com/changelog/2024-01-16).

<Callout type="info" >
  Version 5/v5 refers to the [`@clerk/clerk-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clerk/clerk-js) package version. However, other SDKs like `@clerk/backend` or `@clerk/clerk-expo` are versioned independently (and would upgrade from v1 to v2). To make this page easier to read for instances of general advice only v5 is mentioned. You can think of v4 as the previous major of your SDK and v5 as the current in those cases.
</Callout>

If you're curious about Clerk's approach to versioning and support, head to the [long term support](/docs/upgrade-guides/long-term-support) document. Version 5 includes [potentially breaking changes](#breaking-changes), as well as the removal of [previously deprecated features](#previously-deprecated-features).

For most users we expect a smooth upgrade path as only a couple of changes will be required: [Update dependencies](#update-dependencies), run the `@clerk/upgrade` CLI, [update Clerk](#update-clerk), and handle any [breaking changes](#breaking-changes).

## Handle deprecations

Before uprading, Clerk highly recommends updating your packages to the latest v4 version. Some changes required for v5 can be applied incrementally to the latest v4, which should contribute to a smoother upgrading experience.

You can use your package manager to find the possible upgrades:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm outdated
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn upgrade-interactive
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm upgrade -i
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

After updating, look out for deprecation messages in your terminal and browser console. By resolving these deprecations you'll be able to skip some breaking changes for v5.

As of this major version Clerk also provides a `@clerk/upgrade` CLI you can use to ease the upgrade. A questionnaire will ask you a couple of questions and afterwards you'll get a list of changes you'll need to apply to your project. Navigate to your project and run it in the terminal:

```bash filename="terminal"
npx @clerk/upgrade
```

## Update dependencies

This section explains breaking changes for peer dependencies and tooling. In order to successfully upgrade, you need to resolve these changes. Clerk's SDKs enforce these requirements through setting `peerDependencies` and `engines` keys in their `package.json`.

**Update Node.js**

All SDKs that rely on Node.js require you to have Node.js 18.17.0 or later installed. Last year Node.js 16 entered EOL (End of life) status so it's time to bump the required version for Clerk, too. Learn how to [update and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs).

**Update React**

All SDKs that rely on React require you to use React 18. You can update your project by installing the latest version of `react` and `react-dom`.

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add install react@latest react-dom@latest
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add install react@latest react-dom@latest
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

**Update Next.js**

If you're using `@clerk/nextjs` you will need to update your Next.js project to 13.0.4 or later. Check out Next's upgrade guides:

- [Upgrading from 12 to 13](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/version-13)
- [Upgrading from 13 to 14](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/version-14)

## Update Clerk

TODO

## Breaking Changes

This section explains breaking changes that were made across SDKs or only in individual ones. In order to successfully upgrade, you need to resolve these changes. All documentation is updated to refer to only the current, supported code.

### `@clerk/backend`

#### Response payload

<Callout type="warning">
  Please take extra care in reading the instructions for the new response payload.
</Callout>

The response payload of **every** backend API request was changed. Instead of returning the data on success and throwing an error on failure, you'll receive this object:

```ts
type ClerkBackendApiResponse<T> =
  | {
      data: T;
      errors: null;
      totalCount?: number;
    }
  | {
      data: null;
      errors: Array<ClerkAPIError>;
      totalCount?: never;
      clerkTraceId?: string;
      status?: number;
      statusText?: string;
    }
```

So on most requests you'll get back `{ data, errors }`. For requests that contain pagination information or where `data` is an array, you'll also receive `totalCount`. If an error happens, you'll get `errors` and in most cases also `clerkTraceId`, `status`, and `statusText`.

<Callout type="warning" > 
  You'll need to throw errors yourself as the `@clerk/backend` functions are not handling this for you anymore. See the examples below on how to do that. 
</Callout>

The new API looks like this:

```ts
// Single
const { data, errors } = await clerkClient.users.getUser("")

// Paginated response
const {
  data,
  errors,
  totalCount
} = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList()
```

If you want to keep the old behavior, you can migrate your code to something like this:

```ts
import { createClerkClient } from "@clerk/backend"
import { ClerkAPIResponseError } from "@clerk/shared/error"

const clerkClient = createClerkClient({ secretKey: "" })

const { 
  data,
  errors,
  status,
  statusText
} = await clerkClient.users.getUser("")

if (errors) {
  throw new ClerkAPIResponseError(statusText, { data: errors, status })
}
```

Here's the changed response shape in a before and after:

```diff
- const data = await clerkClient.users.getUser("")
+ const { data } = await clerkClient.users.getUser("")

- const data = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList()
- const totalCount = data.length
+ const {
+  data,
+  totalCount
+ } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList()
```

Here are some more examples of this change.

<Accordion titles={["sessions.getToken()", "signJwt, hasValidSignature, decodeJwt, verifyJwt, and verifyToken functions",]} heading="h5">
  <AccordionPanel>
    ```diff
    - const jwtString = await clerkClient.sessions.getToken({
    -   template: "" 
    - })
    + const { data, errors } = await clerkClient.sessions.getToken({
    +   template: "" 
    + })
    + const jwtString = data?.jwt
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    Their `errors` array will only ever have one item so you can [destructure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) it directly.

    ```js
    import {
      signJwt,
      hasValidSignature,
      decodeJwt,
      verifyJwt
    } from "@clerk/backend/jwt"
    import { verifyToken } from "@clerk/backend"

    const { data, errors: [error] } = await signJwt()
    if (error) throw error

    const { data, errors: [error] } = await hasValidSignature()
    if (error) throw error

    const { data, errors: [error] } = decodeJwt()
    if (error) throw error

    const { data, errors: [error] } = await verifyJwt()
    if (error) throw error

    const { data, errors: [error] } = await verifyToken()
    if (error) throw error
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

#### Other `@clerk/backend` changes

- The top level `Clerk` import was moved from a default export to a named `createClerkClient` export. It's a name change and functionality stayed the same.

    ```diff
    - import Clerk from "@clerk/backend"
    + import { createClerkClient } from "@clerk/backend"
    ```

- You need to pass a `Request` to the first argument of the `authenticateRequest()` method.

    ```diff
    - const state = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest({
    + const state = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(req, {
        secretKey: "",
        publishableKey: "",
    -   origin: req.headers.get("origin"),
    -   host: req.headers.get("host"),
    -   // ...etc
      })
    ```
- The `createEmail()` method (and as such the `emails` API endpoint) has been removed. For the time being no alternative method will be provided for creating and sending emails directly from Clerk's JavaScript SDKs. If you're currently relying on this functionality and wish to update, please reach out to [Clerk's support](/support).

### `@clerk/clerk-js`

#### Pagination response & parameters

<Callout type="warning">
  Please take extra care in reading the instructions for the modified shape of paginated responses and new pagination parameters.
</Callout>

For every method that returns a paginated list the [`ClerkPaginatedResponse`](/docs/references/javascript/types/clerk-paginated-response) has changed from `[Item]` to `{ total_count: number; data: [Item] }`.

The affected methods are:

- `Organization.getRoles()`
- `Organization.getDomains()`
- `Organization.getMembershipRequests()`
- `Organization.getMemberships()`
- `Organization.getInvitations()`
- `User.getOrganizationInvitations()`
- `User.getOrganizationSuggestions()`
- `User.getOrganizationMemberships()`

Here's a before/after example:

```diff
  import Clerk from "@clerk/clerk-js"

  const clerk = new Clerk()
  await clerk.load()

- const orgs = await clerk.user.getOrganizationMemberships()
+ const { data: orgs } = await clerk.user.getOrganizationMemberships()
```

The pagination parameters on some methods have changed from `{ limit: number; offset: number }` to `{ initialPage: number; pageSize: number }`.

The affected methods are:

- `Organization.getRoles()`
- `Organization.getDomains()`
- `Organization.getMembershipRequests()`
- `Organization.getMemberships()`
- `Organization.getInvitations()`
- `User.getOrganizationInvitations()`
- `User.getOrganizationSuggestions()`
- `User.getOrganizationMemberships()`

Here's a before/after example:

```diff
  import Clerk from "@clerk/clerk-js"

  const clerk = new Clerk()
  await clerk.load()

  const { data: orgs } = await clerk.user.getOrganizationMemberships({
-   limit: 10,
+   pageSize: 10,
-   offset: 10,
+   initialPage: 2,
  })
```

---

#### Other `@clerk/clerk-js` changes

- The [`User.update()`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user#update) method no longer accepts `password` as a parameter. If you'd like to update a users's password, please use [`User.updatePassword()`](/docs/references/javascript/user/password-management#update-password) instead.

    ```diff
    - User.update({ password: "new" })
    + User.updatePassword({ newPassword: "new" })
    ```

- The default values of `afterSignOutUrl`, `afterSignIn`, and `afterSignUp` have been changed to `/`. The URLs defined in your **Dashboard > Account Portal > Redirects** won't affect these anymore. Read the [Customizing your Account Portal redirects](/docs/account-portal/custom-redirects) to learn how to override these defaults.
- The `Clerk.redirectToHome()` method has been removed. You can use `Clerk.redirectToAfterSignUp()` or `Clerk.redirectAfterSignIn()` instead.

Some more niche use cases and their changes:

<Accordion titles={["Removal of unstable/experimental properties", "Removal of fallback data for paginated methods", "Appearance", "Use .imageUrl for image related responses/resources", "lastOrganizationInvitation and lastOrganizationMember events"]} heading="h5">
  <AccordionPanel>
    Removed the following properties:

    - `Clerk.experimental_canUseCaptcha`
    - `Clerk.experimental_captchaSiteKey`
    - `Clerk.experimental_captchaURL`
    - `Clerk.__unstable__invitationUpdate`
    - `Clerk.__unstable__membershipUpdate`

    There is no replacement for these experimental properties.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The following methods will now throw an error if one occurs, instead of catching it and returning an empty fallback as data.

    - `Organization.getDomains()`
    - `Organization.getInvitations()`
    - `Organization.getMembershipRequests()`
    - `Organization.getMemberships()`
    - `User.getOrganizationInvitations()`
    - `User.getOrganizationSuggestions()`
    - `User.getOrganizationMemberships()`

    It is recommended to wrap these in a `try/catch` block.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    These appearance props have changed:

    - `appearence.elements.organizationPreview__organizationSwitcher` => `appearence.elements.organizationPreview__organizationSwitcherTrigger`
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    Some image related properties have changed on class objects. See the full list below. As an example, here's how the user's profile image property changed:

    ```diff
      const clerk = new Clerk()
    - clerk.user.profileImageUrl
    + clerk.user.imageUrl
    ```

    Various image related properties were all aligned to `imageUrl`. So if you use any of these, change the property:

    - `ExternalAccount.avatarUrl`
    - `Organization.logoUrl`
    - `User.profileImageUrl`
    - `OrganizationMembershipPublicUserData.profileImageUrl`
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The `lastOrganizationInvitation` and `lastOrganizationMember` events for [`Clerk.addListener()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk#add-listener) have been removed. They were only relevant for internal usage and at the moment Clerk is not providing a way to achieve this functionality in another way. If you're currently relying on this functionality and wish to update, please reach out to [Clerk's support](/support).
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

### `@clerk/nextjs`

- [Change in default routing behavior](#routing)
- The named import `MultiSessionAppSupport` was moved from `@clerk/nextjs` to `@clerk/nextjs/internal`
- The `MembershipRole` type was replaced with `OrganizationCustomRoleKey` (related to [roles and permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions)). This TypeScript type can be found in such use cases:
    ```ts
    import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs"

    const { orgRole } = useAuth()
    ```
    
    To support the existing roles `admin`, `basic_member`, and `guest_member` apply interface merging using the following snippet:

    ```ts
    interface ClerkAuthorization {
      permission: ''
      role: 'admin' | 'basic_member' | 'guest_member'
    }
    ```

A couple of subpath imports have been removed. You should use `@clerk/nextjs` instead as the functionality stayed the same. In the case of the removed `@clerk/nextjs/api` subpath you can use `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node` instead.

<Accordion titles={["@clerk/nextjs/app-beta", "@clerk/nextjs/ssr", "@clerk/nextjs/edge-middleware", "@clerk/nextjs/edge-middlewarefiles", "@clerk/nextjs/api"]} heading="h4">
  <AccordionPanel>
    The `@clerk/nextjs` import will work with both the app and pages router.

    ```diff
    - import { } from "@clerk/nextjs/app-beta"
    + import { } from "@clerk/nextjs"
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The top-level imports support SSR by default now.

    ```diff
    - import { } from "@clerk/nextjs/ssr"
    + import { } from "@clerk/nextjs"
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    ```diff
    - import { } from "@clerk/nextjs/edge-middleware"
    + import { } from "@clerk/nextjs"
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    ```diff
    - import { } from "@clerk/nextjs/edge-middlewarefiles"
    + import { } from "@clerk/nextjs"
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The `@clerk/nextjs/api` subpath was removed completely. It re-exported helpers from `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node` and its types. If you relied on these, import from `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node` directly instead.

    ```diff
      import type {
        ClerkMiddleware,
        ClerkMiddlewareOptions,
        LooseAuthProp,
        RequireAuthProp,
        StrictAuthProp,
        WithAuthProp
    - } from "@clerk/nextjs/api"
    + } from "@clerk/clerk-sdk-node"

    - import { requireAuth, withAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/api"
    + import { requireAuth, withAuth } from "@clerk/clerk-sdk-node"
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

In recent versions Next.js enforced the convention that public environment variables should be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. This also applies to Clerk's environment variables. Please apply these changes:

<Accordion titles={["NEXT_PUBLIC_", "Renamed environment variables"]} heading="h4">
  <AccordionPanel>

  - `CLERK_JS_VERSION` => `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_JS_VERSION`

  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>

  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_JS` => `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_JS_URL`

  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

A couple of exported constants have been removed from `@clerk/nextjs` as you should use your defined environment variables instead.

<Accordion titles={["Removed constants"]} heading="h4">
  <AccordionPanel>
  Let's say you imported `API_URL` from `@clerk/nextjs`:

  ```ts
  import { API_URL } from "@clerk/nextjs"
  ```

  If you want to use it, set it in your environment variables as `CLERK_API_URL` and access it this way. Here's the whole changelog of converting the constants to environment variables:

  - `API_URL` => `CLERK_API_URL`
  - `API_VERSION` => `CLERK_API_VERSION`
  - `CLERK_JS_URL` => `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_JS_URL`
  - `CLERK_JS_VERSION` => `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_JS_VERSION`
  - `DOMAIN` => `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_DOMAIN`
  - `IS_SATELLITE` => `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_IS_SATELLITE`
  - `PROXY_URL` => `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PROXY_URL`
  - `PUBLISHABLE_KEY` => `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
  - `SECRET_KEY` => `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
  - `SIGN_IN_URL` => `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL`
  - `SIGN_UP_URL` => `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL`

  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

### `@clerk/clerk-react`

#### Routing

<Callout type="warning" > 
  Please take extra care in reading the instructions for the new routing behavior.
</Callout>

On components like [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) you can define the props `routing` and `path`. `routing` can be set to `'hash' | 'path' | 'virtual'` and describes the routing strategy that should be used. `path` defines where the component is mounted when `routing="path"` is used.

With Clerk v5 the **default** `routing` strategy has become `'path'`. Unless you change the `routing` prop, you'll need to define the `path` prop. The affected components are:

- `<SignIn />`
- `<SignUp />`
- `<UserProfile />`
- `<CreateOrganization />`
- `<OrganizationProfile />`

Here's how you'd use the components going forward:

```jsx
<SignIn path="/sign-in" />
<SignUp path="/sign-up" />
<UserProfile path="/user-profile" />
<CreateOrganization path="/create-org" />
<OrganizationProfile path="/org-profile" />
```

If you don't define the `path` prop an error will be thrown. Of course, you can still use `routing="hash"` or `routing="virtual"`.

```jsx
<UserProfile routing="hash" />
<OrganizationProfile routing="virtual" />
```

However, there are two exceptions to this behavior. If you're using `@clerk/nextjs` or `@clerk/remix`, you can set environment variables for `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />`.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["Next.js", "Remix"]}>
```env filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
```

```env filename=".env"
CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

**Only** if you're using one of these two frameworks and defined both environment variables, you're able to use the `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` components without any props.

```jsx
// Only works for Next.js / Remix when environment variables are set
<SignIn />
<SignUp />
```

#### Replace `navigate` with `routerPush` & `routerReplace`

The `navigate` prop on `<ClerkProvider>` allowed developers to override the default navigation behavior with a custom function. However, `navigate` was only able to push, not replace routes. The router is now able to do both, and as such, the props for `<ClerkProvider>` were updated. The `routerPush` and `routerReplace` props replace the old `navigate` prop.

For more information on what push and replace mean in relation to the browser history api, check out the ["Working with the History API"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API/Working_with_the_History_API) docs.

If you’d like to keep the same behavior as you had with the single `navigate` prop, pass the exact same function to both `routerPush` and `routerReplace`. For example:

```diff
- <ClerkProvider navigate={x => x} />
+ <ClerkProvider routerPush={x => x} routerReplace={x => x} />
```

---

#### Other `@clerk/clerk-react` changes

- Further changes to types:
    - `redirectToUserProfile` now returns `Promise<unknown>` instead of `void`
    - `redirectToOrganizationProfile` now returns `Promise<unknown>` instead of `void`
    - `redirectToCreateOrganization` now returns `Promise<unknown>` instead of `void`
    - `redirectToHome` now returns `Promise<unknown>` instead of `void`

### `@clerk/remix`

- [Change in default routing behavior](#routing)
- The `ClerkErrorBoundary` helper has been removed as it's no longer needed.

    ```diff
      import { rootAuthLoader } from "@clerk/remix/ssr.server"
    - import { ClerkApp, ClerkErrorBoundary } from "@clerk/remix"
    + import { ClerkApp } from "@clerk/remix"

      export const loader = (args: DataFunctionArgs) => {
        return rootAuthLoader(args);
      }

      export default ClerkApp(App)
    - export const ErrorBoundary = ClerkErrorBoundary()
    ```

### Other packages

#### `@clerk/chrome-extension`

- [Change in default routing behavior](#routing)
- The `tokenCache` prop on `<ClerkProvider>` was renamed to `storageCache`.

    ```diff
    - <ClerkProvider tokenCache={}>
    + <ClerkProvider storageCache={}>
    ```

    The `storageCache` interface has been expanded to allow more flexibility:

    ```ts
    type StorageCache = {
      createKey: (...keys: string[]) => string;
      get: <T = any>(key: string) => Promise<T>;
      remove: (key: string) => Promise<void>;
      set: (key: string, value: string) => Promise<void>;
    }
    ```

#### `@clerk/clerk-expo`

- If you're using the `navigate` prop on the `<ClerkProvider>` you'll need to [replace `navigate` with `routerPush` & `routerReplace`](#replace-navigate-with-router-push-router-replace)
- [Change in default routing behavior](#routing)

#### `gatsby-plugin-clerk`

- If you're using the `navigate` prop on the `<ClerkProvider>` you'll need to [replace `navigate` with `routerPush` & `routerReplace`](#replace-navigate-with-router-push-router-replace)
- [Change in default routing behavior](#routing)
- The return type and shape of `withServerAuth` was changed from `ServerSideAuth` to `AuthObject`. `props.auth` now returns different values:

    ```ts
    type V4 = {
      sessionId: string | null;
      userId: string | null;
      actor: ActJWTClaim | null;
      getToken: ServerGetToken;
      claims: ClerkJWTClaims | null;
    }

    type V5 = {
      sessionClaims: JwtPayload;
      sessionId: string;
      actor: ActClaim | undefined;
      userId: string;
      orgId: string | undefined;
      orgRole: OrganizationCustomRoleKey | undefined;
      orgSlug: string | undefined;
      orgPermissions: Array<OrganizationCustomPermissionKey> | undefined;
      getToken: ServerGetToken;
      has: CheckAuthorizationWithCustomPermissions;
      debug: AuthObjectDebug;
    }
    ```

- Changes to top-level imports in [`@clerk/clerk-react`](#clerk-clerk-react) will also affect `gatsby-plugin-clerk` as it just re-exports those.

#### `@clerk/localizations`

If you're using Clerk's [localization feature](/docs/components/customization/localization) to provide your own localizations, you will need to update your data as the underlying structure has changed. If you're just using one of Clerk's default localizations (e.g. through `import { frFR } from "@clerk/localizations"`) you need to install the latest version of `@clerk/localizations`.

The [en-US localization object](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/localizations/src/en-US.ts) has changed in three ways: New keys, deleted keys, and changed values.

<Accordion titles={["New localization keys", "Deleted localization keys", "Changed values"]} heading="h4">
  <AccordionPanel>
    New keys have been added to the default localization object. Add them to your existing configuration if you wish to customize them. Below you'll find the current values (as of writing this guide), if you wish to see the latest translations, go to the [en-US localization object](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/localizations/src/en-US.ts) on GitHub.

    ```js
    const newKeys = {
      formFieldInputPlaceholder__confirmDeletionUserAccount: "Delete account",
      formButtonPrimary__verify: "Verify",
      signIn: {
        forgotPassword: {
          title: "Reset password",
          subtitle_email: "First, enter the code sent to your email ID",
          subtitle_phone: "First, enter the code sent to your phone",
        },
        alternativeMethods: {
          subtitle: "Facing issues? You can use any of these methods to sign in.",
          actionText: "Don’t have any of these?",
        },
        accountSwitcher: {

    You could add these new keys to your existing configuration by using lodash's [`merge` function](https://lodash.com/docs/#merge).

    Some keys have been deleted from the default localization object. They are not used anymore and won't have any effect.

    We recommend removing these keys from your custom localization object. Alternatively, if you want to automate this, you could use lodash's [`omit` function](https://lodash.com/docs/#omit). Please note that this function can get slow on large objects.

    ```js
    import { omit } from "lodash-es"

    const localization = omit(yourOldOject, deletedKeys)
    ```

    For example, run this function once and save the output as your new object.

#### `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node`

Use `createClerkClient` and pass options to it instead of using these removed setters: `setClerkApiVersion`, `setClerkHttpOptions`, `setClerkServerApiUrl`, and `setClerkApiKey`.

```diff
- import { clerkClient, setClerkApiKey } from "@clerk/clerk-sdk-node"
+ import { createClerkClient } from "@clerk/clerk-sdk-node"

- setClerkApiKey("")
+ const clerkClient = createClerkClient({ secretKey: "" })
  await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId)
```

### Common

This section explains changes that were made **across** multiple packages. Depending on which package you use you'll need to change these common changes in multiple places.

#### `API_URL` value has changed

The `API_URL` export has changed from `https://api.clerk.dev` to `https://api.clerk.com`. Subsequently the default value for the `CLERK_API_URL` environment variable has also changed.

#### Component appearance

As mentioned in the [v5 announcement post](https://clerk.com/changelog/2024-01-16) Clerk's prebuilt components got a new look. These changes may impact your style customization applied through the `appearance` prop or class overrides. Internally some changes were made that might be a breaking change for you:

- Some borders are now implemented with the `box-shadow` property, not `border`

## Deprecated

The following deprecated features are no longer supported and documented. Please update your project as these deprecations will be dropped in v6.

### `authMiddleware`

The [`authMiddleware`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware) API from `@clerk/nextjs` has been marked as deprecated. We highly recommend using [`clerkMiddleware`](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware) going forward. `clerkMiddleware` protects no routes by default and you need to add your individual routes you want to opt into protection. Here's an example of having all routes public except for everything under `/dashboard`.

Before:

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs"

export default authMiddleware({
  publicRoutes: (req) => !req.url.includes("/dashboard"),
})

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
}
```

After:

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import {
  clerkMiddleware,
  createRouteMatcher
} from "@clerk/nextjs/server"
import { NextResponse } from "next/server"

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(["/dashboard(.*)"])

export default clerkMiddleware((auth, request) => {
  if (isProtectedRoute(request)) {
    auth().protect()
  }

  return NextResponse.next()
})

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
}
```

## Previously deprecated features

The following deprecated features have been entirely removed from any SDK and can no longer be used. It's recommended to first [handle any deprecations](#handle-deprecations) before trying the upgrade. In order to successfully upgrade, you need to resolve these changes and there will no longer be any supporting documentation for these old features.

<Callout type="info" >
  Use the `@clerk/upgrade` CLI to more quickly find these previously deprecated features:

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npx @clerk/upgrade
  ```
</Callout>

### Renamed: `apiKey`

The `CLERK_API_KEY` environment variable was renamed to `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`. Make sure to update this in all environments (e.g. dev, staging, production).

The `apiKey` parameter was renamed to `secretKey`. You are using this with `createClerkClient` for example.

You can visit your [Clerk dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) to copy/paste the new keys after choosing your framework.

### Removed: `frontendApi`

The `CLERK_FRONTEND_API` environment variable was removed. Use `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` on your frontend instead. Make sure to update this in all environments (e.g. dev, staging, production).

The `frontendApi` prop passed to `<ClerkProvider>` was removed and you should use `publishableKey`. The function parameter was also renamed (you are using this with `createClerkClient` for example).

<Callout type="warning" >
  The values are different, so this is not just a key replacement. You can visit your [Clerk dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) to copy/paste the new keys after choosing your framework.

### Renamed: Magic link

Across Clerk's documentation and codebases the term "magic link" was changed to "email link" as it more accurately reflects the functionality.

Inside your code, change the following values:

- `handleMagicLinkVerification` => `handleEmailLinkVerification`
- `isMagicLinkError` => `isEmailLinkError`
- `MagicLinkError` => `EmailLinkError`
- `MagicLinkErrorCode` => `EmailLinkErrorCode`
- `useMagicLink` => `useEmailLink`
- `createMagicLinkFlow()` => `createEmailLinkFlow()`

Functionality stayed the same and only the name changed.

### Removed: `setSession`

`setSession()` should be replaced with [`setActive()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods#set-active). The format of the parameters has changed slightly - `setActive` takes an object where `setSession` took params directly. The `setActive` function also can accept an `organization` param that is used to set the currently active organization. The return signature did not change. Read the [API documentation](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods#set-active) for more detail.

This function should be expected to be returned from one of the following Clerk hooks: `useSessionList`, `useSignUp`, or `useSignIn`. Some migration examples:

```diff
import { useSignIn } from "@clerk/clerk-react"

export default function SignIn() {
  const { setActive } = useSignIn()

- await setSession("sessionID", () => void)
+ await setActive({ session: "sessionID",  beforeEmit: () => void })

- await setSession(sessionObj)
+ await setActive({ session: sessionObj })

- await setSession(sessionObj, () => void)
+ await setActive({ session: sessionObj,  beforeEmit: () => void })
}
```

`setActive` also supports setting an active organization:

```js
await setActive({
  session: "sessionID",
  organization: "orgID",
  beforeEmit: () => void 
})
await setActive({
  session: sessionObj,
  organization: orgObj,
  beforeEmit: () => void
})
```

Or as part of the `Clerk` class of `@clerk/clerk-js`:

```js
import Clerk from "@clerk/clerk-js"

const clerkPublishableKey = ​your_publishable_key​
const clerk = new Clerk(clerkPublishableKey)
await clerk.load()

await clerk.setActive({ session: "" })
```

### Removed: `orgs` claim on JWT

In v4 of Clerk's SDKs, if you decode the session token that Clerk returns from the server, you'll currently find an `orgs` claim on it. It lists all the orgs associated with the given user. In v5 Clerk returns the `org_id`, `org_slug`, and `org_role` of the **active** organization.

The `orgs` claim was part of the `JwtPayload`. Here are a few examples of where the `JwtPayload` could be found.

  <AccordionPanel>
    ```typescript filename="Next.js"
    import { getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server"
    const claims: JwtPayload = getAuth(request).sessionClaims

    router.get("/me", async (req, reply: Response) => {
      return reply.json({ auth: req.auth })
    })
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

If you would like to have your JWT return all of the user's organizations, you can create a [custom JWT template](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates) in your dashboard. Add `{ "orgs": "user.organizations" }` to it.

### `@clerk/backend`

- `clockSkewInSeconds` was renamed to `clockSkewInMs` but the default value stayed the same. That change affects all methods related to `VerifyJwtOptions`.

    <Accordion titles={["Examples"]} heading="h5">
      <AccordionPanel>
        ```diff filename="verifyJwt"
          import { verifyJwt } from "@clerk/backend/jwt"

        - verifyJwt(jwt, { clockSkewInSeconds: 4000 })
        + verifyJwt(jwt, { clockSkewInMs: 4000 })
        ```

        ```diff filename="verifyToken"
          import { verifyToken } from "@clerk/backend"

        - verifyToken(token, { clockSkewInSeconds: 4000 })
        + verifyToken(token, { clockSkewInMs: 4000 })
        ```

        ```diff filename="authenticateRequest"
          import { createClerkClient } from "@clerk/backend"
          const clerk = createClerkClient({})

        - clerk.authenticateRequest(request, { clockSkewInSeconds: 4000 })
        + clerk.authenticateRequest(request, { clockSkewInMs: 4000 })
        ```

        ```diff filename="createAuthenticateRequest"
          import { createAuthenticateRequest } from "@clerk/backend/internal"
          const authenticateRequest = createAuthenticateRequest(params)

        - authenticateRequest(request, { clockSkewInSeconds: 4000 })
        + authenticateRequest(request, { clockSkewInMs: 4000 })
        ```

        ```diff filename="signedInAuthObject"
          import { signedInAuthObject } from "@clerk/backend/internal"

        - signedInAuthObject({ clockSkewInSeconds: 4000 }, sessionClaims)
        + signedInAuthObject({ clockSkewInMs: 4000 }, sessionClaims)
        ```

        ```diff filename="signedOutAuthObject"
          import { signedOutAuthObject} from "@clerk/backend/internal"

        - signedOutAuthObject({ clockSkewInSeconds: 4000 }, sessionClaims)
        + signedOutAuthObject({ clockSkewInMs: 4000 }, sessionClaims)
        ```
      </AccordionPanel>
    </Accordion>

    Also the following types are affected:
    - `import type { VerifyJwtOptions } from "@clerk/backend/jwt"`
    - `import type { VerifyTokenOptions } from "@clerk/backend"`
    - `import type { AuthenticateRequestOptions } from "@clerk/backend/internal"`

- Replace `organizations.getPendingOrganizationInvitationList` with `organizations.getOrganizationInvitationList` and pass a `status` parameter.

    ```diff
    - clerkClient.organizations.getPendingOrganizationInvitationList({
    -   ...params 
    - })
    + clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationInvitationList({
    +   ...params, status: "pending" 
    + })
    ```

Some more niche use cases and their changes.

<Accordion titles={["Removal of httpOptions", "Removal of pkgVersion", "Removal of createIsomorphicRequest & buildRequestUrl", "Use .imageUrl for image related responses/resources", "clerkClient.__unstable_options"]} heading="h4">
  <AccordionPanel>
    The `httpOptions` parameter was removed from the **internal** `buildRequest` function but it is used by most public facing APIs. Hence you were able to pass `httpOptions` to some functions which is not possible anymore. If you're currently relying on this functionality and wish to update, please reach out to [Clerk's support](/support).
    
    The internal change itself was:

    ```diff
    - const r = buildRequest({ httpsOptions: { headers: {} }})
    + const request = buildRequest()
    + request({ headerParams: {} })
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The `pkgVersion` parameter was removed from the `loadInterstitialFromLocal`, `loadInterstitialFromBAPI`, and `buildPublicInterstitialUrl` functions. Use `clerkJSVersion` instead. Example:

    ```diff
    - loadInterstitialFromLocal({ pkgVersion: "" })
    + loadInterstitialFromLocal({ clerkJSVersion: "" })
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    This change is only relevant to power users of Clerk building custom integrations for frameworks that run both on the client and server (e.g. Next.js, Astro, etc.). `createIsomorphicRequest` & `buildRequestUrl` were used to adapt and transform any framework-specific request-like objects to the native `Request` class that `@clerk/backend` uses. This was done through polyfilling `fetch`. Since v5 requires you to use Node 18.17.0 or later that polyfilling is not required anymore and you can use the native `fetch`.

    If your integration needs to transform its specific object to a `Request`, you can build something like the [Fastify integration](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/0cfd8cf3f1bef0a8f34b7a4d2d782dd8fc2a7090/packages/fastify/src/utils.ts) is doing.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    You could do a request like the following:

    ```ts
    import { createClerkClient } from "@clerk/backend"

    const clerkClient = createClerkClient({ secretKey: "" })

    const { data: user } = await clerkClient.users.getUser("")
    ```
    Previously, you could access `user.profileImageUrl` and now it's `user.imageUrl`. Various image related properties were all aligned to `imageUrl`. So if you use any of these, change the property:

    - `ExternalAccount.picture`
    - `Organization.logoUrl`
    - `User.profileImageUrl`
    - `OrganizationMembershipPublicUserData.profileImageUrl`

    Or if you using the raw responses change the following properties to `image_url` in the following types:

    - `ExternalAccountJSON.avatar_url`
    - `OrganizationJSON.logo_url`
    - `UserJSON.profile_image_url`
    - `OrganizationMembershipPublicUserDataJSON.profile_image_url`
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The `clerkClient.__unstable_options` property was removed. You could use it to update the internal options. Instead, create a new clerkClient instance using `createClerkClient`. For example:

    ```diff
      import { createClerkClient } from "@clerk/backend"

      const clerkClient = createClerkClient({ secretKey: "old" })

    - clerkClient.__unstable_options.secretKey = "new"
    + const newClerkClient = createClerkClient({ secretKey: "new" })
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

### `@clerk/clerk-js`

- The `getOrganizationMemberships()` method on the `Clerk` class has been removed. Use `getOrganizationMemberships()` on a `user` instance instead.

    ```diff
      const clerk = new Clerk()
    - clerk.getOrganizationMemberships()
    + clerk.user.getOrganizationMemberships()
    ```

    Also note that the response has changed from `Array<Organization>` to `{ total_count: number; data: Array<Organization> }`.

- `Organization.create()` has a new function signature.

    ```diff
    const clerk = new Clerk()

    - clerk.organization.create("example")
    + clerk.organization.crete({ name: "example" })
    ```

- Removed `Organization.getPendingInvitations()`, you need to use `Organization.getInvitations()` instead.

    ```diff
      const clerk = new Clerk()

    - clerk.organization.getPendingInvitations()
    + clerk.organization.getInvitations({ status: "pending" })
    ```

- In [`User.createExternalAccount()`](/docs/references/javascript/user/create-metadata#create-external-account) the `redirect_url` parameter was renamed to `redirectUrl`.
- In `Signup.attemptWeb3WalletVerification()` the parameters have changed. Use `signature` instead of `identifier`.

    ```diff
      const clerk = new Clerk()

    - clerk.client.signUp.attemptWeb3WalletVerification({ identifier: "" })
    + clerk.client.signUp.attemptWeb3WalletVerification({ signature: "" })
    ```

- The `Clerk.isReady()` method has been removed. You can use the `Clerk.loaded` property instead.

    ```diff
      const clerk = new Clerk()
    - clerk.isReady()
    + clerk.loaded
    ```

### `@clerk/nextjs`

`withClerkMiddleware` has been removed. Use [`clerkMiddleware`](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware) instead. Here's an example of having all routes public except for everything under `/dashboard`.

Before:

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import { withClerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server"
import { getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server"
import { NextResponse } from "next/server"
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server"

const publicPaths = ["/", "/sign-in*", "/sign-up*"]

const isPublic = (path: string) => {
  return publicPaths.find((x) =>
    path.match(new RegExp(`^${x}$`.replace("*$", "($|/)")))
  )
}

export default withClerkMiddleware((request: NextRequest) => {
  if (isPublic(request.nextUrl.pathname)) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }
  const { userId } = getAuth(request)

  if (!userId) { 
    const signInUrl = new URL("/sign-in", request.url)
    return NextResponse.redirect(signInUrl)
  }
  return NextResponse.next()
})

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
}
```

After:

```ts filename="middleware.ts"
import {
  clerkMiddleware,
  createRouteMatcher
} from "@clerk/nextjs/server"
import { NextResponse } from "next/server"

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(["/dashboard(.*)"])

export default clerkMiddleware((auth, request) => {
  if (isProtectedRoute(request)) {
    auth().protect()
  }

  return NextResponse.next()
})

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
}
```

### `@clerk/clerk-react`

- The `useOrganizations` hook was removed. Use [`useOrganizationList`](/docs/references/react/use-organization-list) instead. Please note that the latter has different function signatures.
- The `userProfile` prop on the [`UserButton`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/user-button) component has been changed to `userProfileProps`. This is purely a name change, none of the values need to be updated.
- The `afterSwitchOrganizationUrl` prop on the `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component has been renamed to `afterSelectOrganizationUrl`.

    ```diff
    - <OrganizationSwitcher afterSwitchOrganizationUrl="" />
    + <OrganizationSwitcher afterSelectOrganizationUrl="" />
    ```
- The `invitationList` and `membershipList` parameter for the [`useOrganization`](/docs/references/react/use-organization) hook was renamed to `invitations` and `memberships`. In v4 you'd pass in `limit` and `offset`, now you have to use `initialPage` and `pageSize`.

    Before:

    ```js
    const { invitationList, membershipList } = useOrganization({
      invitationList: { limit: 10, offset: 1 },
      membershipList: { limit: 10, offset: 1 },
    })
    ```

    After:

    ```js
    const { invitations, memberships } = useOrganization({
      invitations: { initialPage: 1, pageSize: 10 },
      memberships: { initialPage: 1, pageSize: 10 },
    })
    ```

    For more information, read the [`useOrganization`](/docs/references/react/use-organization) docs.

### Other packages

#### `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node`
