# Add React Router to your Clerk-powered React application

Learn how to add React Router to your application using React Router's new Data API router. This tutorial will cover configuring layouts and setting up protected routes.

<Steps>

### Install `react-router-dom`

React Router's `react-router-dom` is a mature, battle tested routing package for React that gives you many options. As it is the most popular routing option, it will be used for this guide.

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn" ]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install react-router-dom
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add react-router-dom
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add react-router-dom
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Create components for your routes

The exact routes you will need depends on your application. For this guide, you will create `/`, `/contact`, `/dashboard`, `/sign-in`, and `sign-up` routes. The `/dashboard` route will contain a default route (`/dashbard/`) and an invoices route (`/dashboard/invoices`). The first step will be creating basic components for these routes.

Use the tabs below to find the example components and recreate these files using the path from each tab.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["Index", "Contact", "Sign-in", "Sign-up", "Dashboard",  "Invoices"]}>

```tsx filename="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

export default function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>This is the index page</h1>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li><Link to="/sign-up">Sign Up</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/sign-in">Sign In</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/contact">Contact</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="src/routes/contact.tsx"
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

export default function ContactPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Contact</h1>
      <p>This is a public page meant to contain a contact form and other related contact details.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><Link to="/">Return to Index</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link></li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

```tsx filename="src/routes/sign-in.tsx"
import { SignIn } from "@clerk/clerk-react"

export default function SignInPage() {
  return <SignIn path="/sign-in" />;
}
```

```tsx filename="src/routes/sign-up.tsx"
import { SignUp } from "@clerk/clerk-react"

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return <SignUp path="/sign-up" />;
}
```

```tsx filename="src/routes/dashboard.tsx"
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Dashboard page</h1>
      <p>This is a protected page.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><Link to="/dashboard/invoices">Invoices</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/">Return to index</Link></li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

```tsx filename="src/routes/dashboard.invoices.tsx"
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

export default function InvoicesPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Invoices page</h1>
      <p>This is a protected page.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/">Return to index</Link></li>
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

</CodeBlockTabs>

### Create layouts

You're going to create two layouts for your application. One will mount [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) and act as a top level layout. It will also be a place for a header, footer, and other standard elements for your application.

The second layout will be non-rendering and will protect everything in the `/dashboard` route. This avoids the need for per-page auth checks or for using Clerk's control components.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["Root Layout", "Dashboard Layout"]}>

```tsx filename="src/layouts/root-layout.tsx"
import { Link, Outlet, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'
import { ClerkProvider, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Missing Publishable Key")
}

export default function RootLayout() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  return (
    <ClerkProvider navigate={navigate} publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
      <header className="header">
        <div>
          <div>
            <p>Clerk + React + React Router App</p>
          </div>
          <SignedIn>
            <UserButton afterSignOutUrl='/sign-in' />
          </SignedIn>
          <SignedOut>
            <Link to="/sign-in">Sign In</Link>
          </SignedOut>
        </div>
      </header>
      <main>
        <Outlet />
      </main>
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="src/layouts/dashboard-layout.tsx"
import * as React from 'react'
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/clerk-react"
import { Outlet, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom"

export default function DashboardLayout() {
    const { userId, isLoaded } = useAuth()
    const navigate = useNavigate()

    console.log('test', userId)

    React.useEffect(() => {
        if (isLoaded && !userId) {
            navigate("/sign-in")
        }
    }, [isLoaded])

    if (!isLoaded) return "Loading..."

    return (
        <Outlet />
    )
}
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

#### Key Takeaways

- The new root-layout.tsx has a simple header that includes the `<UserButton />` and a link to the `/sign-in` page instead of a `<SignInButton />`. The rendering of these is controlled by the `<SignedIn>` and `<SignedOut>` control components. This is very similar to the [Embed the `<UserButton />` and `<SignInButton />`](/docs/quickstarts/react#embed-the-user-button-and-sign-in-button) step from the [React Quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/react).
- Both the layouts contain an `<Outlet />` component from `react-router-dom`. This behaves similar to `{children}` in Next.js or more generic React components. You will take advantage of this component in the next step.

### Wire layouts and routes up with `createBrowserRouter`

With all the routes and layouts you need created, you now need to wire up the layouts and the routes with the `createBrowserRouter` function from `react-router-dom`. This will use the Data API (aka Data Router) to configure your application.

You can start by removing `src/App.tsx`â€”the contents of that file were moved to `src/layouts/root-layout.tsx`.

In `src/main.tsx`, import `RouterProvider` and `createBrowserRouter()` from `react-router-dom`, as well as all of the default components from the layouts and routes you created. Replace the contents inside of `<React.StrictMode />` with only ` <RouterProvider router={router} />`. Lastly, you will build the `router` using `createBrowserRouter()`.

```tsx filename="src/main.tsx"
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import { RouterProvider, createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

// Import the layouts
import RootLayout from './layouts/root-layout'
import DashboardLayout from './layouts/dashboard-layout'

// Import the components
import IndexPage from './routes'
import ContactPage from './routes/contact'
import SignInPage from './routes/sign-in'
import SignUpPage from './routes/sign-up'
import DashboardPage from './routes/dashboard'
import InvoicesPage from './routes/dashboard.invoices'

const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    element: <RootLayout />,
    children: [
      { path: "/", element: <IndexPage /> },
      { path: "/contact", element: <ContactPage /> },
      { path: "/sign-in/*", element: <SignInPage /> },
      { path: "/sign-up/*", element: <SignUpPage /> },
      {
        element: <DashboardLayout />,
        path: "dashboard",
        children: [
          { path: "/dashboard", element: <DashboardPage /> },
          { path: "/dashboard/invoices", element: <InvoicesPage /> }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
])

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

Visit [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) and explore your app's pages.

#### Key Takeaways

- The top most object in the `router` is the `<RootLayout />` component, and everything else is a child. Any child route will be mounted where the `<Outlet />` component is inside the root layout. This wraps the entire application with `<ClerkProvider>` and allows you to add a header, footer, sidebars and other pieces that will be available to the entire application.
- Several routes are direct children of the root layout. These are all public routes. You can use control components like `<SignedIn>` or check the `userId` from `useAuth()` if you want to make content protected.
- The `<DashboardLayout />` is child of the root layout, renders nothing, and has a check to see if the `userId` exists. This will confirm that a user is signed in. If the `userId` is not truthy, then the user will be redirected to the `/sign-in` route to sign-in. That protects all pages in the `/dashboard` route. All children of `/dashboard` will be mounted inside of the `<Outlet />` component in the dashboard layout.
