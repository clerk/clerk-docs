This tutorial outlines how to integrate Clerk's authentication with applications deployed through the Vercel Marketplace. Clerk provides seamless authentication for applications distributed via Vercel's integration marketplace, allowing users to add authentication to their projects with minimal configuration.

<Steps>
  ## Configure your Clerk application

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to your application settings.
  1. Under **Domains**, add your Vercel deployment domains (both preview and production).
  1. Configure your **Redirect URIs** to include your Vercel deployment URLs.
  1. Copy your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key** from the **API Keys** section.

  ## Set up environment variables

  1. In your Vercel project dashboard, navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**.
  1. Add the following environment variables:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Your Clerk publishable key
     - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`: Your Clerk secret key
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL`: `/sign-in` (or your custom sign-in URL)
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL`: `/sign-up` (or your custom sign-up URL)
  1. Ensure these variables are set for all environments (Development, Preview, Production).

  ## Deploy with Clerk integration

  1. Your application should now be configured to work with Clerk authentication.
  1. When users install your application from the Vercel Marketplace, they will inherit your Clerk configuration.
  1. Test your deployment to ensure authentication flows work correctly across all Vercel environments.

  ## Marketplace considerations

  When preparing your application for the Vercel Marketplace:

  - Ensure your Clerk configuration supports multiple domains
  - Document any required environment variables for end users
  - Consider providing setup instructions for users who want to use their own Clerk instance
  - Test the installation flow from the marketplace perspective
</Steps>
