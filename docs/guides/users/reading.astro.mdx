Clerk provides helpers that you can use to protect content and read user data in your Astro application.

## Server-side

The [`auth()`](/docs/reference/astro/locals) and [`currentUser()`](/docs/reference/astro/locals) locals are Astro-specific helpers that you can use inside of your Astro components and [endpoints](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes).

- The `auth()` local returns the [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object of the currently active user.
- The `currentUser()` local returns the [`Backend User`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-user) object of the currently active user. This is helpful if you want to render user information, like their first and last name, directly from the server. Under the hood, `currentUser()` uses the [`clerkClient`](/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart) wrapper to make a call to the Backend API. **This does count towards the [Backend API request rate limit](/docs/guides/how-clerk-works/system-limits)**. This also uses `fetch()` so it is automatically deduped per request.

The following example demonstrates how to protect a page from unauthenticated users and access the current user's information.

<CodeBlockTabs options={[".astro component", "API Route"]}>
  ```astro {{ filename: 'src/pages/me.astro' }}
  ---
  // Use `locals.auth()` to access `isAuthenticated` and the user's ID
  const { isAuthenticated, userId } = Astro.locals.auth()

  // Protect the route by checking if the user is signed in
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return Astro.redirect('/login')
  }

  // Get the Backend User object when you need access to the user's information
  const user = await Astro.locals.currentUser()
  ---

  <!-- Use `user` to render user details or create UI elements -->
  <div>Welcome, {user.firstName}!</div>
  ```

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/api/me.ts' }}
  export async function GET({ locals }) {
    // Use `locals.auth()` to access `isAuthenticated` and the user's ID
    const { isAuthenticated, userId } = locals.auth()

    // Protect the route by checking if the user is signed in
    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })
    }

    // Get the Backend User object when you need access to the user's information
    const user = await locals.currentUser()

    // Add your Route Handler's logic with the returned `user` object

    return new Response(
      JSON.stringify({ userId: user.id, email: user.emailAddresses[0].emailAddress }),
    )
  }
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Retrieve data from external sources

Clerk provides integrations with a number of popular databases.

To retrieve a token from a [JWT template](/docs/guides/sessions/jwt-templates) and fetch data from an external source, use the [`getToken()`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#get-token){{ target: '_blank' }} method from the `auth()` local.

```ts {{ filename: 'src/pages/api/route.ts' }}
export async function GET({ locals }) {
  // Use `locals.auth()` to access `isAuthenticated`, the user's ID, and the `getToken()` method
  const { isAuthenticated, userId, getToken } = locals.auth()

  // Protect the route by checking if the user is signed in
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })
  }

  // Use `getToken()` to get a token from the JWT template
  const token = await getToken({ template: 'supabase' })

  // Fetch data from Supabase and return it
  const data = { supabaseData: 'Hello World' }

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(data))
}
```

## Client-side

Clerk Astro provides a set of useful [stores](/docs/reference/astro/overview#client-side-helpers) that give you access to many important objects, such as the `Clerk`, `User`, and `Session` object.
