title: Common Clerk + Next.js Errors
---

This page lists common errors you may encounter when using Clerk with Next.js, along with explanations and solutions.

## 1. `auth() was called, but no authProvider was found`
See [auth-was-called.mdx](./auth-was-called.mdx) for details.

## 2. `Missing Clerk Frontend API`
**Error:**
```
Clerk: Missing Clerk Frontend API. Please set NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY in your environment.
```
**Solution:**
- Ensure you have set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` environment variable in your `.env.local` or deployment environment.
- Restart your dev server after adding or changing env vars.

## 3. `Missing Clerk Secret Key`
**Error:**
```
Clerk: Missing Clerk Secret Key. Please set CLERK_SECRET_KEY in your environment.
```
**Solution:**
- Set the `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in your environment (never expose this to the client!).
- For Vercel, add it in the project settings under Environment Variables.

## 4. `401 Unauthorized` on API routes
**Possible causes:**
- The session token is missing or invalid.
- The API route is not wrapped with Clerk middleware.
- The frontend and backend are not sharing cookies (check domain and path settings).

**Solution:**
- Ensure you are using Clerk's middleware in your API routes.
- Check that cookies are being sent with requests (especially for cross-origin requests).
- Verify the session token using Clerk helpers.

## 5. `SSR/CSR Mismatch` or "Hydration failed"
**Possible causes:**
- Using Clerk hooks/components outside of ClerkProvider.
- Rendering Clerk components on the server when they require the client.

**Solution:**
- Always wrap your app in `<ClerkProvider>`.
- Use Clerk's SSR helpers for server-side rendering.
- Check the [SSR guide](../rendering-modes.mdx).

## 6. `CORS` errors
**Possible causes:**
- API routes are not configured to accept requests from your frontend domain.
- Cookies are not being sent due to missing credentials config.

**Solution:**
- Set up CORS headers correctly in your API routes.
- Use `credentials: 'include'` in your fetch/AJAX requests if needed.
