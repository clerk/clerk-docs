# ClerkJS

ClerkJS is our foundational JavaScript library for building user management and authentication. It enables you to register, sign in, verify and manage users for your application using highly customizable flows.

While we typically recommend using one of our framework SDK's, such as [Clerk React](/docs/quickstarts/react) or [Clerk Next.js](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs), having the ability to use the underlying ClerkJS package provides more freedom to use Clerk how you best see fit.

## Installation

Please follow the instructions in the [ClerkJS quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/javascript) to add ClerkJS to your project.

## Usage

Once you have ClerkJS integrated into your project and have access to the [`Clerk` class](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk), you're able to access and call a myriad of attributes and methods to control your user management and authentication.

To utilize these methods and attributes, Clerk has a wide array of classes you will access, such as:

- [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk)
- [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user)
- [`Organization`](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization)
