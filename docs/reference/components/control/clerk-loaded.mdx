The `<ClerkLoaded>` component guarantees that the Clerk object has loaded (the `status` is `'ready'` or `'degraded'`) and will be available under `window.Clerk`. This allows you to wrap child components to access the `Clerk` object without the need to check it exists.

  ## Example

  It's not recommended to wrap the entire app in the `<ClerkLoaded>` component; instead, only wrap the components that need access to the `Clerk` object.

  <Include src="_partials/control-components-with-clerkdegraded" />

  <If sdk="astro">
    > [!NOTE]
    > Unlike other Clerk components for Astro, `<ClerkLoaded>` must be imported from `@clerk/astro/react`. This requires that your Astro app is set up with React. See [Use Clerk with Astro and React](/docs/reference/astro/react) for guidance.

  ## Usage with JavaScript

  The following methods available on an instance of the [`Clerk`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk) class is used to render and control the `<ClerkLoaded />` component:

  - [`load()`](#load)

  The following examples assume that you have followed the [quickstart](/docs/js-frontend/getting-started/quickstart) in order to add Clerk to your JavaScript application.

  ### `load()`

  Render the `<ClerkLoaded>` component to an HTML `<div>` element.

  ```typescript
  function load(options?: ClerkOptions): Promise<void>
  ```

  #### `ClerkOptions`

  <Include src="_partials/javascript/clerk-options" />

  #### `load()` usage

  ```js {{ filename: 'main.js', mark: [7] }}
  import { Clerk } from '@clerk/clerk-js'

  // Initialize Clerk with your Clerk Publishable Key
  const clerkPubKey = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  const clerk = new Clerk(clerkPubKey)
  await clerk.load()
  ```
</If>
