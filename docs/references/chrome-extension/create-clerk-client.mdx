title: '`createClerkClient()`'
description: "`createClerkClient()` allows Chrome Extension developers to access a user's session information or get a token in a service worker."
---

The `createClerkClient()` helper initializes a new Clerk instance on demand and refreshes the session token if there is a valid, signed-in user. It can be used in a [background service worker](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/service-workers/basics) to access a user's information or session token.

When a side panel or a popup is closed, the Clerk process that normally refreshes the user's session token every 60 seconds is no longer running, and the stored session will become stale. If a request were made 60 seconds after the side panel or popup was closed, it would fail because the session token is no longer valid. By configuring `createClerkClient()` to run in a background service worker, you can ensure that the user's session is always fresh.

## Usage

The following example:

- Creates a background service worker that sets up an event listener to handle requests from a [content script](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/content-scripts). If the request wants to interact with Clerk, the listener calls `createClerkClient()` to create a Clerk instance and refresh the session token, and then calls [`getToken()`](/docs/references/javascript/session#get-token) to get the token.
- Adds a link to the home page of the extension that when visited, opens the page as a new tab.
- The new tab has a button on it that, when clicked, triggers the background service worker.

> [!WARNING]
> The following example assumes that you have followed the [Chrome Extension Quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/chrome-extension) and then the [Add React Router](/docs/references/chrome-extension/add-react-router) guide, but you can apply these concepts to your own application.

<Steps>
  ### Create your background service worker

  1. In the `src/` directory, create the `background/` directory.
  1. In the `background/` directory, create the `index.ts` file.
  1. In the `index.ts` file, paste the following code to create an event listener that listens for messages from content scripts and calls a function that uses `createClerkClient()` to get a new token for the user.

  ```typescript {{ filename: 'src/background/index.ts' }}
  import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/chrome-extension/background'

  const publishableKey = process.env.PLASMO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  if (!publishableKey) {
    throw new Error('Please add the PLASMO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY to the .env.development file')
  }

  // Use `createClerkClient()` to create a new Clerk instance
  // and use `getToken()` to get a fresh token for the user
  async function getToken() {
    const clerk = await createClerkClient({
      publishableKey,
    })

    // If there is no valid session, then return null. Otherwise proceed.
    if (!clerk.session) {
      return null
    }

    // Return the user's session
    return await clerk.session?.getToken()
  }

  // Create a listener to listen for messages from content scripts
  // It must return true, in order to keep the connection open and send a response later.
  // NOTE: A runtime listener cannot be async.
  chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {
    // This example sends the token back to the content script
    // but you could also use the token to perform actions on behalf of the user
    getToken()
      .then((token) => sendResponse({ token }))
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error('[Background service worker] Error:', JSON.stringify(error))
        // If there is no token then send a null response
        sendResponse({ token: null })
      })
    return true // REQUIRED: Indicates that the listener responds asynchronously.
  })
  ```

  ### Create the tab with the content script

  1. In the `src/` directory, create the `tabs/` directory.
  1. In the `tabs/` directory, create the `background-worker-demo.html` file.
  1. In the `background-worker-demo.html` file, paste the following code to create a basic HTML file that will house the React component for the content script.
     ```html {{ filename: 'src/tabs/background-worker-demo.html' }}
     <!doctype html>
     <html>
       <head>
         <title>Clerk Background Worker Demo</title>
         <meta charset="utf-8" />
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
       </head>

       <body></body>
     </html>
     ```
  1. In the `tabs/` directory, create the `background-worker-demo.tsx` file.
  1. In the `background-worker-demo.tsx` file, paste the following code to create a React component with a button that will trigger the background service worker to get the token. If the token is returned, it will be displayed on the page.
     ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/tabs/background-worker-demo.tsx' }}
     import * as React from 'react'

     export default function NewTab() {
       const [token, setToken] = React.useState<string | null>(null)

       const getToken = async (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => {
         e.preventDefault()

         // Trigger the background service worker to get the token
         // and set the token in the state
         chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ greeting: 'get-token' }, (response) => {
           setToken(response.token)
         })
       }

       return (
         <div>
           <p>Clerk Background Worker Demo</p>
           <div className="App">
             <p>
               This new tab simulates a content page where you might want to access user information, or
               make a request to your backend server and include a user token in the request.
             </p>
             <p>Make sure that you are signed into the extension. You can have the popup closed.</p>
             <button type="button" onClick={getToken} className="button invert">
               Get token from service worker
             </button>
             {token && <p>Token: {token}</p>}
           </div>
         </div>
       )
     }
     ```

  ### Add a button to the extension to open the new tab

  Add a button to your Chrome Extension to open the page you created in the previous step as a new tab. This can be added anywhere in your extension. The following example places the button on the home page of the extension.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/popup/routes/home.tsx' }}
  export const Home = () => {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Clerk + Chrome Extension</h1>
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            chrome.tabs.create({
              url: './tabs/background-worker-demo.html',
            })
          }}
        >
          Open background worker demo in a new tab
        </button>
      </>
    )
  }
  ```

  ### Test the background service worker

  1. Run your project with the following command:
     ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
     pnpm dev
     ```
  1. In your Chrome browser, open the extension popup and sign in.
  1. Once you've signed in, select the button that you added and a new tab will open.
  1. In the new tab, select the **Get token from service worker** button. The token will be displayed on the page.

<Properties>
  - `publishableKey`
  - `string`

  The Clerk Publishable Key for your instance. This can be found on the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

  - `syncHost?`
  - `string`

  The host to sync the session with. For more information, see [the dedicated guide](/docs/references/chrome-extension/sync-host).
