description: Learn how to manage your users in your Clerk application.

To get started, it's important to first understand Clerk's [`User` object](/docs/reference/javascript/user).

<Include src="_partials/user-object" />

For more information on the `User` object, such as helper methods for retrieving and updating user information and authentication status, see the [reference docs](/docs/reference/javascript/user). The `User` object is also available in the backend, but it looks slightly different. For more information, see the [Backend `User` object reference docs](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-user).

## Manage users

You can manage your users [in the Clerk Dashboard](#in-the-clerk-dashboard), or [programmatically](#programmatically).

### In the Clerk Dashboard

To manage users in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Users**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/users) page.

### Programmatically

You can manage users programmatically through the [frontend](#in-the-frontend) or [backend](#in-the-backend).

#### In the frontend

Depending on the level of abstraction you need, you can manage users in the frontend using Clerk's prebuilt components, React hooks, or lower-level JavaScript methods.

- Prebuilt components: Clerk provides the prebuilt components [`<UserButton />`](/docs/reference/components/user/user-button) and [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/reference/components/user/user-profile) to help your users manage their profile data.
- Hooks: Because Clerk's React-based SDKs are built on top of the Clerk React SDK, you can use the [hooks](/docs/reference/react/overview#custom-hooks) that the React SDK provides. These hooks include access to the `User` object and helpful methods for managing user authentication and profile data.
- JavaScript methods: If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview).

#### In the backend

The [JS Backend SDK](/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart) is a wrapper around the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} that makes it easier to interact with the API. It includes many methods for managing users, such as `getUser()`, `createUser()`, and `deleteUser()`. For more information, see the [JS Backend SDK reference docs](/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart).

## Create users

You can create users either [in the Clerk Dashboard](#in-the-clerk-dashboard-2) or [programmatically](#programmatically-2).

### In the Clerk Dashboard

To create a user in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Users**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/users) page and select **Create user**.

### Programmatically

To create a user programmatically, you can either [make a request directly to Clerk's Backend API](/docs/reference/backend/user/create-user#backend-api-bapi-endpoint) or use the [`createUser()`](/docs/reference/backend/user/create-user) method as shown in the following example.

<Include src="_partials/create-user" />

## Delete users

You can delete users either [in the Clerk Dashboard](#in-the-clerk-dashboard-3) or [programmatically](#programmatically-3).

### In the Clerk Dashboard

To delete a user in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Users**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/users) page. You can either select the user and then in the side navigation menu, select **Delete user**, or select the menu icon on the right side of the user's row and select **Delete user**.

### Programmatically

To delete a user programmatically, you can either [make a request directly to Clerk's Backend API](/docs/reference/backend/user/delete-user#backend-api-bapi-endpoint) or use the [`deleteUser()`](/docs/reference/backend/user/delete-user) method as shown in the following example.

<Include src="_partials/delete-user" />
