description: Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Nuxt application using the Clerk Nuxt SDK.
---

The Nuxt SDK is built on top of the [Vue SDK](/docs/references/vue/overview), and is the recommended method for integrating Clerk into your Nuxt application.

## Guides

- [Read session and user data](/docs/references/nuxt/read-session-data)
- [Protecting pages](/docs/references/nuxt/protecting-pages)

## Client-side helpers

The Nuxt SDK provides composables that give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object and helper methods for authentication flows. See the [Vue SDK reference](/docs/references/vue/overview) for details.

- [`useUser()`](/docs/references/vue/use-user)
- [`useClerk()`](/docs/references/vue/use-clerk)
- [`useAuth()`](/docs/references/vue/use-auth)
- [`useSignIn()`](/docs/references/vue/use-sign-in)
- [`useSignUp()`](/docs/references/vue/use-sign-up)
- [`useSession()`](/docs/references/vue/use-session)
- [`useSessionList()`](/docs/references/vue/use-session-list)
- [`useOrganization()`](/docs/references/vue/use-organization)

## Server-side helpers

The following references show how to integrate Clerk features into applications using Nuxt server functions and API routes.

### `Auth` object

The `Auth` object is available at `event.context.auth` in your [event handlers](https://h3.unjs.io/guide/event-handler). This JavaScript object contains important information like session data, your user's ID, as well as their organization ID. Learn more about the `Auth` object [here](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object).

### `clerkMiddleware()`

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication and authorization into your Nuxt application through middleware. You can learn more [here](/docs/references/nuxt/clerk-middleware).
