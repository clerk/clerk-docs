</If>

The `AuthView` renders a comprehensive authentication interface with support for multiple sign-up flows and sign-in methods, multi-factor authentication, password reset, and account recovery. The functionality of the `AuthView` is controlled by the instance settings you specify in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), such as [sign-in and sign-up options](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options) and [social connections](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/all-providers).

By default, the `AuthView` will automatically determine whether to sign users in or sign them up based on whether they already have an account. This is the default mode that provides seamless authentication without requiring users to choose between sign-in and sign-up.

## Parameters

<If sdk="ios">
  <Properties>
    - `mode`
    - `AuthView.Mode`

    The authentication mode that determines which flows are available to the user. Accepts the following values:

    - `.signInOrUp`: Automatically determines whether to sign users in or sign them up based on whether they already have an account. This is the default mode that provides seamless authentication without requiring users to choose between sign-in and sign-up.
    - `.signIn`: Restricts the interface to sign-in flows only. Users can only authenticate with existing accounts.
    - `.signUp`: Restricts the interface to sign-up flows only. Users can only create new accounts.

    Defaults to `.signInOrUp`.

    ---

    - `isDismissable`
    - `Bool`

    Whether the view can be dismissed by the user. When `true`, a dismiss button appears and the view closes automatically after successful authentication. When `false`, no dismiss button is shown. Defaults to `true`.
  </Properties>
</If>

<If sdk="android">
  <Properties>
    - `modifier`

    - `Modifier`

    A modifier that gets applied to the `AuthView` composable. This is by default applied to the top level `NavDisplay` and shouldn't be used to change the appearance of the `AuthView` itself.
  </Properties>
</If>

## Usage

<If sdk="ios">
  The following examples show how to use the `AuthView` in your iOS app.

  ### Basic usage as a dismissable sheet

  ```swift
  struct HomeView: View {
    @Environment(\.clerk) private var clerk
    @State private var authIsPresented = false

    var body: some View {
      ZStack {
        if clerk.user != nil {
          UserButton()
            .frame(width: 36, height: 36)
        } else {
          Button("Sign in") {
            authIsPresented = true
          }
        }
      }
      .sheet(isPresented: $authIsPresented) {
        AuthView()
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Fullscreen authentication (non-dismissable)

  ```swift
  struct ProfileView: View {
    @Environment(\.clerk) private var clerk

    var body: some View {
      if clerk.user != nil {
        UserProfileView(isDismissable: false)
      } else {
        AuthView(isDismissable: false)
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</If>

<If sdk="android">
  The following example shows how to use the `AuthView` in your Android app.

  ### Basic usage

  ```kotlin
  import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Box
  import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.fillMaxSize
  import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
  import androidx.compose.runtime.getValue
  import androidx.compose.ui.Alignment
  import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier
  import androidx.lifecycle.compose.collectAsStateWithLifecycle
  import com.clerk.api.Clerk
  import com.clerk.ui.auth.AuthView
  import com.clerk.ui.userbutton.UserButton

  @Composable
  fun HomeScreen() {
      val user by Clerk.userFlow.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
      Box(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(), contentAlignment = Alignment.Center) {
          if (user != null) {
              UserButton()
          } else {
              AuthView()
          }
      }
