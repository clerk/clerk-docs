# `SignIn`

The `SignIn` object holds all the state of the current sign in and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign in process.

There are two important steps in the sign in flow.

1. Users *must* complete a first factor verification. This can be something like providing a password, an email magic link, a one-time code (OTP), a web3 wallet public address or providing proof of their identity through an external social account (SSO/OAuth).
2. After that, users *might need to* go through a second verification process. This is the second factor (2FA).

The `SignIn` object's properties can be split into logical groups, with each group providing information on different aspects of the sign in flow. These groups can be:

- Information about the current sign in status in general and which authentication identifiers, authentication methods and verifications are supported.
- Information about the user and the provided authentication identifier value (email address, phone number or username).Information about each verification, either the first factor (logging in) or the second factor (2FA).

## Methods

### `create()`

```typescript
function create(params: SignInCreateParams): Promise<SignInResource>;
```

Use this method to kick-off the sign in flow. It creates a **SignIn** object and stores the sign in lifecycle state.

Depending on the use-case and the `params` you pass to the `create` method, it can either complete the sign in process in one go, or simply collect part of the necessary data for completing authentication at a later stage.

**Parameters**

| Name   | Description                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| params | *SignInCreateParams* Depending on the keys and values passed here, the create method's behavior changes. |

**Returns**

| Type                    | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| {"Promise<SignInResource>"} | This method returns a `Promise` which resolves with a `SignIn` object. Check the `status` attribute to see if the `SignIn` has been completed or a hint on what needs to happen next. |

### `resetPassword()`

```typescript
function resetPassword(params: ResetPasswordParams): Promise<SignInResource>;
```

#### `ResetPasswordParams`


<Tables
  headings={["Name", "Type", "Description"]}
  headingsMeta={[{}, {}, {maxWidth: "300px"}]}
  rows={[
    {cells: [<code>password</code>, <code>string</code>, <>The user's current password.</>]},
    {cells: [<code>signOutOfOtherSessions</code>, <code>boolean | undefined</code>, <>If <strong><code>true</code></strong>, log the user out of all other authenticated sessions.</>]},
  ]}
/>


### `createMagicLinkFlow()`

```typescript
function createMagicLinkFlow(): CreateMagicLinkFlowParams<SignInStartMagicLinkFlowParams, SignInResource>;
```

Sets up a sign in with magic link flow. Calling `createMagicLinkFlow()` will return two functions. The first function is async and starts the magic link flow, preparing a magic link verification. It sends the magic link email and starts polling for verification results. The signature is `startMagicLinkFlow({ redirectUrl: string, emailAddressId: string }) => Promise<SignInResource>`.

The second function can be used to stop polling at any time, allowing for full control of the flow and cleanup. The signature is `cancelMagicLinkFlow() => void`.

**Returns**

| Type                                                         | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| {"CreateMagicLinkFlowReturn<SignInStartMagicLinkFlowParams, SignInResource>"} | This method returns two functions. One to start the magic link flow and the other to cancel waiting for the results. |
