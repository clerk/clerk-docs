</TutorialHero>

<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/nextjs`

  Clerk's [Next.js SDK](/docs/references/nextjs/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, React hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Add the SDK to your project by running the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/nextjs
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/nextjs
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/nextjs
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your Clerk API keys

  <If condition={experiment.enabled}>
    <ExperimentCreateAccountFromDocsQuickstart params={experiment} />
  </If>

  <If condition={!experiment.enabled}>
    <SignedIn>
      Add the following keys to your `.env.local` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.
    </SignedIn>

    <SignedOut>
      1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys){{ track: 'exp_create_account_nextjs_quickstart' }} page.
      1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
      1. Paste your keys into your `.env.local` file.

      The final result should resemble the following:
    </SignedOut>
  </If>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env.local' }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ### Add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app

  [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#clerk-middleware) grants you access to user authentication state throughout your app, on any route or page. It also allows you to protect specific routes from unauthenticated users. To add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app, follow these steps:

  1. Create a `middleware.ts` file.
     - If you're using the `/src` directory, create `middleware.ts` in the `/src` directory.
     - If you're not using the `/src` directory, create `middleware.ts` in the root directory alongside `.env.local`.
  1. In your `middleware.ts` file, export Clerk's `clerkMiddleware()` helper:

     ```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
     import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

     export default clerkMiddleware()

     export const config = {
       matcher: [
         // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
         '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
         // Always run for API routes
         '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
       ],
     }
     ```
  1. By default, `clerkMiddleware()` will not protect any routes. All routes are public and you must opt-in to protection for routes. See the [`clerkMiddleware()` reference](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware) to learn how to require authentication for specific routes.

  ### Add `<ClerkProvider>` and Clerk components to your app

  The [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component wraps your app to provide active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components.

  You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/components/overview#what-are-control-components). Create a header using the following components:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button): Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page. In this example, since no props or [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables) are set for the sign-in URL, this component links to the [Account Portal sign-in page.](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview#sign-in)

  Select your preferred router to learn how to make this data available across your entire app:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx', mark: [6, [9, 16], 20] }}
    import { ClerkProvider, SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from '@clerk/nextjs'
    import './globals.css'

    export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider>
          <html lang="en">
            <body>
              <header>
                <SignedOut>
                  <SignInButton />
                </SignedOut>
                <SignedIn>
                  <UserButton />
                </SignedIn>
              </header>
              <main>{children}</main>
            </body>
          </html>
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    }
    ```

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'pages/_app.tsx', mark: [[7, 15]] }}
    import '@/styles/globals.css'
    import { ClerkProvider, SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from '@clerk/nextjs'
    import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

    function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
          <SignedOut>
            <SignInButton />
          </SignedOut>
          <SignedIn>
            <UserButton />
          </SignedIn>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    }

    export default MyApp
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Create your first user

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your app's homepage at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Sign up to create your first user.
