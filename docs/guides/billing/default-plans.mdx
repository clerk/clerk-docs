<Include src="_partials/billing/billing-experimental" />

When Billing is enabled, Clerk automatically assigns the free plan to every new user or organization as the **default plan**. This ensures every customer always has an active Subscription.

Users are moved to the free plan when they:

- Downgrade from a paid Subscription
- Stop paying for a paid Subscription
- Cancel a paid Subscription

## Can I update it?

You can update the name, slug, and public visibility.

Changing public visibility doesn't change the free Subscription functionality; it just hides it from the pricing table.

## Is it possible to change the default plan?

Not yet, but additional features are planned to support paid-customers-only use cases.
