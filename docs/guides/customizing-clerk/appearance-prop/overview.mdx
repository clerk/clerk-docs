Customizing the appearance of Clerk components is a powerful way to make your application look and feel unique. Clerk provides a way to customize the appearance of its components using the `appearance` prop.

The `appearance` prop can be used to share styles across every component, or applied individually to any of the Clerk components. When using it for global styling, the prop is available wherever you initialize the Clerk integration. For most SDKs, this means applying it to the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/reference/components/clerk-provider) component, while in others, it's configured through the SDK's Clerk integration or plugin.

This applies to all of the React-based packages, like [Next.js](/docs/nextjs/getting-started/quickstart), as well as [the pure JavaScript ClerkJS package](/docs/reference/javascript/overview).

## Properties

The `appearance` prop accepts the following properties:

<Properties>
  - `theme?`
  - `BaseTheme | BaseTheme[]`

  A theme used as the base theme for the components. For more information, see [Themes](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/themes).

  ---

  - `layout?`
  - `Layout`

  Configuration options that affect the layout of the components, allowing customizations that are hard to implement with just CSS. For more information, see [Layout](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/layout).

  ---

  - `variables?`
  - `Variables`

  General theme overrides. This styles will be merged with our base theme. Can override global styles like colors, fonts, etc. For more information, see [Variables](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/variables).

  ---

  - `elements?`
  - `Elements`

  ---

  - `cssLayerName?`
  - `string`

  The name of the CSS layer for Clerk component styles. This is useful for advanced CSS customization, allowing you to control the cascade and prevent style conflicts by isolating Clerk's styles within a specific layer. For more information on CSS layers, see the [MDN documentation on @layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer).

See the [Layout](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/layout) docs for more information.

## Customize the base theme

The `variables` property is used to adjust the general styles of a component's base theme, like colors, backgrounds, and typography. See the [Variables](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/variables) docs for more information.
