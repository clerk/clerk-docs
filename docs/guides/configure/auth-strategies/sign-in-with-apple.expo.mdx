This guide will teach you how to add native [Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/) to your Clerk Expo application.

> [!NOTE]
> Apple Sign-In works on both iOS Simulators and physical devices. However, physical devices provide full functionality including biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID), while simulators have limited support. Always test on a physical device before releasing to production.

<Steps>
  ## Add your Native Application

  Add your iOS application to the [**Native Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/native-applications) page in the Clerk Dashboard. You will need your iOS app's **App ID Prefix** (Team ID) and **Bundle ID**.

  ## Enable Apple as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Apple**.
  1. Ensure that **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** is toggled on.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Apple provides a privacy feature called [Hide My Email](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425#hideemail), allowing users to sign in to your app with Apple without disclosing their actual email addresses. Instead, your instance receives an app-specific email address that forwards any emails to the user's real address. To be able to send emails properly to users with hidden addresses, you must configure an additional setting in the Apple Developer portal. See [Configure Email Source for Apple Private Relay](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/apple#configure-email-source-for-apple-private-relay){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.

  ## Install dependencies

  The [Expo Apple Authentication library](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/apple-authentication/) provides access to Apple's native Sign in with Apple functionality from your Expo app.

  Run the following command to install the library:

  ```npm {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  npx expo install expo-apple-authentication
  ```

  ## Add `expo-apple-authentication` to your app config

  Add the `expo-apple-authentication` plugin to your `app.json` or `app.config.js`.

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["app.json", "app.config.js"]}>
    ```json {{ filename: 'app.json' }}
    {
      "expo": {
        "plugins": ["expo-apple-authentication"]
      }
    }
    ```

    ```js {{ filename: 'app.config.js' }}
    export default {
      expo: {
        plugins: ['expo-apple-authentication'],
      },
    }
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ## Build your authentication flow

  <Include src="_partials/expo/use-sign-in-with-apple-example" />

  ## Create a native build

  Create a native build with EAS Build or a local prebuild, since Apple Authentication is not supported in Expo Go.

  ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  # Using EAS Build
  eas build --platform ios

  # Or using local prebuild
  npx expo prebuild && npx expo run:ios --device
  ```
</Steps>
