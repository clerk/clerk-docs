# Use Clerk with Next.js

Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Next.js application. Clerk works seamlessly in both client side and server side components.

<Steps>

### Install `@clerk/nextjs`

Once you have a Next.js application ready, you need to install Clerk's Next.js SDK. This gives you access to prebuilt components and hooks, as well as [helpers](/docs/references/nextjs/overview) for Next.js API routes, server-side rendering, and Middleware.

<CodeBlockTabs options={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/nextjs
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add @clerk/nextjs
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @clerk/nextjs
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment keys

Below is an example of an `.env.local` file. If you are signed into your Clerk Dashboard, your keys should become visible by clicking on the eye icon.

<InjectKeys>

```sh filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
```

</InjectKeys>

### Mount `<ClerkProvider />`

Add the [`<ClerkProvider />`][clerk-provider] wrapper to your application. The [`<ClerkProvider />`][clerk-provider] component wraps your Next.js application to provide active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components. A reasonable default approach is to have [`<ClerkProvider />`][clerk-provider] wrap the `<body/>` to enable the context to be accessible anywhere within the app.


<Callout type="info">
  The [`<ClerkProvider />`][clerk-provider] component needs to access [headers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) to authenticate correctly. This means anything wrapped by the provider will be opted into [dynamic rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#dynamic-rendering) at request time. If you have static-optimized or ISR pages that you would prefer not to be opted into dynamic rendering, make sure they are <em>not</em> wrapped by [`<ClerkProvider />`][clerk-provider].
  
  This is easiest to accomplish by ensuring that [`<ClerkProvider />`][clerk-provider] is added further down the tree to wrap route groups that explicitly need authentication instead of having the provider wrap your application root as recommended above. For example, if your project includes a set of landing/marketing pages as well as a dashboard that requires login, you would create separate `(marketing)` and `(dashboard)` route groups. Adding [`<ClerkProvider />`][clerk-provider] to the `(dashboard)/layout.jsx` layout file will ensure that only those routes are opted into dynamic rendering, allowing the marketing routes to be statically optimized.

</Callout>

<CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
```tsx filename="app/layout.tsx"
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export const metadata = {
  title: 'Next.js 13 with Clerk',
}

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      <html lang="en">
        <body>{children}</body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="_app.tsx"
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
export default MyApp;
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

<Callout type="warning">
  The root layout is a server component. If you plan to use the [`<ClerkProvider />`][clerk-provider] outside the root layout, it will need to be a server component as well.
</Callout>

### Protect your application

Now that Clerk is installed and mounted in your application, it’s time to decide which pages are public and which need to hide behind authentication. We do this by creating a `middleware.ts` file at the root folder (or inside `src/` if that is how you set up your app).

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

// This example protects all routes including api/trpc routes
// Please edit this to allow other routes to be public as needed.
// See https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware for more information about configuring your Middleware
export default authMiddleware({});

export const config = {
      matcher: ['/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],
};

```

With this Middleware, your entire application is protected. If you try to access it, the Middleware will redirect you to your Sign Up page. If you want to make other routes public, check out the [authMiddleware reference page](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware).

### Build your own sign-in and sign-up pages

At this point, your application is fully protected by Clerk and uses Clerk's [Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview) pages that are available out of the box. You can start your Next.js application via `npm run dev`, visit `http://localhost:3000`, and sign up to get access to your application. 

Clerk also offers a set of [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) and [custom flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview) that you can use instead to embed sign in, sign up, and other user management functions into your Next.js application. We are going to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) and [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) components by utilizing the Next.js optional catch-all route.

#### Build your sign-up page

<CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
  ```tsx filename="app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx"
  import { SignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs";

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignUp />;
  }
  ```

  ```tsx filename="/pages/sign-up/[[...index]].tsx"
  import { SignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs";

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignUp />;
  }
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

#### Build your sign-in page

<CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
  ```tsx filename="app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx"
  import { SignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignIn />;
  }
  ```

  ```tsx filename="/pages/sign-in/[[...index]].tsx"
  import { SignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignIn />;
  }
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  By default, the Clerk components inherit the font family. `create-next-app` does not apply a global font family. When you launch your application, you may notice that the font family is different.
</Callout>

#### Update your environment variables

Next, add environment variables for the `signIn`, `signUp`, `afterSignUp`, and `afterSignIn` paths:

```sh filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
```

These values control the behavior of the components when you sign in or sign up and when you click on the respective links at the bottom of each component.

### Embed the `<UserButton />`

The [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button) allows users to manage their account information and log out, thus allowing you to complete a full authentication circle.

You can add it anywhere you want, but next to the logo in your main application page is a good start.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import { UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/"/>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="pages/example.tsx"
import { UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Example() {
  return (
    <>
			<header>
				<UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/"/>
			</header>
			<div>Your page's content can go here.</div>
    </>
  );
}
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Sign up for your application

Now start your Next.js application via `npm run dev`, visit `http://localhost:3000`, and sign up to get access to your application.

</Steps>

## Read session and user data

Clerk provides a set of [hooks and helpers](/docs/references/nextjs/overview#client-side-helpers) that you can use to access the active session and user data in your Next.js application. Here are examples of how to use these helpers in both the client and server side to get you started.

### Client side

#### `useAuth`

The [`useAuth`](/docs/references/react/use-auth) hook is a convenient way to access the current auth state. This hook provides the minimal information needed for data-loading and helper methods to manage the current active session.

```tsx filename="example.tsx"
"use client";
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Example() {
  const { isLoaded, userId, sessionId, getToken } = useAuth();

  // In case the user signs out while on the page.
  if (!isLoaded || !userId) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      Hello, {userId} your current active session is {sessionId}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### `useUser`

The [`useUser`](/docs/references/react/use-user) hook is a convenient way to access the current user data where you need it. This hook provides the user data and helper methods to manage the current active session.

```tsx filename="example.tsx"
"use client";
import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Example() {
  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser();

  if (!isLoaded || !isSignedIn) {
    return null;
  }

  return <div>Hello, {user.firstName} welcome to Clerk</div>;
}
```

### Server side

#### App Router

[`auth()`][auth-ref] and [`currentUser()`][currentuser-ref] are App Router-specific helpers that you can use inside of your Route Handlers, Middleware, Server Components, and Server Actions.


The [`auth()`][auth-ref] helper will return the [`Authentication`](/docs/references/nextjs/authentication-object) object of the currently active user. Now that request data is available in the global scope through Next.js's `headers()` and `cookies()` methods, passing the request object to Clerk is no longer required.

The [`currentUser()`][currentuser-ref] helper will return the [`User`][user-object] object of the currently active user. This is helpful if you want to render information, like their first and last name, directly from the server.

<Callout type="info">
  Any requests from a Client Component to a Route Handler will automatically include the user's current token as the Bearer token.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={["Server components and actions", "Route Handler", "Route Handler w/ User Fetch"]}>
  <Tab>
      Clerk has introduced new [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) and [`currentUser()`](/docs/references/nextjs/current-user) helpers for use in server components and server actions. The `auth()` helper returns the [`Authentication` Object](/docs/references/nextjs/authentication-object) status of the user. The `currentUser()` helper loads the [`User`][user-object] object for the authenticated user. This is helpful if you want to render information, like their first and last name, directly from the server.

    Under the hood, `currentUser()` uses the `clerkClient` wrapper to make a call to Clerk's Backend API. This does count towards the [Backend API Request Rate Limit](/docs/backend-requests/resources/rate-limits#rate-limits). This also uses `fetch()` so it is automatically deduped per request.

    ```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
    import { auth, currentUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export default async function Page() {

      // Get the userId from auth() -- if null the user is not logged in
      const { userId } = auth();

      // Get the User object when you need access to the user's information
      const user = await currentUser()
      // ...
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    A Route Handler added to [`publicRoutes`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#making-pages-public-using-public-routes) can still use the [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) helper to return information about the user or their authentication state, or to control access to some or all of the Route Handler. The `auth()` helper does require [Middleware](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware). 

    ```tsx filename="app/api/user/route.[jsx/tsx]"
    import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs';

    export async function GET() {

      const { userId } = auth();

      if (!userId) {
        return new NextResponse("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
      }

      // Perform your Route Handler's logic

      return NextResponse.json({ userId }, { status: 200 });
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    A Route Handler added to [`publicRoutes`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#making-pages-public-using-public-routes) can still use the [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) helper to return information about the user or their authentication state, or to control access to some or all of the Route Handler. The `auth()` helper does require [Middleware](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware). 

    In some cases, you may need the full [`User`][user-object] object. For example, if you want to access the user's email address address or name, you can use  [`currentUser()`](/docs/references/nextjs/current-user) helper to get the full [`User`][user-object] object. Under the hood, this calls `fetch()` so it is automatically deduped per request.

   ```tsx filename="app/api/user/route.ts"
    import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
    import { currentUser, auth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export async function GET() {

      const { userId } = auth();

      if (!userId) {
        return new NextResponse("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
      }

      const user = await currentUser();

      // Perform your Route Handler's logic with the returned user object

      return NextResponse.json({ "user": user }, { status: 200 })
    }
  ```

#### Pages Router

<Tabs items={["API Route", "API Route w/ User Fetch", "getServerSideProps"]}>
  <Tab>
    For Next.js applications using the Pages Router, you can get user information or authentication state, or control access to some or all of your API routes by using the [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) helper. The `getAuth()` helper does require [Middleware](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware). 

    ```tsx filename="pages/api/auth.ts"
    import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
    import { getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

    export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
      const { userId } = getAuth(req);

      if (!userId) {
        return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
      }

      // retrieve data from your database
  
      res.status(200).json({});
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

    export default async function handler(
      req: NextApiRequest,
      res: NextApiResponse
    ) {
      const { userId } = getAuth(req);

      if (!userId) {
        return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
      }

      const user = userId ? await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId) : null;

      // use the user object to decide what data to return

      return res.status(200).json({});
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    You can access the active session and user data in your `getServerSideProps` using the [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) helper.

    <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
      Please note the addition of `buildClerkProps` in the return statement, which informs the Clerk React helpers of the authentication state during server-side rendering (like `useAuth()`, `<SignedIn>`, and `<SignedOut>`).

    </Callout>

    ```tsx filename="pages/example.tsx"
    import { getAuth, buildClerkProps } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
    import { GetServerSideProps } from "next";

    export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (ctx) => {
      const { userId } = getAuth(ctx.req);

      if (!userId) {
        // handle user is not logged in.
      }

      // Load any data your application needs for the page using the userId

      return { props: { ...buildClerkProps(ctx.req) } };
    };
    ```

    You can also access the full [`User`][user-object] object before passing it to the page by using the `clerkClient` helper.

    ```tsx filename="pages/example.tsx"
    import { clerkClient } from "@clerk/nextjs";
    import { getAuth, buildClerkProps } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
    import { GetServerSideProps } from "next";

    export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (ctx) => {
      const { userId } = getAuth(ctx.req);

      const user = userId ? await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId) : undefined;

      return { props: { ...buildClerkProps(ctx.req, { user }) } };
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
