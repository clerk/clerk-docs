Updates a user's [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization-membership). Currently, only the role can be updated.

```ts
function updateOrganizationMembership(
  params: UpdateOrganizationMembershipParams,
): Promise<OrganizationMembership>
```

## `UpdateOrganizationMembershipParams`

<Properties>
  - `organizationId`
  - `string`

  The ID of the Organization this membership belongs to.

  ---

  - `userId`
  - `string`

  The ID of the user that this membership belongs to.

  ---

  - `role`
  - `string`

  The [Role](/docs/guides/organizations/roles-and-permissions) to assign the user.
</Properties>

## Example

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

```tsx {{ mark: [5, 17] }}
const organizationId = 'org_123'

const userId = 'user_123'

const role = 'org:admin'

const response = await clerkClient.organizations.updateOrganizationMembership({
  organizationId,
  userId,
  role,
})
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `PATCH/organizations/{organization_id}/memberships/{user_id}`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/organization-memberships/patch/organizations/\{organization_id}/memberships/\{user_id}){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
