title: Protect pages in your Nuxt app with Clerk
description: Learn how to protect the pages in your Clerk + Nuxt application.

There are two ways to protect pages in your Nuxt application:

- [Use the `useAuth()` composable](#use-use-auth)
- [Use `defineNuxtRouteMiddleware()`](#use-define-nuxt-route-middleware)

> [!NOTE]
> To learn how to protect API routes, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/references/nuxt/clerk-middleware#protect-api-routes).

## Use `useAuth()`

<Include src="_partials/vue-nuxt/use-auth" />

## Use `defineNuxtRouteMiddleware()`

The [`defineNuxtRouteMiddleware()`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-nuxt-route-middleware) utility function helps protect pages in your Nuxt application by validating authentication on the client-side. This middleware integrates seamlessly with Clerk authentication.

<Steps>
  ### Configure `defineNuxtRouteMiddleware()`

  In your `middleware/` directory, create a file named `auth.ts` with the following code. This middleware uses the `useAuth()` composable to check if the user is signed in. If they aren't, the middleware redirects them to the sign-in page.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'middleware/auth.ts' }}
  export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(() => {
    const { userId } = useAuth()

    // If the user is not signed in, redirect to the sign-in page
    if (!userId.value) {
      return navigateTo('/sign-in')
    }
  })
  ```

  ### Protect pages with `defineNuxtRouteMiddleware()`

  To protect a page, add the middleware to the `definePageMeta()` function. In the last step, you stored the middleware in the `auth.ts` file, so you would pass `auth` in the `middleware` array.

  ```vue {{ filename: 'pages/dashboard.vue' }}
  <script setup lang="ts">
  definePageMeta({
    // `auth` is the name of the middleware file
    middleware: ['auth'],
  })
  </script>

  <template>
    <h1>Dashboard page</h1>
  </template>
  ```
</Steps>
