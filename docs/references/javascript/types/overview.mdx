# Clerk types

Types are a powerful tool for adding type-safety to your application. They can help you catch bugs early, make your code easier to understand, and make your code easier to refactor. Clerk provides a number of types to help you add type-safety to your application.

To get access to Clerk types, you need to add the `@clerk/types` package to your project. Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  npm install @clerk/types
  ```

  ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  yarn add @clerk/types
  ```

  ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  pnpm add @clerk/types
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>
