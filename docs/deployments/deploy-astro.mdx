# Deploy an Astro app to production

> [!WARNING]
> This guide assumes that you have already installed Clerk in your application locally and are ready to deploy. If you haven't installed Clerk yet, please see our [guide to installing Clerk in your Astro application](/docs/quickstarts/astro) first.

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy your Astro app to production. 

## Deploy your Clerk app to production

Follow the [guide on deploying your Clerk app to production](/docs/deployments/overview).

## Choose an adapter

We recommend you choose one of the [official adapters](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/#official-adapters) Astro offers. Below we are highlighting useful information for each one of them.

- [@astro/cloudflare](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/): âœ… Works as expected
- [@astro/node](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/): âœ… Works as expected
- [@astro/netlify](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/netlify/): ðŸŸ¡ Requires Attention
- [@astro/vercel](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/): ðŸŸ¡ Requires Attention

### Netlify
**Development Instances:** Due to Netlify's caching strategies, one of Clerk's core mechanism is unable to work as expected, resulting in infinite redirects that cause an app to fail. This also affects preview environments that use development API keys. We recommend using [production API keys with a new domain.](/docs/deployments/set-up-preview-environment#acquire-an-additional-root-domain)

### Vercel

## Issues with Edge middleware
The netlify and vercel adapters allow developers to convert the astro middleware to an edge middleware.
Currently, this is expected to not work for the following two reasons.
- Our Astro SDK populates `Astro.locals.auth` with a function that cannot be serialized.
- For developers using Astro and React, SSR would not work as expected as the `clerkMiddleware` uses Async Local Storage, and it's stored value will not persist across the runtimes.
