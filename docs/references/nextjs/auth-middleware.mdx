# `authMiddleware()`

The `authMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Next.js application through middleware. `authMiddleware()` is compatible with both the App and Pages routers.

## Usage

```ts filename="middleware.ts" copy
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default authMiddleware();

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.+[\\w]+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
};
```

With the recommend matcher, all routes are protected by Clerk's authentication middleware, with the exception of internal `/_next/` routes and static files. Static files are detected by matching on paths that end in `.+\..+`. If your middleware needs to run on all routes but you don't want Clerk to protect every route, use the [`ignoredRoutes` option](#options).

### Using `afterAuth()` for fine-grained control

Some developers will need to handle specific cases such as handling redirects differently or detecting if a user is inside an organization. These cases can be handled with `afterAuth()`.

```ts filename="middleware.ts" copy
import { authMiddleware, redirectToSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs';

export default authMiddleware({
  afterAuth(auth, req, evt) {
    // handle users who aren't authenticated
    if (!auth.userId && !auth.isPublicRoute) {
      return redirectToSignIn({ returnBackUrl: req.url });
    }
    // redirect them to organization selection page
    if(auth.userId && !auth.orgId && req.nextUrl.pathname !== "/org-selection"){
      const orgSelection = new URL('/org-selection', req.url)
      return NextResponse.redirect(orgSelection)
    }
  }
});
```

### Using `beforeAuth()` to execute middleware before authentication

If you need additional middleware handlers to execute before Clerk's authentication middleware, use `beforeAuth()`. An example where the middleware handler from `next-intl` is executed can be seen below.

```ts filename="middleware.ts" copy
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

import createMiddleware from "next-intl/middleware";

const intlMiddleware = createMiddleware({
  locales: ["en", "el"],

  defaultLocale: "en",
});

export default authMiddleware({
  beforeAuth: (req) => {
    // Execute next-intl middleware before Clerk's auth middleware
    return intlMiddleware(req);
  },

  // Ensure that locale specific sign-in pages are public
  publicRoutes: ["/", "/:locale/sign-in"],
});

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.+[\\w]+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
};
```

### Making pages public using `publicRoutes`

By default, Clerk's `authMiddleware()` treats all routes as private if the middleware runs. If you need to make specific routes public, use the `publicRoutes` option.

```ts filename="middleware.ts" copy
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";
export default authMiddleware({
  // "/" will be accessible to all users
  publicRoutes: ["/"]
});

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.+[\\w]+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
};
```

If you are building your own sign in pages, you don't need to add these pages to your `publicRoutes`. They will be inferred from your `.env` file:

```ts filename=".env"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/
```

### Execution order of `beforeAuth`, `publicRoutes`, and `afterAuth`
  
If you define an `afterAuth` function, it will run even if the request corresponds to a private route and no user is signed out. If you don’t define an `afterAuth` function, a redirect response to the `signInUrl` will be returned automatically. This diagram explains how and when the two handlers are invoked in the runtime.
