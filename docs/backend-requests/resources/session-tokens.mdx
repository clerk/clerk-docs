When a user is authenticated in your application, Clerk generates a short-lived session token that you can use to authenticate requests to your backend. This token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains information about the user and their session.

Read more about Clerk session tokens and how they work in [the guide on how Clerk works](/docs/how-clerk-works/overview).

## Default claims

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You are reading about version 2 of Clerk's session token claims. To read about version 1, select the respective tab above.

    Every generated token has default claims that cannot be overridden by templates. Clerk's default claims include:

    | Claim | Abbreviation expanded | Description | Example |
    | - | - | - | - |
    | `azp` | authorized party | The `Origin` header that was included in the original Frontend API request made from the user. Most commonly, it will be the URL of the application. This claim could be omitted if, for privacy-related reasons, `Origin` is empty or null. | `https://example.com` |
    | `exp` | expiration time | The time after which the token will expire, as a Unix timestamp. Determined using the **Token lifetime** JWT template setting in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=jwt-templates). See [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4) for more information. | `1713158400` |
    | `fva` | factor verification age | Each item represents the minutes that have passed since the last time a first or second factor, respectively, was verified. | `[7, -1]` which means it has been 7 minutes since the first factor was verified, and there either is not a second factor or the second factor has never been verified. |
    | `iat` | issued at | The time at which the token was issued as a Unix timestamp. See [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.6) for more information. | `1713158400` |
    | `iss` | issuer | The Frontend API URL of your instance. See [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1) for more information. | `https://clerk.your-site.com` for a production instance, `https://your-site.clerk.accounts.dev` for a development instance |
    | `jti` | JWT ID | The unique identifier for the token. See [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7) for more information. | `1234567890` |
    | `nbf` | not before | The time before which the token is considered invalid, as a Unix timestamp. Determined using the **Allowed Clock Skew** JWT template setting in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=jwt-templates). See [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.5) for more information. | `1713158400` |
    | `sid` | session ID | The ID of the current session. | `sess_123` |
    | `sub` | subject | The ID of the current user of the session. See [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2) for more information. | `user_123` |
    | `v` | version | The version number of the session token. | `2` |
    | `pla` | plan | A comma-separated list of the plans that are active. Each entry is in the format `scope:planslug`, where `scope` can be `u` or `o` representing user or org-level plans, respectively. Will always have either one entry (if no org is active) or two entries (if a user and org are both active). | `u:free,o:pro` |
    | `fea` | features | A list of enabled features and their scope. The scope can either be `o` for org-level features, `u` for user-level features, or `uo` for both. | `o:dashboard,o:impersonation` |
    | `sts` | session status | The status of the current session | `pending` |

    The **`o` claim**, or organization claim, is only included if the user is part of an [organization](/docs/organizations/overview) and that organization is [active](/docs/organizations/overview#active-organization). Its value is an object that contains the following properties:

    | Claim | Abbreviation expanded | Description | Example |
    | - | - | - | - |
    | `id` | ID | The ID of the organization. | `org_123` |
    | `slg` | slug | The slug of the organization. | `org-slug` |
    | `rol` | role | The role of the user in the organization, without the `org:` prefix. | `admin` |
    | `per` | permissions | The names of the permissions the user has in the organization. | `read,manage` |
    | `fpm` | feature-permission map | The mapping of features with permissions, where the value of the integer, when converted to binary, represents a bitmask where each bit's position corresponds to a permission in the `o.per` list, and where `0` = `not-allowed` and `1` = `allowed`. | `3,2` |

    > [!WARNING]
    > The organization claims above are intentionally designed to be as compact as possible to keep JWT tokens small.
    > As a result, they can be difficult to decode manually. We strongly recommend using one of our SDKs that support API version [2025-04-10](/docs/versioning/available-versions#2025-04-10) to handle decoding reliably.

    The **`act` (actor) claim** is only included if the user is [impersonating](/docs/users/user-impersonation) another user. It's value is an object that contains the following properties:

    | Claim | Abbreviation expanded | Description | Example |
    | - | - | - | - |
    | `iss` | issuer | The referrer of the token. | `https://dashboard.clerk.com` |
    | `sid` | session ID | The session ID of the impersonated session. | `sess_456` |
    | `sub` | subject | The ID of the impersonator. | `user_456` |

## Custom claims

If you would like to add custom claims to your session token, you can [customize it](/docs/backend-requests/custom-session-token).

You can also create custom tokens using a [JWT template](/docs/backend-requests/jwt-templates).

## Size limitations

Clerk stores the session token in a cookie, and [**most browsers limit cookie size to 4KB**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2109#section-6.3). Exceeding this limit will cause the cookie to not be set, which will break your app as Clerk depends on cookies to work properly.

A session token with the [default session claims](#default-claims) won't run into this issue, as this configuration produces a cookie significantly smaller than 4KB. However, you must consider this limit when implementing a [custom session token](/docs/backend-requests/custom-session-token). After accounting for the size of Clerk's default claims, the cookie can support **up to 1.2KB** of custom claims.

Claims to monitor for size limits:

- `user.organizations`
- `user.public_metadata`
- `user.unsafe_metadata`
- `org.public_metadata`
- `org_membership.public_metadata`

If you add any of these custom claims in your token, use caution to ensure the stored data doesn't exceed the size limit. It's highly recommended to [store the extra data in your own database](/docs/webhooks/sync-data#storing-extra-user-data) instead of storing it in metadata in the session token. If this isn't an option, you can [move particularly large claims like these out of the token](#example) and fetch them using a separate API call from your backend.

> [!NOTE]
> If your application encounters this issue, the Clerk Dashboard will display a warning: **"Some users are exceeding cookie size limits"**. To resolve this, update your [custom session token](/docs/backend-requests/custom-session-token).

### Example

It's recommended to keep the total size of custom claims in the session token under 1.2KB. The following example shows how to move particularly large claims out of the session token and fetch them using a separate API call from your backend. The limitations of this approach are that if you make this call to Clerk's Backend API frequently, you risk hitting [rate limits](/docs/backend-requests/resources/rate-limits) and it's also slower than making a database query. We highly recommend [storing the extra data in your own database](/docs/webhooks/sync-data#storing-extra-user-data) instead of storing it in metadata in the session token.

For example, if you were storing several fields in `user.public_metadata`, like this:

```js {{ prettier: false }}
// user.public_metadata
{
  onboardingComplete: true,
  birthday: '2000-01-01',
  country: 'Canada',
  bio: 'This is a bio -- imagine it is 6kb of written info',
}
```

Instead of storing all of that data in the session token, and possibly exceeding the 4KB limit, like this:

```json
// Custom claims in the session token
{
  "metadata": "{{user.public_metadata}}"
}
```

You could store only the necessary data in the session token - for example, just the `onboardingComplete` field - like this:

```json
// Custom claims in the session token
{
  "onboardingComplete": "{{user.public_metadata.onboardingComplete}}"
}
```

If you need to access the other fields, you can fetch them using a separate API call from your backend. The following example uses the [`getUser()`](/docs/references/backend/user/get-user) method to access the current user's [Backend `User` object](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-user), which includes the `publicMetadata` field.

## Validate session tokens

If you're using the middleware provided by our Clerk SDKs, validating session tokens is handled automatically in every request. If you're not using the middleware, you can still use the respective helpers provided by the SDKs to validate the tokens.

To learn how to manually verify a session token, refer to the [dedicated guide](/docs/backend-requests/manual-jwt).
