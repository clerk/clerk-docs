# First Factor

These are all methods on [the `SignIn` class](/reference-js/sign-in/sign-in) that allow you to handle the first factor of a multi-factor authentication flow.


## `prepareFirstFactor()`

```
prepareFirstFactor(params: PrepareFirstFactorParams) => Promise<SignInResource>
```

Begins the first factor verification process. This is a required step in order to complete a sign in, as users should be verified at least by one factor of authentication.

Common scenarios are one-time code (OTP) or social account (SSO) verification. This is determined by the accepted `strategy` parameter values. Each authentication identifier supports different strategies.

**Parameters**

| Name   | Description                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| params | [*PrepareFirstFactorParams*](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/clerkjs/signin#prepare-first-factor) An object that allows you to specify a verification strategy and any strategy-specific additional data. |

**Returns**

| Type                    | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| {"Promise<SignInResource>"} | This method returns a `Promise` which resolves with a `SignIn` object. Check the `firstFactorVerification` attribute for the status of the first factor verification process. |

## `attemptFirstFactor()`

```
attemptFirstFactor(params: AttemptFirstFactorParams) => Promise<SignInResource>
```

Attempts to complete the first factor verification process. This is a required step in order to complete a sign in, as users should be verified at least by one factor of authentication.

Make sure that a `SignIn` object already exists before you call this method, either by first calling `SignIn.create` or `SignIn.prepareFirstFactor`. The only strategy that does not require a verification to have already been prepared before attempting to complete it, is the **password** strategy.

Depending on the strategy that was selected when the verification was prepared, the method parameters should be different.

**Parameters**

| Name   | Description                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| params | [*AttemptFirstFactorParams*](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/clerkjs/signin#attempt-first-factor) An object that includes the verification strategy and the evidence that's needed to identify the user and complete the verification process. |

**Returns**

| Type                    | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| {"Promise<SignInResource>"} | This method returns a `Promise` which resolves with a `SignIn` object. Check the `firstFactorVerification` attribute for the status of the first factor verification process. |
