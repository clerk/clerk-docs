Creating a Clerk account and using it in your apps is a simple three-step process:

<Steps>
  ### Step 1: Create a Clerk account

  [Go to Clerk's sign-up page](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up) and create an account.

  <br />

  {/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}

  <div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)", maxWidth: "400px"}}>![An interactive "Create your account" card which provides sign-up options for a GitHub or Google account as well as email and password.](./create-clerk-account.png)</div>

  <br />

  ### Step 2: Create a Clerk application

  Once you've created an account, you'll be redirected to [your Clerk dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).

  On a freshly created account, you won't have any applications. To create one, press the "Add application" card:

  <br />

  {/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}

  <div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)", maxWidth: "400px"}}>![An "Add application" card on your dashboard](./add-application.png)</div>

  <br />

  When the "Add application" card is pressed, you'll be directed to create your `<SignIn>` component and select your preferred
  auth providers.

  <br />

  {/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}

  <div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)"}}>![An interactive builder to make your "SignIn" component truly yours, which lets you select your auth providers.](./create-sign-in-comp.png)</div>

  <br />

  > [We provide over 20 authentication providers that you can utilize in your Clerk apps.](/users/authentication-providers/overview)

  Once done, you should see a list of API keys that make setting up a new codebase easier.

  <br />

  {/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}

  <div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)"}}>![A list of supported frameworks with instructions on how to add API keys underneath.](./env-keys.png)</div>

  <br />

  ### Step 3: Spin up a new codebase

  The API keys listed in the dashboard are just the first step to integrating Clerk into your apps. To get the most out
  of Clerk, check out our "Quickstart" guides:
