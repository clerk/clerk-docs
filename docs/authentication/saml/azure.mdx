## Tutorial

<Steps>
  ### Set up an enterprise connection in Clerk

  To create a SAML connection in Clerk:

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).
  1. In the navigation sidebar, select **User & Authentication > [Enterprise Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/enterprise-connections)**.
  1. Select the **Create connection** button.
  1. You will be presented with a modal to create a new connection. Fill in the required fields and for the **Identity Provider**, select **Microsoft Azure Entra ID (Formerly AD)**.
  1. Next, on the **Connection** page, **do not select the Enable connection toggle just yet.** You need to fully configure your IdP first before exposing your connection to your users.
  1. Leave this page open. You will need to come back to it to complete the setup.

  ### Create a new enterprise application in Azure

  To create a new enterprise application in Azure:

  1. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/azure-portal) and sign in.
  1. Under the **Azure Services** section, find and select **Enterprise Applications**. You may have to go to the [**All services**](https://portal.azure.com/#allservices) page and then scroll down to the \*_Identity_ section to find it.
  1. Select the **New Application** button.
  1. Select the **Create your own application** button.
  1. Fill in the required fields and select the **Create** button.

  ### Assign selected user or group in Azure

  Now that you have created the enterprise application, you need to assign your users/user groups to it. For example, if you were part of the Clerk organization, you would have access to users and groups in the Clerk organization. In this case, you could assign one or more users or entire groups to the enterprise application you just created.

  1. Under the **Getting started** section, select **Assign users and groups**.
  1. Select the **Add user/group** button.
  1. Under **Users**, select the **None Selected** link.
  1. In the search field, enter the user or group of users that you want to assign to the enterprise application.
  1. Select the check box next to the user or group that you want to assign.
  1. Select the **Select** button at the bottom of the page.
  1. Select the **Assign** button at the bottom of the page.

  ### Configure single sign-on (SSO) in Azure

  After you have assigned the user or group of users to the enterprise application, you need to configure the single sign-on (SSO) settings to enable SAML SSO.

  1. In the navigation sidebar, select **Overview**.
  1. Under the _Getting started_ section, select **Set up single sign-on**.
  1. Select **SAML** as the single sign-on method.

  ### Configure your service provider

  To configure your service provider (Clerk), you must add these two fields to your IdP's application:

  - **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** - This is a unique identifier for your SAML connection that your IdP application needs.
  - **Identifier (Entity ID)** - This is your application's URL that your IdP will redirect your users back to after they have authenticated in your IdP.

  To fill out the appropriate values for these fields:

  1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, you will see the **Basic SAML Configuration** section. Select the **Edit** button. This will open a **Basic SAML Configuration** modal.
  1. Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and scroll down to the **Service Provider configuration** section.
  1. Copy the **Identifier (Entity ID)** and the **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)**.
  1. In the Azure Portal, in the **Basic SAML Configuration** modal, paste these values into their respective fields.
  1. Select **Save** at the top of the modal.

  ### Configure your identity provider

  1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, find the **SAML Certificates** section.
  1. Copy the **App Federation Metadata Url**.
  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, find the **Identity Provider configuration** section.
  1. Under the **Metadata configuration** option, paste the **App Federation Metadata Url**.

  ### Map Azure claims to Clerk attributes

  Mapping the claims in your IdP to the attributes in Clerk ensures that the data from your IdP is correctly mapped to the data in Clerk.

  | Clerk attribute | Azure claim |
  | - | - |
  | `mail` | `user.userprincipalname` |
  | `firstName` | `user.givenname` |
  | `lastName` | `user.surname` |

  The only Azure claim that is necessary to map is the email address claim. This is the email address that your users will use to log in to your application.

  1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, find the **Attributes & Claims** section.
  1. Select the **Edit** button.
  1. Select the email address claim (`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress`) to edit the field.
  1. Next to **Source attribute**, select the dropdown and choose `user.userprincipalname`.
  1. Select **Save** at the top of the page.

  ### Enable the connection for Clerk

  To make the connection available for your users to authenticate with:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, scroll to the top of the **Connection** page.
  1. Toggle on the **Enable connection** option.
