title: Use Clerk's MCP server
description: Connect AI agents to Clerk's MCP server to get SDK snippets and patterns.
---

<Include src="_partials/mcp/mcp-beta-callout" />

Clerk provides a remote [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that allows AI agents like Claude, Cursor, and Github Copilot to access Clerk SDK snippets and implementation patterns. This provides AI agents with up-to-date code examples when developing with Clerk.

The Clerk MCP server provides:

- **SDK snippets**: Ready-to-use code patterns for common Clerk features
- **Implementation guides**: Best practices for authentication flows, organizations, and more
- **Framework-specific examples**: Patterns optimized for Next.js, React, and other supported frameworks
