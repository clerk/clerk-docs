How to set up social connection with GitLab

## Overview

Adding social connection with GitLab to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses  preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your GitLab account.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a GitLab account and a  GitLab OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a GitLab account. To create one, [click here](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up).

## Configuring GitLab social connection

First, you need to register a new OAuth GitLab app. Follow the official GitLab instructions on [how to create an OAuth app](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#user-owned-applications).

You need to add a name for your new application and the **Redirect URI**. In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)** and enable GitLab. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Go back to the GitLab panel, paste the value into the **Redirect URI**, select any scopes that would you like your users to provide and save the application.

Once creation is complete, you'll get redirected to application's panel. Copy the **Application ID** and **Secret.** Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with GitLab is now configured for your instance.
