# Set up your Clerk account

Before you can start integrating Clerk into your application, you need to create a Clerk account and set up a new application in the Clerk Dashboard. This guide will walk you through those steps.

<Steps>

### Sign into Clerk

[Create a Clerk account](https://dashboard.clerk.com/sign-up) or [sign into your Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).

### Create a Clerk application

If you've just created an account for the first time, you'll be taken directly to the interactive authentication setup form.

Otherwise, you'll be redirected to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). To create a new app, select the **Create application** card to be taken to the interactive authentication setup form.

### Select identifiers and social providers

Once you are in the interactive authentication setup form, you will be asked to build your authentication flow. Here, Clerk provides various options for setting up your sign-up and sign-in flows. You can choose to use email, phone, or username as [identifiers](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#identifiers), and you can enable [social authentication providers](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview).

Once the application is created, you can also customize your authentication flow by selecting different authentication strategies, verification methods, and more. [Learn more about sign-up and sign-in options.](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options)

### Integrate Clerk into your application

Now that your application is created in the Clerk Dashboard, you can integrate it into your codebase. To integrate Clerk into your application, use one of our [quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts/overview):
