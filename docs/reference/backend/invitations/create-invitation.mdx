title: '`createInvitation()`'
description: Use Clerk's JS Backend SDK to create a new invitation for the given email address, and send the invitation email.
sdk: js-backend

{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/api/endpoints/InvitationApi.ts#L42 */}

Creates a new [`Invitation`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-invitation) for the given email address and sends the invitation email.

If an email address has already been invited or already exists in your application, trying to create a new invitation will return an error. To bypass this error and create a new invitation anyways, set `ignoreExisting` to `true`.

```ts
function createInvitation(params: CreateParams): Promise<Invitation>
```

## `CreateParams`

<Properties>
  - `emailAddress`
  - `string`

  The email address of the user to invite.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The full URL or path where the user is redirected upon visiting the invitation link, where they can accept the invitation. Required if you have implemented a [custom flow for handling application invitations](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/application-invitations).

  ---

  - `publicMetadata?`
  - [`UserPublicMetadata`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/metadata#user-public-metadata)

  Metadata that can be read from both the Frontend API and [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }}, but can be set only from the Backend API. Once the user accepts the invitation and signs up, these metadata will end up in the user's public metadata.

  ---

  - `notify?`
  - `boolean`

  Whether an email invitation should be sent to the given email address. Defaults to `true`.

  ---

  - `ignoreExisting?`
  - `boolean`

  Whether an invitation should be created if there is already an existing invitation for this email address, or if the email address already exists in the application. Defaults to `false`.

  ---

  - `expiresInDays?`
  - `number`

  The number of days the invitation will be valid for. By default, the invitation expires after 30 days.

  ---

  - `templateSlug?`
  - `'invitation' | 'waitlist_invitation'`

  The slug of the email template to use for the invitation email. Defaults to `invitation`.
</Properties>

## Usage

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.invitations.createInvitation({
  emailAddress: 'invite@example.com',
  redirectUrl: 'https://www.example.com/my-sign-up',
  publicMetadata: {
    example: 'metadata',
    example_nested: {
      nested: 'metadata',
    },
  },
})
```

## Example

<Include src="_partials/create-invitation" />

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `POST/invitations`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/invitations/post/invitations){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.

Here's an example of making a request directly to the endpoint using cURL.

<SignedIn>
  Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite. Your Clerk Secret Key is already injected into the code snippet.
</SignedIn>

<SignedOut>
  Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite. Update `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your Clerk Secret Key which can be found on the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
</SignedOut>

```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
curl https://api.clerk.com/v1/invitations -X POST -d '{"email_address": "email@example.com"}' -H "Authorization:Bearer {{secret}}" -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
```
