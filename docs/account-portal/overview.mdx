# Overview

The Account Portal in Clerk is a powerful feature that allows you to streamline the sign-in, sign-up, and profile management experience for your users, without having to build your own components or host your own pages.

# Why use the Account Portal?

The Account Portal provides all the pages your users need to sign-up, sign-in, and manage their accounts, all while maintaining seamless integration with your application. These pages are hosted on Clerk servers for you and they require minimal setup to get started. If youâ€™re looking for the fastest way to get your application up and running, then this is a great choice.

However, if you require more precise customization or prefer having your application self-contained, then we would recommend using our [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) or [custom flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview) instead.

# How the Account Portal works

The Account Portal uses our [prebuilt Clerk components](/docs/components/overview) embedded on dedicated pages hosted for your application. Users are automatically redirected to and from your application for a seamless authentication experience.

For each application environment, Clerk provides hosted pages including sign-up, sign-in, user profiles, organization profiles, and an organization creation flow.

For development environments, Clerk will issue you a randomly generated domain on "lcl.dev". In production, by default, the URLs for your Account Portal are the following:

```sh
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/sign-in
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/sign-up
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/user
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/organization
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/create-organization
```

You can access these links under **Account Portal -> Pages** in your Clerk dashboard.
