![The \<SignIn /> component renders a UI for signing in users.](/docs/images/ui-components/sign-in.png){{ style: { maxWidth: '460px' } }}

The `<SignIn />` component renders a UI to allow users to sign in or sign up by default. The functionality of the `<SignIn />` component is controlled by the instance settings you specify in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), such as [sign-in and sign-up options](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options) and [social connections](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/all-providers). You can further customize your `<SignIn />` component by passing additional [properties](#properties) at the time of rendering. The `<SignIn />` component also displays any [session tasks](!session-tasks) that are required for the user to complete after signing in.

> [!NOTE]
> The `<SignUp/>` and `<SignIn/>` components cannot render when a user is already signed in, unless the application allows multiple sessions. If a user is already signed in and the application only allows a single session, Clerk will redirect the user to the Home URL instead.

  ## Usage with JavaScript

  The following methods available on an instance of the [`Clerk`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk) class are used to render and control the `<SignIn />` component:

  - [`mountSignIn()`](#mount-sign-in)
  - [`unmountSignIn()`](#unmount-sign-in)
  - [`openSignIn()`](#open-sign-in)

## Properties

All props are optional.

<Properties>
  - `appearance`
  - <code>[Appearance](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/overview) | undefined</code>

  Optional object to style your components. Will only affect [Clerk components](/docs/reference/components/overview) and not [Account Portal](/docs/guides/account-portal/overview) pages.

  ---

  - `fallback`
  - `ReactNode`

  An optional element to be rendered while the component is mounting.

  ---

  - `fallbackRedirectUrl`
  - `string`

  The fallback URL to redirect to after the user signs in, if there's no `redirect_url` in the path already. Defaults to `/`. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.

  ---

  - `forceRedirectUrl`
  - `string`

  If provided, this URL will always be redirected to after the user signs in. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.

  ---

  - `initialValues`
  - [`SignInInitialValues`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sign-in-initial-values)

  The values used to prefill the sign-in fields with.

  ---

  - `oauthFlow`
  - `"redirect" | "popup" | "auto"`

  Determines how OAuth authentication is performed. Accepts the following properties:

  - `"redirect"`: Redirect to the OAuth provider on the current page.
  - `"popup"`: Open a popup window.
  - `"auto"`: Choose the best method based on whether the current domain typically requires the `"popup"` flow to correctly perform authentication.

  Defaults to `"auto"`.

  ---

  - `path`
  - `string`

  ---

  - `routing`
  - `'hash' | 'path'`

  The [routing](/docs/guides/how-clerk-works/routing) strategy for your pages. Defaults to `'path'` for frameworks that handle routing, such as Next.js and Remix. Defaults to `hash` for all other SDK's, such as React.

  ---

  - `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl`
  - `string`

  The fallback URL to redirect to after the user signs up, if there's no `redirect_url` in the path already. Used for the 'Don't have an account? Sign up' link that's rendered. Defaults to `/`. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.

  ---

  - `signUpForceRedirectUrl`
  - `string`

  If provided, this URL will always used as the redirect destination after the user signs up. Used for the 'Don't have an account? Sign up' link that's rendered.

  ---

  - `signUpUrl`
  - `string`

  ---

  - `transferable`
  - `boolean`

  Indicates whether or not sign in attempts are transferable to the sign up flow. Defaults to `true`. When set to `false`, prevents opaque sign ups when a user attempts to sign in via OAuth with an email that doesn't exist.

  Full URL or path to the waitlist page. Use this property to provide the target of the 'Waitlist' link that's rendered. If `undefined`, will redirect to the [Account Portal waitlist page](/docs/guides/account-portal/overview#waitlist). If you've passed the `waitlistUrl` prop to the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/reference/components/clerk-provider) component, it will infer from that, and you can omit this prop.

  ---

  - `withSignUp`
  - `boolean`

  Opt into sign-in-or-up flow by setting this prop to `true`. When `true`, if a user does not exist, they will be prompted to sign up. If a user exists, they will be prompted to sign in. Defaults to `true` if the `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` environment variable is set. Otherwise, defaults to `false`.
</Properties>

## Customization

To learn about how to customize Clerk components, see the [customization documentation](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/overview).

If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview).
