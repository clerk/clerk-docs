# Phone Verificaiton

Test


## `preparePhoneNumberVerification()`

```typescript
function preparePhoneNumberVerification(params?: PreparePhoneNumberVerificationParams): Promise<SignUp>;
```

Helper method that allows you to initiate a verification process for a phone number. It basically sends a one-time code to the phone number already supplied to the current sign up.

This is equivalent to calling `SignUp.prepareVerification("phone_code")`.

## `attemptPhoneNumberVerification()`

```typescript
function attemptPhoneNumberVerification(params: AttemptPhoneNumberVerificationParams): Promise<SignUp>;
```

Helper method that attempts to complete the verification process for a phone number. It basically verifies that the supplied code is the same as the one-time code that was sent to the phone number during the prepare verification phase.

This is equivalent to calling `SignUp.attemptVerification({strategy: "phone_code", ...params})`.
