The following example **will both sign up _and_ sign in users**, eliminating the need for a separate sign-up page. However, if you want to have separate sign-up and sign-in pages, the sign-up and sign-in flows are equivalent, meaning that all you have to do is swap out the `SignIn` object for the `SignUp` object using the [`useSignUp()`](/docs/hooks/use-sign-up) hook.

The following example:

1. Accesses the [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in) object using the [`useSignIn()`](/docs/hooks/use-sign-in) hook.
1. Starts the authentication process by calling [`SignIn.authenticateWithRedirect(params)`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in#authenticate-with-redirect). This method requires a `redirectUrl` param, which is the URL that the browser will be redirected to once the user authenticates with the identity provider.
1. Creates a route at the URL that the `redirectUrl` param points to. The following example names this route `/sso-callback`. This route should either render the prebuilt [`<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback/>`](/docs/components/control/authenticate-with-callback) component or call the [`Clerk.handleRedirectCallback()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk#handle-redirect-callback) method if you're not using the prebuilt component.

The following example shows two files:

1. The sign-in page where the user can start the authentication flow.
1. The SSO callback page where the flow is completed.
