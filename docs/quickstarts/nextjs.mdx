  - Install `@clerk/nextjs`
  - Set up your environment keys to test your app locally
  - Add `<ClerkProvider />` to your application
  - Use Clerk middleware to implement route-specific authentication
  - Create a header with Clerk components for users to sign in and out
</TutorialHero>

<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/nextjs`

  Clerk's [Next.js SDK](/docs/references/nextjs/overview) has prebuilt components, React hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  To get started using Clerk with Next.js, add the SDK to your project:

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/nextjs
    ```

    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/nextjs
    ```

    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/nextjs
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your environment variables

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env.local` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
    1. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
    1. Paste your keys into your `.env.local` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ prettier: false, filename: '.env.local' }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ### Add Middleware to your application

  [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#clerk-middleware) grants you access to user authentication state throughout your application, on any route or page. It also allows you to protect specific routes from unauthenticated users. To add `clerkMiddleware()` to your application, follow these steps:

  1. Create a `middleware.ts` file.
     - If you're using the `/src` directory, place `middleware.ts` in the `/src` directory.
     - If you're not using the `/src` directory, place `middleware.ts` in the root directory alongside `.env.local`.

  1. In your middleware.ts, export Clerk's `clerkMiddleware()` helper:

  ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
  import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

  export default clerkMiddleware();

  export const config = {
    matcher: [
      // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
      '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
      // Always run for API routes
      '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
    ],
  };
  ```

  3. By default, `clerkMiddleware()` will not protect any routes. All routes are public and you must opt-in to protection for routes. See the [`clerkMiddleware()` reference](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware) to learn how to require authentication for specific routes.

  ### Add `<ClerkProvider>` and components to your app

  All Clerk hooks and components must be children of the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component, which provides active session and user context.

  You can control which content signed in and signed out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview). To get started, create a header for your users to sign in or out. To do this, you will use:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button): A prebuilt component that comes styled out of the box to show the avatar from the account the user is signed in with.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page or displays the sign-in modal.

  Select your preferred router to learn how to make this data available across your entire app:

  <CodeBlockTabs type="router" options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'app/layout.tsx', mark: [10, [13, 20], 26] }}
    import { ClerkProvider, SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from '@clerk/nextjs'
    import './globals.css';

    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode
    }) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider>
          <html lang="en">
            <body>
              <header>
                <SignedOut>
                  <SignInButton />
                </SignedOut>
                <SignedIn>
                  <UserButton />
                </SignedIn>
              </header>
              <main>
                {children}
              </main>
            </body>
          </html>
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    }
    ```

    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'pages/_app.tsx', mark: [[7, 15]] }}
    import '@/styles/globals.css'
    import { ClerkProvider, SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from '@clerk/nextjs'
    import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

    function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
            <SignedOut>
              <SignInButton />
            </SignedOut>
            <SignedIn>
              <UserButton />
            </SignedIn>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    }

    export default MyApp;
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>
