---

The `<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />` component is a crucial part of implementing custom OAuth flows in your application. It serves as the callback handler for the authentication process initiated by the `authenticateWithRedirect()` method. Render it on the route specified as the `redirectUrl` in your `authenticateWithRedirect()` call.

This component automatically handles the OAuth callback, completing the authentication process and managing the user's session. It uses the [`handleRedirectCallback()`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#handle-redirect-callback) method under the hood.

## Example

For an example of how to use the `<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />` component, see the [custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/oauth-connections) guide.
