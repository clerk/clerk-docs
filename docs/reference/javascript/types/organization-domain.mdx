function delete(): Promise<void>
```

## `prepareAffiliationVerification()`

Begins the verification process of a created Organization domain. This is a required step in order to complete the registration of the domain under the Organization.

): Promise<OrganizationDomain>
```

### `PrepareAffiliationVerificationParams`

<Properties>

## `attemptAffiliationVerification()`

Attempts to complete the domain verification process. This is a required step in order to complete the registration of a domain under an Organization, as the administrator should be verified as a person who is affiliated with that domain.

Make sure that an `OrganizationDomain` object already exists before you call this method, by first calling [`OrganizationDomain.prepareAffiliationVerification`](#prepare-affiliation-verification).

```typescript
function attemptAffiliationVerification(
  params: AttemptAffiliationVerificationParams,
): Promise<OrganizationDomain>
```
