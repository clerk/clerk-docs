Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Ruby app. If you would like to use a framework, see the [reference docs](/docs/reference/ruby/overview).

<Steps>
  ## Create a new Ruby app

  If you don't already have a Ruby app, run the following commands to [create a new one](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html).

  ```bash
  rails new clerk-ruby
  cd clerk-ruby
  ```

  ## Install `clerk-sdk-ruby`

  <Include src="_partials/ruby/installation" />

  ## Configuration

  <Include src="_partials/ruby/configuration" />

  ## Instantiate a `Clerk::SDK` instance

  All available methods are listed in the [Ruby SDK documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-ruby?tab=readme-ov-file#available-resources-and-operations){{ target: '_blank' }}, which provides a more Ruby-friendly interface.

  To access available methods, you must instantiate a `Clerk::SDK` instance.

  ```ruby
  sdk = Clerk::SDK.new
  req = Clerk::Models::Operations::CreateUserRequest.new(
    first_name: "John",
    last_name: "Doe",
    email_address: ["john.doe@example.com"],
    password: "password"
  )

  # Create a user
  sdk.users.create(request: create_user_request)

  # List all users and ensure the user was created
  sdk.users.list(request: Clerk::Models::Operations::GetUserListRequest.new())

  # Get the first user created in your instance
  user = sdk.users.list(request: Clerk::Models::Operations::GetUserListRequest.new(limit: 1)).first

  # Use the user's ID to lock the user
  sdk.users.lock_user(user_id: user.id)

  # Then, unlock the user so they can sign in again
  sdk.users.unlock_user(user_id: user.id)
  ```

  ## Run your project

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```bash
  rails server
  ```
</Steps>
