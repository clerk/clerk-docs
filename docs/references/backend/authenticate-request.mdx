title: '`authenticateRequest()`'
description: Use Clerk's Backend SDK to verify a token passed from the frontend.
---

{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/tokens/request.ts#L62 */}

Authenticates a token passed from the frontend. Networkless if the `jwtKey` is provided. Otherwise, performs a network call to retrieve the JWKS from the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/JWKS#operation/GetJWKS){{ target: '_blank' }}.

```ts
function authenticateRequest(
  request: Request,
  options: AuthenticateRequestOptions,
): Promise<RequestState>
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `request`
  - `Request`

  `Request` object

  ---

  - `options?`
  - [`AuthenticateRequestOptions`](#authenticate-request-options)

  Optional options to configure the authentication.
</Properties>

## `AuthenticateRequestOptions`

It is recommended to set these options as [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#api-and-sdk-configuration) where possible, and then pass them to the function. For example, you can set the `secretKey` option using the `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variable, and then pass it to the function like this: `createClerkClient({ secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY })`.

> [!WARNING]
> You must provide either `jwtKey` or `secretKey`.
>
> For better security, it's highly recommended to explicitly set the `authorizedParties` option when authorizing requests. The value should be a list of domains that are allowed to make requests to your application. Not setting this value can open your application to [CSRF attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf).

## Examples

<Tabs items={["Backend SDK on its own", "With other Clerk SDKs"]}>
  <Tab>
    If you are using the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) on its own, you need to provide the `secretKey` and `publishableKey` to `createClerkClient()` so that it is passed to `authenticateRequest()`. You can set these values as [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#clerk-publishable-and-secret-keys) and then pass them to the function.

    ```tsx
    import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend'

    export async function GET(req: Request) {
      const clerkClient = createClerkClient({
        secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY,
        publishableKey: process.env.CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
      })

      const { isSignedIn } = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(req, {
        authorizedParties: ['https://example.com'],
      })

      if (!isSignedIn) {
        return Response.json({ status: 401 })
      }

      // Add logic to perform protected actions

      return Response.json({ message: 'This is a reply' })
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    `authenticateRequest()` requires `publishableKey` to be set. If you are importing `clerkClient` from a higher-level SDK, such as Next.js, then `clerkClient` infers the `publishableKey` from your [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#clerk-publishable-and-secret-keys). The following example uses Next.js, but the same logic applies for other frameworks.

    ```tsx
    import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    const client = await clerkClient()

    export async function GET(req: Request) {
      const { isSignedIn } = await client.authenticateRequest(req, {
        authorizedParties: ['https://example.com'],
      })

      if (!isSignedIn) {
        return Response.json({ status: 401 })
      }

      // Perform protected actions
      // Add logic to perform protected actions

      return Response.json({ message: 'This is a reply' })
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

### Networkless token verification

{/* Note: this example is duped from /authenticate-request. Probably a good opportunity to use a partial here */}

The following example uses the `authenticateRequest()` method with the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) to verify the token passed by the frontend, and performs a networkless authentication by passing `jwtKey`. This will verify if the user is signed into the application or not.
