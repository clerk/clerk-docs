# Dedicated Hosted Pages

For every instance, Clerk offers sign-up, sign-in, and user profile pages out of the box. Additionally, if you are using our Organizations feature, you will also get the organization profile page.
You can access these links via the 'pages' tab under Account Portal in your Clerk dashboard.

For development instances, Clerk will issue you a domain on "lcl.dev". In production, by default, the URLs for your Account Portal are the following: 

```sh 
https://accounts.[your-domain].com/sign-in
https://accounts.[your-domain].com/sign-up
https://accounts.[your-domain].com/user
https://accounts.[your-domain].com/organization
https://accounts.[your-domain].com/create-organization
```
