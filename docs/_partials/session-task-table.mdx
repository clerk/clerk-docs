Each task is identified by a unique [`SessionTask['key']`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/session-task). You can use these task keys to conditionally handle different requirements in your application logic.

The following table lists the available tasks and their corresponding keys.

| Setting | Key | Description |
| - | - | - |
| [Allow Personal Accounts](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings) | `choose-organization` | Disabled by default when enabling Organizations. When disabled, users are required to choose an Organization after authenticating. When enabled, users can choose a [Personal Account](!personal-account) instead of an Organization. |
| [Force password reset](/docs/guides/secure/password-protection-and-rules#manually-set-a-password-as-compromised) | `reset-password` | [Enabled by default for instances created after December 8, 2025](!update). When enabled, the user is required to reset their password on their next sign-in if their password is marked as compromised. If your instance is older than December 8, 2025, you will need to update your instance to the **Reset password session task** update. |
