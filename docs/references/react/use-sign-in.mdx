# `useSignIn()`

The `useSignIn()` hook provides access to the [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-in. This is also useful for creating a custom sign-in flow.

## `useSignIn()` returns

<Properties>
  - `isLoaded`
  - `boolean`

  A boolean that is set to `false` until Clerk loads and initializes.

  ---

  - `setActive()`
  - <code>(params: [SetActiveParams](#set-active-params)) => Promise\<void></code>

  A function that sets the active session.

  ---

  - `signIn`
  - [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in)

  An object that contains the current sign-in attempt status and methods to create a new sign-in attempt.
</Properties>

### `SetActiveParams`

<Properties>
  - `session`
  - <code>[Session](/docs/references/javascript/session) | string | null</code>

  The session resource or session ID (string version) to be set as active. If `null`, the current session is deleted.

  ---

  - `organization`
  - <code>[Organization](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) | string | null</code>

  The organization resource or organization ID/slug (string version) to be set as active in the current session. If `null`, the currently active organization is removed as active.

  ---

  - `beforeEmit?`
  - `(session?: Session | null) => void | Promise<any>`

  Callback run just before the active session and/or organization is set to the passed object. Can be used to hook up for pre-navigation actions.
</Properties>

## How to use the `useSignIn()` hook

### Check the current state of a sign-in with `useSignIn()`

Use the `useSignIn()` hook to check the current state of a sign-in.

```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'pages/sign-in-step.tsx' }}
import { useSignIn } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export default function SignInStep() {
  const { isLoaded, signIn } = useSignIn();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Add logic to handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  return <div>The current sign in attempt status is {signIn.status}.</div>;
}
```

The `status` property of the `SignIn` object can be one of the following values:

| Values | Descriptiom |
| - | - |
| `complete` | The user has been signed in and custom flow can proceed to `setActive()` to create session. |
| `needs_first_factor` | The First Factor verification is missing. One of `email_link`, `email_code`, `phone_code`, `web3_metamask_signature` or `oauth_provider` is required to verify user. See [First Factor](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/first-factor) for details. |
| `needs_second_factor` | The Second Factor verification is missing. The Second Factor is an optional step to provide additional verification and includes `phone_code` and `totp`. See [Second Factor](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/second-factor) for details. |
| `needs_identifier` | The user's identifier (email address, phone number, username, etc.) hasn't been provided. |
| `needs_new_password` | The user needs to set a new password. |

### Create a custom sign-in flow with `useSignIn()`

The `useSignIn()` hook can also be used to build fully custom sign-in flows, if Clerk's pre-built components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow. Different sign-in flows include email and password, email and phone codes, email links, and multifactor (MFA). To learn more about using the `useSignIn()` hook to create custom flows, check out the [custom flow guides](https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/overview).
