description: Learn how to add organizations to your application with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

Organizations let you group users with roles and permissions, enabling you to build multi-tenant B2B apps like Slack (workspaces), Linear (teams), or Vercel (projects) where users can switch between different team contexts.

<Steps>
  ## Enable organizations

  Organizations are disabled by default. To enable them:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Organizations Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings) page.
  1. Select **Enable Organizations**.
  1. In the modal, choose whether to allow personal accounts:
     - **Personal accounts disabled (default)**: Every user must belong to an organization. This is recommended for most B2B applications.
     - **Personal accounts enabled**: Users can operate in their own individual workspace or join organizations.
  1. Select **Enable**.

  Learn more about configuring organizations in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/organizations/configure).

  ## Add the `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component

  The [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher) component is the easiest way to let users create, switch between, and manage organizations. It's recommended to add it in your app's header or navigation so that it's always readily available to your users. For example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'components/Header.tsx' }}
  export default function Header() {
    return (
      <header>
        <OrganizationSwitcher />
      </header>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Access organization data

  <Tabs items={['Client-side', 'Server-side']}>
    <Tab>
      Use Clerk's [`useOrganization()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-organization) hook to access information about the currently active organization. Use Clerk's [`useOrganizationList()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-organization-list) hook to access information about the current user's organization memberships.

      ```tsx
      export default function Page() {
        const { organization } = useOrganization()
        const { userMemberships } = useOrganizationList({
          userMemberships: true,
        })

        return (
          <div className="p-8">
            <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
              Welcome to the <strong>{organization?.name}</strong> organization
            </h1>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Your role in this organization:{' '}
              <strong>
                {/* Find the organization membership that matches the
                  currently active organization and return the role */}
                {
                  userMemberships?.data?.find(
                    (membership) => membership.organization.id === organization?.id,
                  )?.role
                }
              </strong>
            </p>
          </div>
        )
      }
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      [Clerk's JS Backend SDK](/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart) provides methods for accessing organization data server-side. For example, to get information about an organization, you can use the [`getOrganization()`](/docs/reference/backend/organization/get-organization) method. It requires the organization ID, which can be accessed through the [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object.

      This example is written for Next.js App Router, but can be adapted to other frameworks by using the appropriate method for accessing the [`Auth` object](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object), and the appropriate initialization for `clerkClient()`.

      ```tsx
      import { auth, clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
      import { OrganizationSwitcher } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default async function Page() {
        // The `Auth` object gives you access to properties like `orgId`
        // Accessing the `Auth` object differs depending on the SDK you're using
        // https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#how-to-access-the-auth-object
        const { orgId } = await auth()

        // Check if there is an active organization
        if (!orgId) {
          return (
            <>
              <p>Set an active organization to access this page.</p>
              <OrganizationSwitcher />
            </>
          )
        }

        // To fetch the active organization server-side,
        // first initialize the JS Backend SDK.
        // This varies depending on the SDK you're using
        // https://clerk.com/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart
        // Then use the `clerkClient()` to access the `getOrganization()` method
        const client = await clerkClient()
        const organization = await client.organizations.getOrganization({ organizationId: orgId })

        return <p>Hello {organization.name}</p>
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ## Protect content

  <Tabs items={['Client-side', 'Server-side']}>
    <Tab>
      You can protect content and even entire routes based on organization membership, roles, and permissions by performing [authorization checks](!authorization-check).

      In the following example, the page is protected from unauthenticated users, users that don't have the `org:admin` role, and users that are not in the `Acme Corp` organization.

      - The [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object is used to access the `isSignedIn` and `has()` properties.
      - The `isSignedIn` property is used to check if the user is signed in.
      - The `has()` helper is used to check if the user has the `org:admin` role.
      - The [`useOrganization()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-organization) hook is used to access the organization data.
      - The organization name is checked to ensure it matches the required organization name. If a user is not in the required organization, the page will display a message and the [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher) component will be rendered to allow the user to switch to the required organization.

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/protected/page.tsx' }}
      'use client'
      import { OrganizationSwitcher, useAuth, useOrganization } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function Page() {
        // The `useAuth()` hook gives you access to properties like `isSignedIn` and `has()`
        const { isSignedIn, has } = useAuth()
        const { organization } = useOrganization()

        // Check if the user is authenticated
        if (!isSignedIn) {
          return <p>You must be signed in to access this page.</p>
        }

        // Check if there is an active organization
        if (!organization) {
          return (
            <>
              <p>Set an active organization to access this page.</p>
              <OrganizationSwitcher />
            </>
          )
        }

        // Check if the user has the `org:admin` role
        if (!has({ role: 'org:admin' })) {
          return <p>You must be an admin to access this page.</p>
        }

        // Check if organization name matches (e.g., "Acme Corp")
        const requiredOrgName = 'Acme Corp'
        if (organization.name !== requiredOrgName) {
          return (
            <>
              <p>
                This page is only accessible in the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> organization.
                Switch to the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> organization to access this page.
              </p>
              <OrganizationSwitcher />
            </>
          )
        }

        return (
          <p>
            You are currently signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> in the{' '}
            <strong>{organization.name}</strong> organization.
          </p>
        )
      }
      ```

  ## It's time to build your B2B SaaS!

  You've added Clerk organizations to your Next.js app 🎉. Ready to scale to enterprise customers?

  - **Control access** with [custom roles and permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions): define granular permissions for different user types within organizations.

  - **Onboard entire companies** with [verified domains](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/verified-domains): automatically invite users with approved email domains (e.g., `@company.com`) to join organizations without manual invitations.

  - **Enable enterprise SSO** with [SAML and OIDC](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/sso): let customers authenticate through their identity provider (Okta, Entra ID, Google Workspace) with unlimited connections, no per-connection fees.
