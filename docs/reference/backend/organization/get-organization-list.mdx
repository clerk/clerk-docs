{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/api/endpoints/OrganizationApi.ts#L101 */}

Retrieves a list of Organizations. Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/reference/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) object with a `data` property that contains an array of [`Organization`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization) objects, and a `totalCount` property that indicates the total number of Organizations in the system.

```ts
function getOrganizationList(
  params: GetOrganizationListParams,
): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<Organization[]>>
```

## `GetOrganizationListParams`

<Properties>
  - `limit?`
  - `number`

  The number of results to return. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than 501. Can be used for paginating the results together with `offset`. Defaults to `10`.

  ---

  - `offset?`
  - `number`

  Skip the first `offset` results when paginating. Needs to be an integer greater or equal to zero. To be used in conjunction with `limit`. Defaults to `0`.

  ---

  - `includeMembersCount?`
  - `boolean`

  Whether the member counts of each Organization should be included in the response or not.

  ---

  - `query?`
  - `string`

  Filters Organizations with ID, name, or slug that match the given query. Uses exact match for Organization ID and partial match for name and slug.

  ---

  - `orderBy?`
  - `'name' | 'created_at' | 'members_count'`

  Return Organizations in a particular order. Prefix with a `-` to reverse the order. Prefix with a `+` to list in ascending order. Defaults to `'-created_at'`.
</Properties>

## Examples

### Basic

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList()
```

### Limit the number of results

Retrieves Organization list that is filtered by the number of results.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList({
  // returns the first 10 results
  limit: 10,
})
```

### Skip results

Retrieves Organization list that is filtered by the number of results to skip.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList({
  // skips the first 10 results
  offset: 10,
})
```

### Filter by query

Retrieves list of Organizations that match the query.

```tsx
// returns organizations that have 'test' in their name
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList({ query: 'test' })
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/organizations`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/organizations/get/organizations){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
