How to set up social connection with Discord

## Overview

Adding social connection with Discord to your app with Clerk is simple - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses  preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your Discord account.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Discord account and a  Discord OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions  using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/social-connections-oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/set-up-your-application).
- You need to have a Discord account. To create one, [click here](https://discord.com/register).

## Configuring Discord social connection

First, you need to register a new OAuth Discord app at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Set a name for your new application and click create. Now that your  application has been created, from the left side panel click on **OAuth2**, this is where you also need to add your **Redirect URL.** Go to the [Social Connections page](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=authentication/social) and enable Discord. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Paste the value into the **Redirect** input and save the changes.

Once all the above are complete, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret.** Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.
