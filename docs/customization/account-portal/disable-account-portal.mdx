> [!CAUTION]
> We recommend leaving the Account Portal enabled, even if you do choose to set up your own authentication flow. This helps with testing as well as providing an alternative path for users when needed.

To disable the Account Portal:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal).
1. In the navigation sidebar, select **Account Portal**.
1. Select the **Danger** tab.
1. Select **Disable account portal**. You will not be able to select this button until you have [set up an authentication flow for your users](#customizing-your-sign-upsign-in-flow), as applying this setting will immediately result in a 404 for all Account Portal pages.

## Customizing your sign-up/sign-in flow

If you would like to migrate away from the Account Portal and create your own sign-up/sign-in flow, Clerk provides a set of [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) that you can use, or you can opt to build [custom flows using Clerk's API](/docs/custom-flows/overview).
