Organization invitations allow you to add new members to your organization, granting them access to organization-specific features and resources. When you create an invitation, Clerk sends an email to the invited user with a unique invitation link.

When a user visits an organization invitation link, they will be redirected to Clerk's [Account Portal sign-in page](/docs/customization/account-portal/hosted-pages#sign-in). If the user is already signed in, they will be redirected to your application's homepage (`/`).

If you want to redirect the user to a specific page in your application, you can [specify a redirect URL when creating the invitation.](#redirect-url)

## Creating invitations

To create an organization invitation on the client-side, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/organizations/inviting-users). Note that this uses the [`organizations.inviteMember()`](/docs/references/javascript/organization/invitations#invite-member) method, which does not allow you to specify a `redirect_url`.

You can also create organization invitations via the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organization-Invitations#operation/CreateOrganizationInvitation){{ target: '_blank' }}.

You can either use a cURL command or Clerk's [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) to create an organization invitation. Use the following tabs to see examples for each method.

    The following example demonstrates how to create an organization invitation using cURL.

    <SignedIn>
      Replace the `<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID>` with the ID of the organization you want to invite the user to. Replace the `user_123` with the ID of the user who is inviting the other user. Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite. Your secret key is already injected into the code snippet.
    </SignedIn>

    <SignedOut>
      Replace the `<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID>` with the ID of the organization you want to invite the user to. Replace the `user_123` with the ID of the user who is inviting the other user. Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite. Replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your Clerk secret key. You can find your secret key in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    </SignedOut>

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    curl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/organizations/<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID>/invitations' \
    -X POST \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {{secret}}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{ "inviter_user_id": "user_123", "email_address": "test@gmail.com", "role": "org:member" }'
    ```
  </Tab>

    Clerk's [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) is a wrapper around the Backend API that makes it easier to interact with the API.

    To use the Backend SDK to create an invitation, see the [`createOrganizationInvitation()`](/docs/references/backend/organization/create-organization-invitation) reference documentation.

### Redirect URL

If you want to redirect the user to a specific page in your application, you can specify a `redirect_url` parameter when creating the invitation through the Backend API.

The following example demonstrates how to use cURL to create an invitation with the `redirect_url` set to `https://www.example.com/accept-invitation`:

```bash
curl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/organizations/<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID>/invitations' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {{secret}}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "inviter_user_id": "user_123", "email_address": "test@gmail.com", "role": "org:member", "redirect_url": "https://www.example.com/accept-invitation" }'
```

Once the user visits the invitation link and is redirected to the specified URL, the URL will contain two important query parameters added by Clerk: `__clerk_ticket` and `__clerk_status`.

The `__clerk_ticket` query parameter contains the ticket token, which is essential for completing the organization invitation flow. You'll use this token in your code for the page that you redirected the user to.

The `__clerk_status` query parameter is the outcome of the ticket verification and will contain one of three values:

- `sign_in` indicates the user already exists in your application. You should create a sign-in ticket in order to complete the flow.
- `sign_up` indicates the user doesn't already exist in your application. You should create a sign-up ticket in order to complete the flow.
- `complete` indicates the user already exists in your application, and was signed in. The flow has been completed and no further actions are required.

Using the previous example, the URL with the invitation token would look like this:

`https://www.example.com/accept-invitation?__clerk_ticket=.....`

> [!TIP]
> For creating invitations in a development environment, you can pass your Clerk Frontend API URL as the base URL. For example, your redirect URL could look like `https://prepared-phoenix-98.clerk.accounts.dev/sign-up`. You can find your Frontend API URL in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page. On the left side, select **Show API URLs**.

### Invitation metadata

You can also add metadata to an invitation when creating the invitation through the Backend API. Once the invited user signs up using the invitation link, the invitation metadata (`OrganizationInvitation.public_metadata`) will end up in the user's metadata (`User.public_metadata`). You can find more information about user metadata in the [metadata](/docs/users/metadata) docs.

To add metadata to an invitation, you can use the `public_metadata` property when the invitation is created.

The following example demonstrates how to create an invitation with metadata using cURL.

<SignedIn>
  Replace the `<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID>` with the ID of the organization you want to invite the user to. Replace the `user_123` with the ID of the user who is inviting the other user. Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite. Your secret key is already injected into the code snippet.
</SignedIn>

<SignedOut>
  Replace the `<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID>` with the ID of the organization you want to invite the user to. Replace the `user_123` with the ID of the user who is inviting the other user. Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite. Replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your Clerk secret key. You can find your secret key in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
</SignedOut>

```bash
curl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/organizations/<YOUR_ORGANIZATION_ID>/invitations' \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {{secret}}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "inviter_user_id": "user_123", "email_address": "test@gmail.com", "role": "org:member", "public_metadata": {"age": "21"} }'
```

## Revoking invitations

Revoking an invitation prevents the user from using the invitation link that was sent to them.

At the moment, you can only revoke invitations via the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organization-Invitations#operation/RevokeOrganizationInvitation){{ target: '_blank' }}.

You can either use a cURL command or Clerk's [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) to create an invitation. Use the following tabs to see examples for each method.

    <SignedOut>

## Custom flow

Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) and [Account Portal pages](/docs/customization/account-portal//overview) handle the sign-up flow for you, including the invitation flow. If you want to build a **custom** sign-up flow, see the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/invitations) guide.
