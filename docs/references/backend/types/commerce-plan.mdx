<Include src="_partials/billing/api-experimental" />

The `CommercePlan` object is similar to the [`CommercePlan`](/docs/references/javascript/types/commerce-plan-resource) object as it holds information about a plan, as well as methods for managing it. However, the `CommercePlan` object is different in that it is used in the [Backend API](TODO){{ target: '_blank' }} and is not directly accessible from the Frontend API.
