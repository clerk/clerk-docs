description: Use custom commands to sign in and out with Clerk in your Cypress tests.
---

The `@clerk/testing` package provides [Cypress custom commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands) to sign in and out with Clerk in your Cypress tests without having to interact with the UI.
To use these commands, you must import them in your [Cypress E2E support file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Support-file), as shown in the following example.

```ts {{ filename: 'cypress/support/e2e.ts' }}
/// <reference types="cypress" />
import { addClerkCommands } from '@clerk/testing/cypress'
addClerkCommands({ Cypress, cy })

export {}
```

### `cy.clerkSignIn`

The `cy.clerkSignIn` command is used to sign in a user using Clerk. This custom command supports only the following first factor strategies:

- Password
- Phone code
- Email code

Multi-factor authentication is not supported.

> [!NOTE]
> This helper internally uses the `setupClerkTestingToken()` helper, so you don't need to call it separately.

#### Prerequisites

- Before calling this command, you must call `cy.visit`.
- Before using this command, navigate to a non-protected page that loads Clerk.

#### Parameters

`cy.clerkSignIn` accepts an object with the following properties:

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'password' | 'phone_code' | 'email_code'`

  The sign-in strategy. Supported strategies are:

  - `password`: The command will sign in the user using the provided password and identifier.
  - `phone_code`: You must have a user with a test phone number as an identifier (e.g., `+15555550100`).
  - `email_code`: You must have a user with a test email as an identifier (e.g., `your_email+clerk_test@example.com`).

  ---

  - `identifier`
  - `string`

  The user's identifier. This could be a username, a phone number, or an email.

  ---

  - `password`
  - `string`

  The user's password. This is required only if the `strategy` is set to `'password'`.
</Properties>

  cy.clerkSignIn({ strategy: 'phone_code', identifier: '+15555550100' })
  cy.visit('/protected')
  // user is signed in from here on
})
```

  ---
