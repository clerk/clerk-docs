Authorization checks are checks you perform in your code to determine the access rights and privileges of a user, ensuring they have the necessary permissions to perform specific actions or access certain content. These checks are essential for protecting sensitive data, gating premium features, and ensuring users stay within their allowed scope of access.

Within organizations, authorization checks can be performed by checking a user's roles or custom permissions. Roles like `org:admin` determine a user's level of access within an organization, while custom permissions like `org:invoices:create` provide fine-grained control over specific features and actions.

## Examples

For examples on how to perform authorization checks, see the [guide on authorization checks](/docs/guides/secure/authorization-checks).
