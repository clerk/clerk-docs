How to set up social connection with Facebook

## Overview

Adding social connection with Facebook to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses  preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to create your own developer account with Facebook and generate your own **App ID** and **App Secret**.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you set up a Facebook developer account and a Facebook OAuth2.0 project - if you're looking for step-by-step  instructions using Clerk to add Social Connection (OAuth) to your  application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Facebook Developer account. To create one, consult the [Register as a Facebook developer](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/register) page.

## Configuring Facebook social connection

First, you need to create a new Facebook app and enable Facebook sign-in. Follow the official Facebook instructions on [how to create a Facebook app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app). When asked to choose an app type, make sure you select **Consumer**. To learn more about Facebook app types, check the [Facebook App Types](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/app-dashboard/app-types) page.

At the end of the app creation wizard, you will get redirected to the app dashboard. Find the **Facebook login** card and click **Set Up**. There's no need to go through the quickstart wizard - open the **Settings** dropdown menu (sidebar) and click **Basic**, as shown in the screenshot above.

Once you have a OAuth client ID created, click on the newly created ID under **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** and copy the **App Id** and **App Secret**.

In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)** and enable Facebook. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and paste the values you obtained during the previous step.

Before you close the modal, copy the **Authorized redirect URI**. Go back to the Facebook dashboard, open the **Facebook Login** menu (sidebar) and click **Settings**. Paste the URI you copied before into the **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** field. Hit **Save Changes**.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with Facebook is now configured for your instance.
