```ts {{ prettier: false }}

  id: string,
): Promise<DeletedObjectResource>
```

const waitlistId = 'waitlist_123'

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `DELETE/waitlist_entries/{waitlist_entry_id}`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/waitlist_entries/delete/waitlist_entries/\{waitlist_entry_id}){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
