# Locals

Through Astro [`locals`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/#storing-data-in-contextlocals), Clerk's [`Auth`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object) and current [`User`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/javascript/user/user) objects can be accessed between middlewares and pages. These locals are injected when you install the provided [middleware](/docs/references/astro/clerk-middleware).

The following guide provides examples of using the [`auth()`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth) local to validate an authenticated user and the [`currentUser()`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/current-user) local to access the [`Backend API User`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/backend/types/backend-user) object for the authenticated user.

## Protect your pages

You can use the `auth()` local to protect your pages and forms. It will return the current user's ID if they are signed in, or `null` if they are not. For more information on `auth()`, see the [reference](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth).

<CodeBlockTabs options={["Protect a page", "Protect a form"]}>
```astro filename="src/pages/protected.astro"
---
const { userId, redirectToSignIn } = Astro.locals.auth();

if (!userId) {
  return redirectToSignIn();
}
---

<div>Protected page</div>
```

```astro filename="src/pages/form.astro"
---
if (Astro.request.method === "POST") {
  if (!Astro.locals.auth().userId) {
    throw new Error('You must be signed in to add an item to your cart');
  }

  const data = await Astro.request.formData();
  console.log('add item action', data);
}
---

<form method="POST">
  <input
    value="test"
    type="text"
    name="name"
  />
  <button type="submit">Add to Cart</button>
</form>
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Accessing the current user

Current user data is important for data enrichment. You can use the `currentUser()` local to fetch the current user's data in your pages.

Under the hood, this local:
- uses the `GET /v1/users/me` endpoint.
- counts towards the [Backend API Request Rate Limit](/docs/backend-requests/resources/rate-limits#rate-limits).

For more information on `currentUser()`, see the [reference](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/current-user).

```astro filename="src/pages/form.astro"
---
if (Astro.request.method === "POST") {
  const user = await Astro.locals.currentUser();

  if (!user) {
    throw new Error('You must be signed in to use this feature');
  }

  const data = await Astro.request.formData();
  const serverData = {
    usersHobby: data.get("hobby"),
    userId: user.id,
    profileImage: user.imageUrl
  };

  console.log('add item action completed with user details ', serverData);
}
---

<form method="POST">
  <input
    value="soccer"
    type="text"
    name="hobby"
  />
  <button type="submit">Submit your hobby</button>
</form>
```
