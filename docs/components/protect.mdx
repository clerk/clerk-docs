# `<Protect />`

The `<Protect />` component is used for authorization. It only renders its children when the current user has the specified [permission](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions) or role in the organization.

## Usage

You can pass either a `permission` or `role` key to `<Protect />` to limit who can see the content it renders. If you do not pass either prop, `<Protect />` behaves the same as [`<SignedIn />`](/docs/components/control/signed-in) and will render its children if the user is signed in, regardless of their Role or its Permissions.

For more complex authorization logic, pass conditional logic to the `condition` prop.

### Render content by Permissions

The children of the following component will only be visible to users with Roles that have the `org:posts:create` permission.

<Tabs type="framework" items={["Next.js", "React"]}>
    <Tab>
        ```jsx
        import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

        export default function ProtectPage() {
            return (
                <Protect
                    permission="org:posts:create"
                    fallback={<p>You do not have the permissions to create a post.</p>}
                >
                    {children}
                </Protect>
            );
        }
        ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
        ```jsx
        import { Protect } from "@clerk/react";

        export default function ProtectPage() {
            return (
                <Protect
                    permission="org:posts:create"
                    fallback={<p>You do not have the permissions to create a post.</p>}
                >
                    {children}
                </Protect>
            );
        }
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Render content by Role

<Callout type="warning">
    `<Protect/>` allows a role key to be passed for convenience, it is recommended to check against permissions instead.
</Callout>

The children of the following component will only be visible to users with the `org:editor` Role.

<Tabs type="framework" items={["Next.js", "React"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```jsx
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          role="org:editor"
          fallback={<p>Only an admin can access this content.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```jsx
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/react";

    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          role="org:editor"
          fallback={<p>Only an admin can access this content.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
