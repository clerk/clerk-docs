title: '`SessionWithActivities`'
description: The SessionWithActivities object is a modified Session object. It contains most of the information that the Session object stores, adding extra information about the current session's latest activity.
---

The `SessionWithActivities` object is a modified [`Session`](/docs/references/javascript/session) object. It includes most of the information stored in the `Session` object, with additional details about the latest activity in the current session. `SessionWithActivities` is returned by the [`User.getSessions()`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user#get-sessions) method.

The additional data included in the latest activity are useful for analytics purposes. A [`SessionActivity`](#session-activity) object will provide information about the user's location, device and browser.

While the `SessionWithActivities` object wraps the most important information around a `Session` object, the two objects have entirely different methods.
