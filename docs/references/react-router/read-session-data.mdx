title: Read session and user data in your React Router app with Clerk
description: Learn how to use Clerk's hooks and helpers to access the active session and user data in your React Router application.
---

Clerk provides a set of [hooks and helpers](/docs/references/react-router/overview#client-side-helpers) that you can use to access the active session and user data in your React Router application. Here are examples of how to use these helpers in both the client and server-side to get you started.

## Server-side

To access active session and user data on the server-side, use the `getAuth()` helper. See the [reference documentation](/docs/references/react-router/get-auth) for more information, including code examples.

## Client-side

To access active session and user data on the client-side, use Clerk's `useAuth()` and `useUser()` hooks.

### `useAuth()`

The [`useAuth()`](/docs/references/react/use-auth){{ target: '_blank' }} hook provides information about the current auth state, as well as helper methods to manage the current active session. The hook returns `userId`, which can be used to protect your routes.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/use-auth.tsx' }}
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/react-router'

export default function Page() {
  const { isLoaded, userId } = useAuth()

  // Return null if the user signs out while on the page
  // or if the auth state is still loading
  if (!isLoaded || !userId) {
    return null
  }

  return <div>Hello, {userId}!</div>
}
```

### `useUser()`

The [`useUser()`](/docs/references/react/use-user){{ target: '_blank' }} hook provides the current user's [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user){{ target: '_blank' }} object, which holds all of the information for a user of your application and provides a set of methods to manage their account.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/use-user.tsx' }}
import { useUser } from '@clerk/react-router'

export default function Page() {
  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser()

  // Return null if the user signs out while on the page
  // or if the auth state is still loading
  if (!isLoaded || !isSignedIn) {
    return null
  }

  return <div>Hello, {user.firstName}!</div>
}
```
