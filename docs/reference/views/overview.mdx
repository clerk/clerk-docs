Clerk offers a comprehensive suite of views designed to seamlessly integrate authentication and multi-tenancy into your application. With Clerk views, you can easily customize the appearance of authentication views and pages, manage the entire authentication flow to suit your specific needs, and even build robust SaaS applications.

## Clerk views

- [`AuthView`](/docs/reference/views/authentication/auth-view) - Renders a full authentication interface, supporting multiple sign-up and sign-in methods, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and password recovery flows.
- [`UserButton`](/docs/reference/views/user/user-button) - Displays the signed-in user's profile image.
- [`UserProfileView`](/docs/reference/views/user/user-profile-view) - Renders a complete user profile interface with personal information, security settings, account switching, and sign-out options.

  ## Installation

  The Clerk Android SDK is now split into two packages:

  - `com.clerk:clerk-android-api` - The core Clerk SDK for authentication and user management.
  - `com.clerk:clerk-android-ui` - The Clerk UI components for authentication and user management.

  The `com.clerk:clerk-android-ui` pulls the `com.clerk:clerk-android-api` package as a dependency, so you only need to add the `com.clerk:clerk-android-ui` package to your dependencies if you're using Clerk's UI components.

  ```gradle
  dependencies {
      // Only if you're using the Clerk API without the Clerk UI components
      implementation("com.clerk:clerk-android-api:<latest-version>")
      
      implementation("com.clerk:clerk-android-ui:<latest-version>")
  }
  ```

  You can find the latest version of the Clerk Android SDK on the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-android/releases).

1. Under **Branding**, toggle on the **Remove "Secured by Clerk" branding** option.
