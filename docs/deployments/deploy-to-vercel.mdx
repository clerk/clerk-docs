# Deploying a Clerk app to Vercel

> [!WARNING]
> This guide assumes that you have already [set up a Clerk application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) that you're ready to deploy. If you haven't yet, be sure to [check out our guide to creating a new Clerk app](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).

Deploying a Clerk app to a Vercel project enables you to rapidly develop your applications and deploy them to production with ease.

If you haven't set up your Clerk application in Vercel yet, [set up a new Vercel project](#set-up-a-new-vercel-project).

If you already have a Vercel project for your application and need to integrate Clerk, [add Clerk API keys to an existing Vercel project](#add-clerk-api-keys-to-existing-vercel-project).

## Set up a new Vercel project

1. To set up a new Vercel project, start by going to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard). Here, you'll see a list of your projects or, if you don't have any projects yet, a prompt to create a new project.
1. Create a new project by pressing the **Add New** button in the top right corner of the screen or by [pressing this link](https://vercel.com/new). You'll be redirected to a page where you can import a Git repository.
1. Find the Git repository you want to use and press **Import**. You'll be redirected to the **Configure Project** page.
1. Fill out the necessary information. And most importantly, ensure to add your Clerk API keys to the **[Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables)**. You can find your Clerk API keys by navigating to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) and in the navigation sidebar, selecting **API Keys**.

> [!WARNING]
> If you would like to deploy to production, you will need to add your **production** API keys to your Vercel project. Refer to the [Deploy to production](/docs/deployments/overview) guide for more information.

## Add Clerk API keys to existing Vercel project

1. To add your Clerk API keys to an existing Vercel project, start by selecting your project from your [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
1. Select **Settings** in the navigation bar at the top.
1. In the sidebar, select **Environment Variables** and add your Clerk API keys. You can find your Clerk API keys by navigating to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) and in the navigation sidebar, selecting **API Keys**.
1. When adding **Environment Variables**, you can select which keys associate with which Vercel deployment environments. Using this, you can have your production Vercel environment use your production Clerk API keys while having your preview and development Vercel deployments use your development Clerk API keys.

> [!WARNING]
> If you would like to deploy to production, you will need to add your **production** API keys to your Vercel project. Refer to the [Deploy to production](/docs/deployments/overview) guide for more information.

## Vercel previews

### For development environments

[Vercel provides a method for easily deploying preview URLs for development environments, like GitHub PRs.](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/generated-urls)

An example of this preview functionality might look something like this:

![A comment on a GitHub pull request from the Vercel bot showing a preview link of your project](/docs/images/deployments/vercel-github-comment.png)

If you're using your development instance Clerk API keys for Vercel preview deployments, everything will work out-of-the-box.

> We use Clerk magic to automatically detect the domain you're hosting from and handle redirects for you! âœ¨

### For production environments

If you want to use your production instance Clerk API keys for Vercel preview deployments, you'll need to utilize [Vercel's Preview Deployment Suffix feature](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/generated-urls#preview-deployment-suffix) to host your preview deployments on a separate domain.

This is done to ensure your users' security by restricting production redirects to fall under your production domain. This prevents bad actors from maliciously requesting sign-in access to their own domains.

See [the docs on preview environments](/docs/deployments/set-up-preview-environment) to learn more.

> We take security very seriously at Clerk. To learn more about how Clerk ensures your user's security, [please refer to our docs on the subject.](/docs/security/overview)
