# Custom Redirects


With the Account Portal, we rely on the `redirect_url` query param passed from your application to redirect users after they Sign In or Sign Up. This gives you the ability to dynamically generate redirects based on context.

For externally-initiated situations such as User Impersonation or SAML where the context is not available and the query param has not been defined, Clerk defaults to your application homepage as a fallback. 

If you prefer a different fallback path, you can specify the following paths via the 'redirects' tab under Account Portal in your Clerk dashboard:

- **After sign-up fallback**: Fallback path to redirect users to after a successful sign up.
- **After sign-in fallback**: Fallback path to redirect users to after a successful sign in.
- **Logo Click**: If you have uploaded a logo, specify where to take users if they click on it.
