  - Use HubSpot to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with HubSpot allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their HubSpot account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **HubSpot**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials, which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your HubSpot Developer account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [HubSpot developer account](https://app.hubspot.com/signup-hubspot/developers).

  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **HubSpot**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.

  1. In the **Redirect URLs** section, paste the **Redirect URI** value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. In the **Scopes** section, select **Add new scope**.
  1. Enable the **crm.objects.owners.read** scope and select **Update**.
  1. Select **Create app**. You'll be redirected back to the **App Info** tab.
  1. Select the **Auth** tab.
  1. Save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values somewhere secure.
