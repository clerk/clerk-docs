# Rate limits

Clerk rate limits certain endpoints to help protect users against brute-force attacks or to stop abuse of Clerk's platform.

Rate limiting is based on IP addresses.

## Errors

If you receive a `429` error code, your IP address has been rate limited. All subsequent requests to that specific endpoint coming from your IP address will be blocked for a given amount of time.

Requests that have been rate limited will receive the `Retry-After` response header, which contains the number of seconds after which the block expires.

## Frontend API requests

Frontend API requests are rate limited per user.

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Create SignIn | `/v1/sign_ins` | 7 requests per 10 seconds |
| Create SignUp | `/v1/sign_ups` | 7 requests per 10 seconds |
| Attempt SignIn | `/v1/sign_ins/attempt_(first\|second)_factor` | 3 requests per 10 seconds |
| Attempt SignUp | `/v1/sign_ups/attempt_verification` | 3 requests per 10 seconds |

## Backend API requests

Backend API requests are rate limited per application instance.

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| Create users | `POST /v1/users` | 20 requests per 10 seconds |
| All other endpoints | | 100 requests per 10 seconds |
| Get the JWKS of the instance | `GET /v1/jwks` | No rate limit |

> [!NOTE]
> The `currentUser()` helper uses the `GET /v1/users/me` endpoint, so it is subject to the 100 requests per 10 seconds rate limit.
