<Steps>
  ## Install `@clerk/nuxt`

  The [Clerk Nuxt SDK](/docs/reference/nuxt/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, Vue composables, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  ```npm
  npm install @clerk/nuxt
  ```

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in your Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
    1. Paste your key into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  NUXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  NUXT_CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ## Configure `nuxt.config.ts`

  To enable Clerk in your Nuxt app, add `@clerk/nuxt` to your modules array in `nuxt.config.ts`. This automatically configures Clerk's middleware and plugins and imports Clerk's components.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'nuxt.config.ts', mark: [2] }}
  export default defineNuxtConfig({
    modules: ['@clerk/nuxt'],
  })
  ```

  ## Create a header with Clerk components

  Nuxt 3 automatically imports and makes all components in the `components/` directory globally available without requiring explicit imports. See the [Nuxt docs](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/auto-imports) for details.

  You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/reference/components/overview#control-components).

  The following example creates a header using the following components:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/reference/components/user/user-button): Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/reference/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page or displays the sign-in modal. In this example, since no props or [environment variables](/docs/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables) are set for the sign-in URL, this component links to the [Account Portal sign-in page](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/account-portal#sign-in).

  ```vue {{ filename: 'app/app.vue', mark: [2, [6, 13]] }}
  <script setup lang="ts">
  // Components are automatically imported
  </script>

  <template>
    <header>
      <SignedOut>
        <SignInButton />
      </SignedOut>
      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton />
      </SignedIn>
    </header>

    <main>
      <NuxtPage />
    </main>
  </template>
  ```

  ## Create your first user

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit your app's homepage at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000). Sign up to create your first user.
