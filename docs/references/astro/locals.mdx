# Locals

Through Astro [`locals`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/#storing-data-in-contextlocals), the [`Auth`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object) and current user objects can be accessed between middlewares and pages. These locals are injected when you install the provided [middleware](/docs/references/astro/clerk-middleware).

The following guide provides examples of using the `auth()` local to validate an authenticated user and the `currentUser()` local to access the `Backend API User` object for the authenticated user.

## Protect your pages

You can use the `auth()` local to protect your pages. This local will return the current user's ID if they are signed in, or `null` if they are not.

```astro filename="src/pages/protected.astro"
---
if (!Astro.locals.auth().userId) {
  return Astro.redirect('/login');
}
---

<div>Protected page</div>
```

## Protect your forms

```astro filename="src/pages/form.astro"
---
if (Astro.request.method === "POST") {
  if (!Astro.locals.auth().userId) {
    throw new Error('You must be signed in to add an item to your cart');
  }

  const data = await Astro.request.formData();
  console.log('add item action', data);
}
---

<form method="POST">
  <input
    value="test"
    type="text"
    name="name"
  />
  <button type="submit">Add to Cart</button>
</form>
```

## Accessing the current user

Current user data is important for data enrichment. You can use the `currentUser()` local to fetch the current user's data in your pages.

```astro filename="src/pages/form.astro"
---
if (Astro.request.method === "POST") {
  const user = await Astro.locals.currentUser();

  if (!user) {
    throw new Error('You must be signed in to use this feature');
  }

  const data = await Astro.request.formData();
  const serverData = {
    usersHobby: data.get("hobby"),
    userId: user.id,
    profileImage: user.imageUrl
  };

  console.log('add item action completed with user details ', serverData);
}
---

<form method="POST">
  <input
    value="soccer"
    type="text"
    name="hobby"
  />
  <button type="submit">Submit your hobby</button>
</form>
```
