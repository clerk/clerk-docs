# `$organizationStore`

The `$organizationStore` store is used to retrieve attributes of the currently active organization.

## How to use the `$organizationStore` store

The following example demonstrates how to use the `$organizationStore` store to access the [`Organization`](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) object, which allows you to access the current active organization.

```tsx filename="session.tsx"
import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react';
import { $organizationStore } from '@clerk/astro/client';

export default function Home() {
  const organization = useStore($organizationStore);

  if (organization === undefined) {
    // Add logic to handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  if(organization === null) {
    // Add logic to handle no active organization state
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>This current organization is {organization.name}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
