# The Backend `Session` object

The Backend `Session` object is similar to the [`Session`](/docs/references/javascript/session) object as it is an abstraction over an HTTP session and models the period of information exchange between a user and the server. However, the Backend `Session` object is different as it is used in the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Sessions#operation/GetSessionList) and is not directly accessible from the Frontend API.
