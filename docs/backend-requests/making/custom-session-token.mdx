# Customize your session token

Session tokens are JWTs generated by Clerk on behalf of your instance, and convey an authenticated user session to your backend.

They typically contain a standard set of claims that are required for Clerk to function. However, you can customize them and retrieve the data at any point.

Clerk has default claims that will be included in this session token. You can read about [Clerk's session tokens](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens) and it's default claims.

<Callout type="danger">
The entire session token has a max size of 4kb. Exceeding this size can have adverse effects, including a possible infinite redirect loop for users who exceed this size on Next applications.
</Callout>

## How to Customize your session token?

<Steps>

### Go to **Sessions** in the Clerk Dashboard

In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the **[Sessions](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=sessions)** page.

### Add a new claim to the session token

In the modal that opens, you can add any claim to your session token that you need. This examples adds a new claim called `fullName` and `primaryEmail` to the session token.

### Using the custom claims in your application

Now that you have added the custom claims to your session token, you can use them in your application. Below is an example of how you can use the [`getAuth`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) helper to access the custom claims in your application.

#### Using `getAuth` in your Next.js application

<CodeBlockTabs type="router" options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
```tsx filename="app/page.[jsx/tsx]"
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
 
export default function Page() {
  const { sessionClaims } = auth();

  const firstName = sessionClaims?.fullName;

  const primaryEmail = sessionClaims?.primaryEmail;

  return NextResponse.json({ firstName, primaryEmail })
}
```

```tsx filename="pages/api/example.[ts/js]"
import { getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const { sessionClaims } = getAuth(req);

  const firstName = sessionClaims.fullName;

  const primaryEmail = sessionClaims.primaryEmail;

  return res.status(200).json({ firstName, primaryEmail })
}
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Add global TypeScript type for additional session claims

A global type for additional session claims defined in a declaration file avoids type errors and provides auto-completion.

```tsx filename="types/globals.d.ts"
export { };

declare global {
  interface CustomJwtSessionClaims {
    firstName?: string;
    primaryEmail?: string;
  }
}
```

</Steps>
