Clerk provides a set of [hooks and helpers](/docs/reference/nextjs/overview#client-side-helpers) that you can use to protect content and read user data in your Next.js application. Here are examples of how to use these helpers in both the client and server-side to get you started.

## Server-side

### App Router

[`auth()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth) and [`currentUser()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/current-user) are App Router-specific helpers that you can use inside of your Route Handlers, Middleware, Server Components, and Server Actions.

- The `auth()` helper will return the [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object of the currently active user.
- The `currentUser()` helper will return the [`Backend User`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-user) object of the currently active user, which includes helpful information like the user's name or email address. **It does count towards the [Backend API request rate limit](/docs/guides/how-clerk-works/system-limits)** so it's recommended to use the [`useUser()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-user) hook on the client side when possible and only use `currentUser()` when you specifically need user data in a server context. For more information on this helper, see the [`currentUser()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/current-user) reference.

The following example uses the [`auth()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth) helper to validate an authenticated user and the `currentUser()` helper to access the `Backend User` object for the authenticated user.

> [!TIP]
> Any requests from a Client Component to a Route Handler will read the session from cookies and will not need the token sent as a Bearer token.

<Tabs items={["Server components and actions", "Route Handler"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
    import { auth, currentUser } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default async function Page() {
      // Use `auth()` to access `isAuthenticated` - if false, the user is not signed in
      const { isAuthenticated } = await auth()

      // Protect the route by checking if the user is signed in
      if (!isAuthenticated) {
        return <div>Sign in to view this page</div>
      }

      // Get the Backend User object when you need access to the user's information
      const user = await currentUser()

      // Use `user` to render user details or create UI elements
      return <div>Welcome, {user.firstName}!</div>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    > [!WARNING]
    > The [`Backend User`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-user) object includes a `privateMetadata` field that should not be exposed to the frontend. Avoid passing the full user object returned by `currentUser()` to the frontend. Instead, pass only the specified fields you need.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/api/user/route.ts' }}
    import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
    import { currentUser, auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export async function GET() {
      // Use `auth()` to access `isAuthenticated` - if false, the user is not signed in
      const { isAuthenticated } = await auth()

      // Protect the route by checking if the user is signed in
      if (!isAuthenticated) {
        return new NextResponse('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })
      }

      // Use `currentUser()` to get the Backend User object
      const user = await currentUser()

      // Add your Route Handler's logic with the returned `user` object

      return NextResponse.json(
        { userId: user.id, email: user.emailAddresses[0].emailAddress },
        { status: 200 },
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Pages Router

For Next.js applications using the Pages Router, the [`getAuth()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/pages-router/get-auth) helper will return the [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object of the currently active user, which contains important information like the current user's session ID, user ID, and Organization ID, as well as the `isAuthenticated` property which can be used to protect your API routes.

In some cases, you may need the full [`Backend User`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-user) object of the currently active user. This is helpful if you want to render information, like their first and last name, directly from the server.

The `clerkClient()` helper returns an instance of the [JS Backend SDK](/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart), which exposes Clerk's Backend API resources through methods such as the [`getUser()`](/docs/reference/backend/user/get-user){{ target: '_blank' }} method. This method returns the full `Backend User` object. **It does count towards the [Backend API request rate limit](/docs/guides/how-clerk-works/system-limits)** so it's recommended to use the [`useUser()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-user) hook on the client side when possible and only use `getUser()` when you specifically need user data in a server context.

In the following example, the `userId` is passed to the JS Backend SDK's `getUser()` method to get the user's full `Backend User` object.
