title: Read session and user data in your Nuxt app with Clerk
description: Learn how to use Clerk's composables to access the active session and user data in your Nuxt application.
---

Clerk provides [composables](/docs/references/nuxt/overview#client-side-helpers) to access the session and user data in your Nuxt application.

## Client-side

### `useAuth()`

<Include src="_partials/nuxt/use-auth" />

## `useUser()`

The `useUser()` composable provides access to the current user's [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user) object, which holds all of the data for a user of your application and provides a set of methods to manage their account.

In the following example, the `isLoaded` property checks if Clerk has finished initializing and the `isSignedIn` property checks if a user is currently signed in.

```vue {{ filename: 'pages/protected-page.vue' }}
<script setup>
const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser()
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">Loading...</div>
  <div v-else-if="!isSignedIn">Sign in to access this page</div>
  <div v-else>Hello, {{ user.firstName }}!</div>
</template>
```

## Server-side

### `clerkClient()`

The `clerkClient()` helper returns an instance of the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview).

In the following example, the [`auth`](/docs/references/nuxt/overview#auth-object) object is used to get the `userId` to check if the user is signed in. The `clerkClient()` helper retrieves the full [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user) object.

```ts {{ filename: 'server/api/auth/index.ts' }}
import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const { userId } = event.context.auth

  // Check if the user is signed in
  if (!userId) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 401,
      statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: No user ID provided',
    })
  }

  // Retrieve the user data
  const user = await clerkClient(event).users.getUser(userId)
  return user
})
```
