# `getUserList(params?: UserListParams)`

Retrieves user list:

```tsx
const users = await clerkClient.users.getUserList();
```

Retrieves user list that is ordered and filtered by the number of results. More params can be found at the UserListParams definition.

```tsx
const sessions = await clerkClient.users.getUserList({
  orderBy: '-created_at',
  limit: 10,
});
```

Retrieves user list that is filtered by the given email addresses and phone numbers:

```tsx
const emailAddress = ['email1@clerk.dev', 'email2@clerk.dev'];

const phoneNumber = ['+12025550108'];

// If these filters are included, the response will contain only users that own any of these emails and/or phone numbers.
const sessions = await clerkClient.users.getUserList({ emailAddress, phoneNumber });
```

To do a broader match through a list of fields, you can use the query parameter which partially matches the fields: userId, emailAddress, phoneNumber, username, web3Wallet, firstName and lastName.

```tsx
// Matches users with the string `test` matched in multiple user attributes.
const usersMatchingTest = await clerkClient.users.getUserList({
  query: 'test',
});
```
