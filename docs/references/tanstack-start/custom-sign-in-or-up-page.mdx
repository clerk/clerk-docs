title: Build your own sign-in-or-up page for your TanStack Start app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add a custom sign-in-or-up page to your TanStack Start app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component with the [Tanstack Router catch-all route](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/code-based-routing#splat--catch-all-routes) in order to build a custom page for your TanStack Start app that allows users to sign-in or sign-up within a single flow.

If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-in-or-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component to allow users to both sign-in or sign-up from a single flow.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-in.$.tsx' }}
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/tanstack-start'
  import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/sign-in/$')({
    component: Page,
  })

  function Page() {
    return <SignIn />
  }
  ```

  ## Configure your sign-in-or-up page

  To tell Clerk where to find your sign-in-or-up page, set the following [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects):

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
  ```

  ## Visit your new page

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-in](http://localhost:3000/sign-in).
