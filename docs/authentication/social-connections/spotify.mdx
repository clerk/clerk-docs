Learn how to set up a social connection with Spotify in your Clerk application.
	
Clerk does not currently support preconfigured shared OAuth credentials for Spotify on development instances. You will have to provide custom credentials for both development *and* production instances, which includes generating your own Client ID and Client Secret using your Spotify Developer account. Don't worry, this guide will walk you through that process in just a few simple steps.

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Spotify developer account. To create one, [click here](https://developer.spotify.com/).

## Configuration

<Steps>
	
### Create a Spotify application

To create a new OAuth Spotify app, go to the [Spotify Developer portal](https://developer.spotify.com/) and log in. Once logged in, navigate to the [Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). Click on either of the **Create app** buttons.

Once redirected to the application creation form, you need to set an **App name**, **App description**, and **Redirect URI**. **Website** is optional.

### Spotify + your Clerk app
	
You can retrieve the **Redirect URI** from the Clerk Dashboard. But first, you need to enable Spotify as a social connection for your Clerk application. 
	
Navigate to the [Social Connections page](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections) in your Clerk Dashboard. Toggle on the Spotify option. 
	
In the modal that opened, copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Keep this modal and page open.
	
### Configure Spotify application

Navigate back to your Spotify app and paste the **Authorized redirect URI** you copied from the Clerk Dashboard into the **Redirect URIs** input. 

Agree to Spotify's terms and conditions and click **Save**.

Once your Spotify app is created, you'll be redirected to the app dashboard. From there, navigate to **Settings**.

Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Go back to the Clerk Dashboard, where the modal should still be open, and paste these values into the respective fields. 

<Callout type="info">
  If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard and click on the settings cog icon next to the Spotify option. You can now paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.
