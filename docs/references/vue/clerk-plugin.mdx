The `clerkPlugin` is required to integrate Clerk into your Vue application, providing session and user context to Clerk's composables and components.

## Usage

To configure Clerk with Vue, you must initialize `clerkPlugin`. It's required to pass your Clerk Publishable Key as an option. You can add an `if` statement to check that the key is imported properly. This prevents the app from running without the Publishable Key and catches TypeScript errors.

The `clerkPlugin` accepts optional options, such as `{ signInForceRedirectUrl: '/dashboard' }`. See the [properties section](#properties) for more information.

```ts {{ filename: 'src/main.ts' }}
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import { clerkPlugin } from '@clerk/vue'

const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
  throw new Error('Add your Clerk Publishable Key to the .env.local file')
}

const app = createApp(App)
// clerkPlugin requires your Clerk Publishable Key
// It can accept other options, such as { signInForceRedirectUrl: '/dashboard' }
app.use(clerkPlugin, { publishableKey: PUBLISHABLE_KEY })
app.mount('#app')
```
