# Organizations

Organizations are a way of grouping your application's users. Organizations are shared accounts, useful for project and team leaders—think of GitHub Teams or the different departments of a company. Members of different organizations can usually collaborate across shared resources but might have different levels of access and permissions with different [role](/docs/organizations/overview#roles).

To enable organizations, go to the Clerk Dashboard and navigate to [**Organizations Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings). Select the toggle next to **Enable Organizations**.

There is no limit to the number of organizations a user can be a member of. However, a user can only create up to 100 organizations in a given application instance. All members of an organization can view information about other members in the same organization.

Clerk provides [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview), [React hooks](/docs/references/react/use-organization), and [APIs](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) to help you integrate organizations into your application. Using the [Organizations Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organizations), you can provide additional [private and public metadata for the organization](/docs/organizations/metadata) and set custom attributes.

Roles determine a user's level of access and permissions within an organization. [Learn more about how roles and permissions work and how to create your own with Clerk.](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions).
