These are all methods on [the Clerk class](/docs/references/javascript/clerk) that help you handle navigation callbacks from Clerk, usually in conjunction with [redirect methods](/docs/references/javascript/clerk) or [built URLs](/docs/references/javascript/clerk).

## `handleEmailLinkVerification()`

Handles the completion of an email link verification flow by processing the verification status and session information from the URL parameters after a user visits an email verification link.

```typescript
function handleEmailLinkVerification(
  params: handleEmailLinkVerificationParams,
  customNavigate?: ((to: string) => Promise<unknown>) | undefined,
): Promise<unknown>
```

When a user visits an email verification link, they get redirected to the URL that was provided when the email link verification flow was initialized, such as calling `startEmailLinkFlow({ redirectUrl: string })`.

The URL will include the following query parameters: `__clerk_status` and `__clerk_created_session`.

The `__clerk_status` query parameter is the outcome of the verification and accepts the following values: `expired`, `failed`, `loading`, `verified`, `verified_switch_tab`, or `client_mismatch`. `client_mismatch` can only be a verification outcome if the [**Require the same device or browser**](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#require-the-same-device-or-browser) setting is enabled in the Clerk Dashboard.

The `__clerk_created_session` query parameter will hold the ID of the new session, if one was created as a result of the verification. Since the email link can be opened at any device and not the one that originated the verification, the new session ID might not be available under [`Client.sessions`](/docs/references/javascript/client#properties).

The `handleEmailLinkVerification()` method takes care of finalizing the email link flow, depending on the verification outcome. If the email link verification wasn't successful, this method will throw an [`EmailLinkError`](/docs/custom-flows/email-links). You can check the error's `code` property to investigate the cause of the error.

### Parameters

`handleEmailLinkVerification()` accepts the following parameters:

<Properties>
  - `params`
  - [`handleEmailLinkVerificationParams`](#handle-email-link-verification-params)

  Allows you to define the URLs where the user should be redirected to on successful verification or pending/completed sign-up or sign-in attempts. If the email link is successfully verified on another device, there's a callback function parameter that allows custom code execution.

  ---

  - `customNavigate?`
  - `(to: string) => Promise<unknown>`

  A function that overrides Clerk's default navigation behavior, allowing custom handling of navigation during sign-up and sign-in flows.
</Properties>

### `handleEmailLinkVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `redirectUrlComplete?`
  - `string | undefined`

  The full URL to navigate to after successful email link verification on completed sign-up or sign-in on the same device.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl?`
  - `string | undefined`

  The full URL to navigate to after successful email link verification on the same device, but without completing sign-in or sign-up.

  ---

  - `onVerifiedOnOtherDevice?`
  - `() => void`

  Callback function to be executed after successful email link verification on another device.
</Properties>

## `handleRedirectCallback()`

Completes a custom OAuth flow started by calling either [`SignIn.authenticateWithRedirect(params)`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in) or [`SignUp.authenticateWithRedirect(params)`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up).

```typescript
function handleRedirectCallback(
  params: HandleOAuthCallbackParams,
  customNavigate?: ((to: string) => Promise<unknown>) | undefined,
): Promise<unknown>
```

### Parameters

<Properties>
  - `params`
  - [`HandleOAuthCallbackParams`](#handle-o-auth-callback-params)

  Additional props that define where the user will be redirected to at the end of a successful OAuth flow.

  ---

  - `customNavigate`
  - `(to: string) => Promise<unknown>`

  A function that overrides Clerk's default navigation behavior, allowing custom handling of navigation during sign-up and sign-in flows.
</Properties>

### `HandleOAuthCallbackParams`

<Properties>
  - `signInUrl?`
  - `string`

  Full URL or path where the SignIn component is mounted.

  ---

  - `signUpUrl?`
  - `string`

  Full URL or path where the SignUp component is mounted.

  ---

  - `signInFallbackRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The fallback URL to redirect to after the user signs in, if there's no `redirect_url` in the path already. Defaults to `/`. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.

  ---

  - `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The fallback URL to redirect to after the user signs up, if there's no `redirect_url` in the path already. Defaults to `/`. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.

  ---

  - `signInForceRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  If provided, this URL will always be redirected to after the user signs in. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.

  ---

  - `signUpForceRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  If provided, this URL will always be redirected to after the user signs up. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.

  ---

  - `firstFactorUrl`
  - `string | undefined`

  Full URL or path to navigate during sign in, if identifier verification is required.

  ---

  - `secondFactorUrl`
  - `string | undefined`

  Full URL or path to navigate during sign in, if 2FA is enabled.

  ---

  - `resetPasswordUrl`
  - `string`

  Full URL or path to navigate during sign in, if the user is required to reset their password.

  ---

  - `continueSignUpUrl`
  - `string | undefined | null`

  Full URL or path to navigate after an incomplete sign up.

  ---

  - `string | undefined | null`

  Full URL or path to navigate after requesting email verification.

  ---

  - `verifyPhoneNumberUrl`
  - `string | undefined | null`

  Full URL or path to navigate after requesting phone verification.

  ---

  - `transferable?`
  - `boolean`

  Indicates whether or not sign in attempts are transferable to the sign up flow. Defaults to `true`. When set to `false`, prevents opaque sign ups when a user attempts to sign in via OAuth with an email that doesn't exist. See [OAuth account transfer flows](/docs/custom-flows/oauth-connections#o-auth-account-transfer-flows) for more information.
</Properties>

## `handleUnauthenticated()`

Handles a 401 response from [Frontend API](/docs/reference/frontend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} by refreshing the client and session object accordingly.

```typescript
function handleUnauthenticated(opts?: { broadcast: boolean }): Promise<unknown>
```
