description: Use Clerk in your Android app with global access and reactive state flows.
sdk: android
---

`Clerk` is the main entry point for the SDK. Initialize it once at app startup, then access authentication state through reactive flows.

## Initialize Clerk

Initialize Clerk in your `Application` class before using any Clerk features:

<Include src="_partials/android/initialize-clerk" />

Register your Application class in `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application android:name=".MyClerkApp">
    ...
</application>
```

## Listen for initialization

The Clerk SDK initialization is non-blocking. Listen for the SDK to emit a success from `Clerk.isInitialized` to know when it's ready to use:

```kotlin
import com.clerk.api.Clerk
import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.combine

combine(Clerk.isInitialized, Clerk.userFlow) { isInitialized, user ->
    if (isInitialized) {
        // Clerk is ready
        if (user != null) {
            // User is signed in
        } else {
            // User is signed out
        }
    }
}
```

## Access user state

Use `Clerk.userFlow` to reactively observe the current user:

```kotlin
import com.clerk.api.Clerk

// In a ViewModel or Composable
val user by Clerk.userFlow.collectAsState(initial = null)

if (user != null) {
    Text("Welcome, ${user.firstName}")
} else {
    Text("Please sign in")
}
```

## Access the Clerk instance

Access authentication methods through the global `Clerk` object:

```kotlin
import com.clerk.api.Clerk

// Sign in
Clerk.auth.signInWithPassword {
    identifier = "user@email.com"
    password = "secretpassword"
}

// Sign out
Clerk.auth.signOut()
```
