## Usage with frameworks

The following example includes a basic implementation of the `<Waitlist />` component. You can use this as a starting point for your own implementation.

<Tabs items={["Next.js", "React"]}>
  <Tab>
    <CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
      ```jsx {{ filename: '/app/waitlist/[[...waitlist]]/page.tsx' }}
      import { Waitlist } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function WaitlistPage() {
        return <Waitlist />
      }
      ```

      ```jsx {{ filename: '/pages/waitlist/[[...index]].tsx' }}
      import { Waitlist } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function WaitlistPage() {
        return <Waitlist />
      }
      ```
    </CodeBlockTabs>
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```jsx {{ filename: '/waitlist.tsx' }}
    import { Waitlist } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

    export default function WaitlistPage() {
      return <Waitlist />
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
