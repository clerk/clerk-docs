# Sign Up & Sign In

Clerk enables you to build fully custom sign-up and sign-in flows using the `SignUp` and `SignIn` objects.

## `SignUp`

The [`SignUp`][signup-ref] object enables you to build a custom sign-up flow. The [`SignUp`][signup-ref] object will also contain the state of the sign-up attempt that is currently in progress, which gives you the ability to examine all the details and act accordingly.

### Usage

Getting access to the [`SignUp`][signup-ref] object is simple.

The following example accesses the [`SignUp`][signup-ref] object to check the current sign-up attempt's status.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import ClerkSDK

struct SignUpStatusView: View {
    @ObservedObject private var clerk = Clerk.shared
    
    var body: some View {
        if let signUp = clerk.client?.signUp {
            Text("The current sign up attempt status is \(signUp.status.rawValue)")
        }
    }
}
```

The more involved example below shows an approach for creating a custom form for registering users. In this case, the [Password](/docs/custom-flows/email-password) strategy is used. This example assumes that additional requirements, like username or phone, are not enabled. 

```swift
import SwiftUI
import ClerkSDK

struct SignUpView: View {
    @ObservedObject private var clerk = Clerk.shared
    @State private var emailAddress = ""
    @State private var password = ""
    
    var body: some View {
        // if there is already an active SignUp,
        // investigate the SignUp object, to see if
        // the user needs to complete more steps.
        if let signUp = clerk.client?.signUp {
            switch signUp.status {
            case .abandoned:
                //
            case .missingRequirements:
                //
            case .complete:
                //
            }
        } else {
            // if there is not already an active SignUp,
            // collect the information needed to start a new SignUp
            VStack {
                TextField("Email Address", text: $emailAddress)
                SecureField("Password", text: $password)
                Button("Sign Up", action: signUp)
            }
            .padding()
        }
    }
    
    // start the sign up process
    private func signUp() {
        Task {
            do {
                try await clerk.client?.createSignUp(strategy: .standard(emailAddress: emailAddress, password: password))
            } catch {
                print(error.localizedDescription)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## `SignIn`

The [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object and its available methods enable you to build a custom sign-in flow. The [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object will also contain the state of the sign-in attempt that is currently in progress, which gives you the ability to examine all the details and act accordingly.

### Usage

Getting access to the [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object is simple.

The following example accesses the [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object to check the current sign-in attempt's status.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import ClerkSDK

struct SignInStatusView: View {
    @ObservedObject private var clerk = Clerk.shared
    
    var body: some View {
        if let signIn = clerk.client?.signIn {
            Text("The current sign in attempt status is \(signIn.status.rawValue)")
        }
    }
}
```

The more involved example below shows an approach for creating a custom form for signing in users. In this case, a [Password](/docs/custom-flows/email-password) strategy is used.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import ClerkSDK

struct SignInView: View {
    @ObservedObject private var clerk = Clerk.shared
    @State private var emailAddress = ""
    @State private var password = ""
    
    var body: some View {
        // if there is already an active SignIn,
        // investigate the SignIn object, to see if
        // the user needs to complete more steps.
        if let signIn = clerk.client?.signIn {
            switch signIn.status {
            case .needsIdentifier:
                //
            case .needsFirstFactor:
                //
            case .needsSecondFactor:
                //
            case .needsNewPassword:
                //
            case .complete:
                //
            case .abandoned:
                //
            }
        } else {
            // if there is not already an active SignIn,
            // collect the information needed to start a new SignIn
            VStack {
                TextField("Email", text: $emailAddress)
                SecureField("Password", text: $password)
                Button("Sign In", action: signIn)
            }
            .padding()
        }
    }

    // start the sign in process
    private func signIn() {
        Task {
            do {
                try await clerk.client?.createSignIn(strategy: .identifier(emailAddress, password: password))
            } catch {
                print(error.localizedDescription)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
