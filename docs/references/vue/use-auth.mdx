## How to use the `useAuth()` composable

Use `useAuth()` to access the authentication state, protect a page, and fetch data from an external API:

```vue {{ filename: 'App.vue' }}
<script setup>
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/vue'

const { getToken, isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useAuth()

const fetchProtectedData = async () => {
  const token = await getToken.value()

  // Fetch data from an external API
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
  })

  return response.json()
}
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">Loading...</div>
  <div v-else-if="!isSignedIn">Sign in to view this page</div>
  <div v-else>
    <!-- Your protected content here -->
  </div>
</template>
```
