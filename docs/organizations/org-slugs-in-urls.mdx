  - Allow users to choose an organization slug
  - Include an org slug in your URLs
  - Render org-specific content
</TutorialHero>

A common practice for organization-scoped spaces in an app is to prefix URLs with an organization slug. For example, imagine a B2B application named "Petstore" that has two customers: "Acmecorp" and "Widgetco." The app might use URLs such as the following:

`https://petstore.example.com/orgs/`<b>`acmecorp`</b>`/dashboard` indicates **Acmecorp**'s dashboard
`https://petstore.example.com/orgs/`<b>`widgetco`</b>`/dashboard` indicates **Widgetco**'s dashboard

You can also use an [org ID](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization#properties) in URLs to indicate the active org:

`https://petstore.example.com/orgs/`<b>`org_1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8e`</b>`/dashboard` **Acmecorp's org ID** indicates Acmecorp's dashboard

In this guide, you'll learn how to include an org slug in your app's URLs and render information about the user's active org at runtime.

This guide is intended for apps that require org slugs in URLs. **It's recommended against doing this unless necessary**. Consider the following points before implementing:

- User relevance: Will org-specific links add value for your users? If most users belong to a single org (representing their company), they may not need slugs to identify the org when sharing links with coworkers. Public documentation, marketing, and third-party blogs are also easier to write if links aren't tied to any specific org.
- Application complexity: Adding an org slug to URLs introduces an extra piece of state to manage, increasing complexity compared to handling org context within the Clerk session alone.

<Steps>
  ### Define URL patterns

  Define which sections of your app are scoped to orgs and which belong to [personal accounts](/docs/organizations/organization-workspaces#organization-workspaces-in-the-clerk-dashboard:~:text=Personal%20account). The following example assumes that the `/orgs/` prefix indicates an active org, followed by the org slug, and that the `/me/` prefix indicates an active personal account.

  | URL | What should be active? | What should be displayed? |
  | - | - | - |
  | `/orgs/acmecorp` | Organization Acmecorp | Acmecorp's home |
  | `/orgs/acmecorp/settings` | Organization Acmecorp | Acmecorp's settings |
  | `/me` | Personal account | Personal home |
  | `/me/settings` | Personal account | Personal settings |

  ### Configure Clerk components

  The [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/components/organization/organization-switcher) and [`<OrganizationList />`](/docs/components/organization/organization-list) components provide a robust set of options for managing slugs and IDs.

  Configure the components as follows:

  1. Set `hideSlug` to `false` to allow users to customize their org's URL slug when they initially create their org.
  1. Set `afterCreateOrganizationUrl` and `afterSelectOrganizationUrl` to `/orgs/:slug` to navigate the user to the org's slug after they create or select an org, respectively.
  1. Set `hidePersonal` to `false` to ensure the personal account is selectable.
  1. Set `afterSelectPersonalUrl` to `/me` to navigate the user to their personal account after they select their personal account.

  For example, say the slug of the org is `acmecorp`. After the user uses the `<OrganizationSwitcher />` or `<OrganizationList />` component to create or select an org, they'll be redirected to `/orgs/acmecorp`. After the user uses one of these components to select their personal account, they'll be redirected to `/me`.

  <Tabs items={["<OrganizationSwitcher />", "<OrganizationList />"]}>
    <Tab>
      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/header.tsx' }}
      import { OrganizationSwitcher } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function Header() {
        return (
          <OrganizationSwitcher
            // prettier-ignore
            hidePersonal={false}
            hideSlug={false}
            afterCreateOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
            afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
            afterSelectPersonalUrl="/me"
          />
        )
      }
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/organization-list/[[...organization-list]]/page.tsx' }}
      import { OrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function OrganizationListPage() {
        return (
          <OrganizationList
            // prettier-ignore
            hidePersonal={false}
            hideSlug={false}
            afterCreateOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
            afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
            afterSelectPersonalUrl="/me"
          />
        )
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ### Use `clerkMiddleware()` to set the active org

  > [!TIP]
  > If your app doesn't use `clerkMiddleware()`, or you prefer to manually set the active org, the active org can be controlled via the client-side [`setActive()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods) method. Refer to [this guide](/docs/guides/force-organizations#set-an-active-organization-based-on-the-url) to learn how to manually activate a specific org based on the URL.

  With [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware), you can use the [`organizationSyncOptions`](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#organization-sync-options) property to declare URL patterns that determine whether a specific org or the user's personal account should be activated.

  If the middleware detects one of these patterns in the URL and finds that a different org is active in the session, it'll attempt to set the specified org as the active one.

  In the following example, two `organizationPatterns` are defined: one for the root (e.g., `/orgs/acmecorp`) and one using the wildcard matcher `(.*)` to match `/orgs/acmecorp/any/other/resource`. This configuration ensures that the path `/orgs/:slug` with any optional trailing path segments will set the org indicated by the slug as the active one.

  The same approach is used with `personalAccountPatterns` to match the user's personal account.

  > [!WARNING]
  > If no org with the specified slug exists, or the user isn't a member of the org, then `clerkMiddleware()` **won't** modify the active org, leaving the previously active one on the Clerk session.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts', mark: [[7, 11]] }}
  import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  export default clerkMiddleware(
    (auth, req) => {
      // Add your middleware checks
    },
    {
      organizationSyncOptions: {
        organizationPatterns: ['/orgs/:slug', '/orgs/:slug/(.*)'],
        personalAccountPatterns: ['/me', '/me/(.*)'],
      },
    },
  )

  export const config = {
    matcher: [
      // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
      '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
      // Always run for API routes
      '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
    ],
  }
  ```

  ### Handle failed activation

  Now that `clerkMiddleware()` is configured to activate orgs, you can build an org-specific page while handling cases where the org can't be activated.

  Failed activation occurs if no org with the specified slug exists, or if the given user isn't a member of the org. When this happens, the middleware won't change the active org, leaving the previously active one unchanged. For troubleshooting, a message will also be logged on the server:

  > Clerk: Organization activation handshake loop detected. This is likely due to an invalid organization ID or slug. Skipping organization activation.

  It is ultimately the responsibility of the page to ensure that it renders the appropriate content for a given URL, and to handle the case where the expected org **isn't** active. In the following example, the org slug is detected as a NextJS [Dynamic Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) param, and compared to the active org slug. If they don't match, an error message is rendered and the [`<OrganizationList />`](/docs/components/organization/organization-list) component allows the user to select a valid org.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/app/orgs/[slug]/page.tsx' }}
  import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
  import { OrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs'

  export default async function Home({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
    const { orgSlug } = await auth();

    // Check for a match between route param and active organization slug
    // from the user's session, and if so, show the list of valid
    // organizations.
    if (params.slug != orgSlug) {
      return (
        <>
          <p>Sorry, organization {params.slug} is not valid.</p>
          <OrganizationList
            hidePersonal={false}
            hideSlug={false}
            afterCreateOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
            afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
            afterSelectPersonalUrl="/me"
          />
        </>
      )
    }

    return (
      <>
        <h2>Welcome to organization with slug {orgSlug}</h2>
      </>
    )
  }
  ```

  ### Render org-specific content

  Use the following tabs to learn how to access org information on the server-side and client-side.

  <Tabs items={["Server-side","Client-side"]}>
    <Tab>
      To get org information on the server-side, access the [`Auth`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object) object. In Next.js apps, this object is returned by [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth). In other frameworks, you can access `Auth` via the [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) helper.

      To access other org information, such as the org name, [customize the Clerk session token](/docs/backend-requests/making/custom-session-token) to include it:

      1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Sessions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=sessions) page.
      1. In the **Customize session token** section, select **Edit**.
      1. In the modal that opens, add any claim you need to your session token. For this guide, add the following:
         ```json
         {
           "org_name": "{{org.name}}"
         }
         ```
      1. Select **Save**.

      Then you can access the [`sessionClaims`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#:~:text=sessionClaims)
      on the `Auth` object.

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/app/orgs/[slug]/page.tsx' }}
      import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
      import { OrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default async function Home({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
        const { orgSlug } = await auth()

        if (params.slug != orgSlug) {
          return (
            <>
              <p>Sorry, organization {params.slug} is not valid.</p>
              <OrganizationList
                hidePersonal={false}
                hideSlug={false}
                afterCreateOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
                afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
                afterSelectPersonalUrl="/me"
              />
            </>
          )
        }
        let orgName = authObject.sessionClaims['org_name'] as string

        return <div>{orgName && <h2>Welcome to organization {orgName}</h2>}</div>
      }
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      To get org information on the client-side, use the [`useOrganization()`](/docs/references/react/use-organization) hook to access the [`organization`](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) object.

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/app/orgs/[slug]/page.tsx' }}
      'use client'

      import { OrganizationList, useOrganization } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function Home({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
        const { organization } = useOrganization()

        if (!organization || organization.slug != params.slug) {
          return (
            <>
              <p>Sorry, organization {params.slug} is not valid.</p>
              <OrganizationList
                hidePersonal={false}
                hideSlug={false}
                afterCreateOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
                afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
                afterSelectPersonalUrl="/me"
              />
            </>
          )
        }

        return <div>{organization && <h2>Welcome to organization {organization.name}</h2>}</div>
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Steps>
