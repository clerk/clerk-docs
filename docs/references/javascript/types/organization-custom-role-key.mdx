`OrganizationCustomRoleKey` is a type that represents the user's role in an organization. It will be string unless the developer has provided their own types through [`ClerkAuthorization`](/docs/guides/development/override-clerk-types-interfaces#example-custom-roles-and-permissions).

Clerk provides the [default roles](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#default-roles) `org:admin` and `org:member`. However, you can create [custom roles](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#custom-roles) as well.
