The `Web3Wallet` object describes a Web3 wallet address. The address can be used as a proof of identification for users.

Web3 addresses must be verified to ensure that they can be assigned to their rightful owners. The verification is completed via Web3 wallet browser extensions, such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet), and [OKX Wallet](https://www.okx.com/help/section/faq-web3-wallet). The `Web3Wallet3` object holds all the necessary state around the verification process.

The verification process always starts with the [`Web3Wallet.prepareVerification()`](/docs/references/javascript/types/web3-wallet#prepare-verification) or [`signIn.prepareFirstFactor()`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in#prepare-first-factor) method, which will send the wallet address to the [Frontend API](/docs/reference/frontend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} and will receive a nonce that needs to be signed by the Web3 wallet browser extension.

The second and final step involves an attempt to complete the verification by calling [`Web3Wallet.attemptVerification()`](/docs/references/javascript/types/web3-wallet#attempt-verification) method, passing the generated signature as a parameter.

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `id`
  - `string`

  The unique ID for the Web3 wallet.

  An object holding information on the verification of this Web3 wallet.
</Properties>

## Methods

### `create()`

Creates a new Web3 wallet.

```typescript
function create(): Promise<Web3Wallet>
```

### `destroy()`

Deletes this Web3 wallet.

```typescript
function destroy(): Promise<void>
```

### `toString()`

Returns the `web3Wallet` hexadecimal string.

```typescript
function toString(): string
```

## `prepareVerification()`

Kick off the verification process for this Web3 wallet. The user will be prompted to sign a generated nonce by the browser extension e.g MetaMask. Returns a `Web3Wallet` object.

```typescript
function prepareVerification(params: PrepareWeb3WalletVerificationParams): Promise<Web3Wallet>
```

### `PrepareWeb3WalletVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'web3_metamask_signature'` | `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'` | `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`

  The verification strategy to validate the user's sign-up request. The following strategies are supported:

  - `'web3_metamask_signature'`: User will need to sign a message and generate a signature using MetaMask browser extension.
  - `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'`: User will need to sign a message and generate a signature using Coinbase Wallet.
  - `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`: User will need to sign a message and generate a signature using OKX Wallet.
</Properties>

## `attemptVerification()`

Attempts to verify this Web3 wallet, by passing the generated signature. Returns a `Web3Wallet` object.

```typescript
function attemptVerification(params: AttemptWeb3WalletVerificationParams): Promise<Web3Wallet>
```

### `AttemptWeb3WalletVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `signature`
  - `string`

  The signature that was generated after [`prepareVerification`](#prepare-verification) was called.
</Properties>
