# Testing

Testing is an important part of every application. Clerk has built some helpers to make testing your application with Clerk easier, with more on the way. End-to-end (E2E) tests should be possible in any framework. However, each framework may require a slightly different setup. If you're having trouble getting testing to work properly, [send us a message](https://clerk.com/support) and we'll be able to help.

<Callout type="warning">
  Clerk's APIs do have Rate limits per IP address, you should write your e2e tests in a way that does not sign in on each test, and instead, you should sign in once for all, or most, of your tests

## Testing with one time passcodes

To avoid sending an email or SMS message with a one time passcode (OTP) during testing, you can use a faux email address or phone number that has a fixed code. Read the complete documentation [here](https://clerk.com/docs/testing/test-emails-and-phones).

## Testing frameworks

We've written some tutorials using popular JS testing frameworks. More coming soon.
