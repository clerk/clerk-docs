## Methods

### `createBackupCode()`

Generates a fresh new set of backup codes for the user. Every time the method is called, it will replace the previously generated backup codes. Returns a [`BackupCodeResource`][backupcode-ref] object.

> [!WARNING]
> Can only be created for the user if the user has _another_ multi-factor authentication method enabled for their account, in the Clerk Dashboard, as backup codes are a fallback for when the user is unable to use their primary MFA method.

```typescript
function createBackupCode(): Promise<BackupCodeResource>
```

#### Example

```js
await clerk.user.createBackupCode()
```

### `createEmailAddress()`

Adds an email address for the user. A new [`EmailAddress`](/docs/references/javascript/types/email-address) will be created and associated with the user.

> [!WARNING]
> **Email address** must be enabled as an identifier in your app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard. See the [Identifiers](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#identifiers) section to learn more.

```ts
function createEmailAddress(params: CreateEmailAddressParams): Promise<EmailAddress>
```

#### `CreateEmailAddressParams`

<Properties>
  - `email`
  - `string`

  The value of the email address
</Properties>

### Example

```js
await clerk.user.createEmailAddress({ email: 'test@test.com' })
```

### `createExternalAccount()`

Adds an external account for the user. A new [`ExternalAccount`](/docs/references/javascript/types/external-account) will be created and associated with the user. This method is useful if you want to allow an already signed-in user to connect their account with an external provider, such as Facebook, GitHub, etc., so that they can sign in with that provider in the future.

> [!WARNING]
> The social provider that you want to connect to must be enabled in your app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard. See the [Social connections (OAuth)](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#social-connections-o-auth) section to learn more.

```ts
function createExternalAccount(params: CreateExternalAccountParams): Promise<ExternalAccount>
```

#### `CreateExternalAccountParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - [`OAuthStrategy`](/docs/references/javascript/types/sso#o-auth-strategy)

  The strategy corresponding to the OAuth provider. For example: `'oauth_facebook'`, `'oauth_github'`, etc.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The full URL or path that the OAuth provider should redirect to, on successful authorization on their part. Typically, this will be a simple `/sso-callback` route that calls [`Clerk.handleRedirectCallback`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk#handle-redirect-callback) or mounts the [`<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />`](/docs/components/control/authenticate-with-callback) component. See the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/oauth-connections) for implementation details.

  ---

  - `additionalScopes?`
  - `string[]`

  Additional scopes for your user to be prompted to approve.

  ---

  - `oidcPrompt?`
  - `string`

  The value to pass to the [OIDC `prompt` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=prompt,reauthentication%20and%20consent.) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.

  ---

  - `oidcLoginHint?`
  - `string`

  The value to pass to the [OIDC `login_hint` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=login_hint,in%20\(if%20necessary\).) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.
</Properties>

#### Example

After calling `createExternalAccount`, the initial `state` of the returned `ExternalAccount` will be `unverified`. To initiate the connection with the external provider, redirect the user to the `externalAccount.verification.externalVerificationRedirectURL` contained in the result of `createExternalAccount`.

Upon return, inspect within the `user.externalAccounts` the entry that corresponds to the requested strategy:

- If the connection succeeded, then `externalAccount.verification.status` will be `verified`.
- If the connection failed, then the `externalAccount.verification.status` will not be `verified` and the `externalAccount.verification.error` will contain the error encountered, which you can present to the user. To learn more about the properties available on `verification`, see the [`verification`](/docs/references/javascript/types/verification) reference.

The following example demonstrates how to add a Notion account as an external account for the user. When the user selects the "Add Notion as a social connection" button, the user will be redirected to Notion to connect their account. After connecting their account, they will be redirected to the `/` route of your application, and the status of the connection will be displayed.
