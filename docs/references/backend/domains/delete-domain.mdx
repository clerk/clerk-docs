# `deleteDomain()`

Deletes a satellite domain for the instance. It is currently not possible to delete the instance's primary domain.

```tsx
function deleteDomain: (id: string) => Promise<User>;
```

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `id` | `string` | The ID of the domain that will be deleted. Must be a satellite domain. |

## Example

```tsx
const id = 'test_123';

const response = await clerkClient.users.deleteDomain(id);

console.log(response);
/*
_DeletedObject {
  object: 'domain',
  id: 'test_123',
  slug: null,
  deleted: true
}
*/
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `DELETE/domains/{domain_id}`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Domains#operation/DeleteDomain) for more details.
