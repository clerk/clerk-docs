  - Use Twitch to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference#oauth-client-credentials-flow) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Twitch account.

You must have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled on your Twitch account to setup OAuth. To enable 2FA:

1. In the top-right of the [Twitch Developer console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console), select your avatar and select **Account Settings**.
1. Select the **Security & Privacy** tab.
1. Under **Security**, select **Set Up Two-Factor Authentication**.
1. Select **Enable 2FA**. A modal will open.
1. Enter your phone number and select **Continue**.
1. Enter the code sent to your phone and select **Continue**.
1. If you want to use an authenticator app, follow the instructions on the screen. Otherwise, select **Skip & Use SMS**.
1. Select **Done**.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Twitch**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console).
