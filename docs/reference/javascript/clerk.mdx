This method is primarily used to build frontend SDKs like [`@clerk/clerk-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clerk/clerk-react). Returns an `UnsubscribeCallback` function that can be used to remove the listener from the `Clerk` object.

```typescript
function addListener(listener: (emission: Resources) => void): UnsubscribeCallback
```

### `handleEmailLinkVerification()`

Handles the completion of an email link verification flow by processing the verification results from the redirect URL query parameters. This method should be called after the user is redirected back from visiting the verification link in their email.

```typescript
function handleEmailLinkVerification(
  params: handleEmailLinkVerificationParams,
  customNavigate?: ((to: string) => Promise<unknown>) | undefined,
): Promise<unknown>
```

The `handleEmailLinkVerification()` method finalizes an email verification flow that begins when a user initiates email verification and ends when they visit the verification link.

Email verification can be completed on any device - not necessarily the one where it was initiated. For example, a user could start verification on desktop but click the email link on mobile.

When a user visits the verification link, they are redirected to the URL specified during flow initialization. Clerk appends these query parameters to the URL:

- `__clerk_status`: The verification outcome:
  - `verified`: Verification succeeded.
  - `failed`: Verification failed.
  - `expired`: Link expired.
  - `client_mismatch`: Device/browser mismatch (only if [same device verification](/docs/guides/secure/best-practices/protect-email-links) is enabled).
- `__clerk_created_session`: ID of any new session created. Since verification can happen on a different device, this session may not appear in [`Client.sessions`](/docs/reference/javascript/client#properties).

The method handles the verification outcome as follows:

1. On successful verification, it:
   - Determines if sign-in/sign-up is complete
   - Redirects accordingly using the provided URLs (both optional):
     - `redirectUrlComplete`: URL for completed sign-in/sign-up.
     - `redirectUrl`: URL if there are further requirements for the sign-in/sign-up attempt, such as MFA.
   - Executes an optional callback if verification happened on another device.

1. On verification failure:
   - Throws an [`EmailLinkError`](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-links).
   - Error code indicates if link expired or verification failed.

Take a look at the function parameters below for more usage details.

#### Parameters

<Properties>
  - `params`
  - [`handleEmailLinkVerificationParams`](#handle-email-link-verification-params)

  Allows you to define the URLs where the user should be redirected to on successful verification or pending/completed sign-up or sign-in attempts. If the email link is successfully verified on another device, there's a callback function parameter that allows custom code execution.

  ---

  - `customNavigate?`
  - `(to: string) => Promise<unknown>`

  A function that overrides Clerk's default navigation behavior, allowing custom handling of navigation during sign-up and sign-in flows.
</Properties>

#### `handleEmailLinkVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `redirectUrlComplete?`
  - `string | undefined`

  The full URL to navigate to after successful email link verification on completed sign-up or sign-in on the same device.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl?`
  - `string | undefined`

  The full URL to navigate to after successful email link verification on the same device, but without completing sign-in or sign-up.

  ---

  - `onVerifiedOnOtherDevice?`
  - `() => void`

  Callback function to be executed after successful email link verification on another device.
</Properties>

  - <code>[SignUpRedirectOptions](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sign-up-redirect-options) | undefined</code>

  Options to use in the redirect, such as `signUpForceRedirectUrl` and `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl`.
</Properties>

#### Example

```js
await clerk.redirectToSignUp({
  signUpForceRedirectUrl: '/dashboard',
  signUpFallbackRedirectUrl: '/dashboard',
})
```

### `redirectToUserProfile()`

Returns a promise that can be `await`ed in order to listen for the navigation to finish. The inner value should not be relied on, as it can change based on the framework it's used within.

```typescript
function redirectToUserProfile(): Promise<unknown>
```

#### Example

```js
await clerk.redirectToUserProfile()
```

### `redirectWithAuth()`

Redirects to the provided URL after appending authentication credentials. For development instances, this method decorates the URL with an auth token to maintain authentication state. For production instances, the standard session cookie is used.

Returns a promise that can be `await`ed in order to listen for the navigation to finish. The inner value should not be relied on, as it can change based on the framework it's used within.

```typescript
function redirectWithAuth(to: string): Promise<unknown>
```

#### Parameters

<Properties>
  - `to`
  - `string | undefined`

  The route to navigate to
</Properties>

#### Example

```js
await clerk.redirectWithAuth('/dashboard')
```

### `setActive()`

A method used to set the current session and/or Organization for the client. Accepts a [`SetActiveParams`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/set-active-params) object.

```typescript
function setActive(params: SetActiveParams): Promise<void>
```

#### Example

The `setActive()` method is most commonly used when building a [custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview) for your application.

For example, during authentication, when a user signs in or signs up successfully, a new session is created. `setActive()` needs to be used to set the new session as the active session. See the implementation of this in the [Custom authentication flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview) guide.

Another example is when a user switches Organizations in a multi-Organization application. `setActive()` needs to be used to set the new Organization as the [Active Organization](!active-organization). See the implementation of this in the [Custom Organization switcher](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/organizations/organization-switcher) guide.

### `signOut()`

- In a [multi-session application](/docs/guides/secure/session-options#multi-session-applications): Signs out the active user from all sessions
- In a single-session context: Signs out the active user from the current session

The current client will be deleted. You can specify a specific session to sign out by passing the `sessionId` parameter.

```typescript
function signOut(options?: SignOutOptions): Promise<void>
// OR
function signOut(
  signOutCallback?: () => void | Promise<any>,
  options?: SignOutOptions,
): Promise<void>
```

#### `SignOutOptions`

<Properties>
  - `sessionId?`
  - `string`

  Specify a specific session to sign out. Useful for multi-session applications.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The full URL or path to navigate to after sign out is complete.
</Properties>

#### Example

```js
await clerk.signOut()
```
