How to set up social connection with Twitch

## Overview

Adding social connection with Twitch to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your Twitch account.

> [!NOTE]
> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Twitch account and a Twitch OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Twitch account. To create one, [click here](https://www.twitch.tv/).

## Configuring Twitch social connection

First, you need to register a new OAuth Twitch app at the [Twitch Developers Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console).

Set a name and a category for your new application. You also need to add the **OAuth Redirect URLs.** In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)** and enable Twitch. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Paste the value into the **OAuth Redirect URLs** input and click create.

Once all the above are complete, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret.** Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with Twitch is now configured for your instance.
