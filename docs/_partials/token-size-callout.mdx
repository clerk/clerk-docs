> **It's recommended to keep the total size of custom claims in the session token under 1.2KB.** Exceeding this size can have adverse effects, such as possible infinite redirect loops in Next.js applications. It's recommended to move particularly large claims out of the JWT and fetch these using a separate API call from your backend.
