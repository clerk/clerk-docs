This guide will walk you through how to build a custom user interface that allows users to **add a new payment method to their account**. This is a common feature in a user's billing or account settings page, allowing them to pre-emptively add a payment method for future use.

For the custom flow that allows users to add a new payment method **during checkout**, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/billing/checkout-new-payment-method).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Billing Features

  To use Billing Features, you first need to ensure they are enabled for your application. Follow the [Billing documentation](/docs/guides/billing/overview) to enable them and set up your Plans.

  ### Add payment method flow

  To add a new payment method for a user, you must:

  1. Set up the [`<PaymentElementProvider />`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-payment-element) to create a context for the user's payment actions.
  1. Render the [`<PaymentElement />`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-payment-element) to display the secure payment fields from your provider.
  1. Use the [`usePaymentElement()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-payment-element) hook to submit the form and create a payment token.
  1. Use the [`useUser()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-user) hook to attach the newly created payment method to the user.
