How to set up social connection with Coinbase

## Overview

Adding social connection with Coinbase to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your Coinbase account.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Coinbase developer account and a Coinbase OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Coinbase developer account. To create one, [click here](https://www.coinbase.com/).

## Configuring Coinbase social connection

First, you need to create a new OAuth2 Coinbase app. You can find this option in your **Profile > Settings > API > New OAuth2 Application**.

You need to set all the required fields and the corresponding **Permitted Redirect URIs**. Under **Advanced Settings**, make sure to also select **Reuse Existing Tokens** for **Previously-Authorized Users** so that your users won't get notified everytime they sign in with their Coinbase account. Then, click **Create application**.

In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)** and enable Coinbase. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Make sure the value matches the **Redirect URIs**, as shown below.

Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** as shown in the above image. Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with Coinbase is now configured for your instance.
