The simplest way to test your connection is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/docs/guides/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/account-portal) page.
1. Next to **Sign-in**, select the button to visit the sign-in page. The URL should resemble:
   - **For development** - `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
   - **For production** - `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
1. Sign in with your connection's credentials.
