# Protect email link sign-ins and sign-ups

Clerk provides an additional setting to improve security for email link sign-ins and sign-ups. When this setting is enabled, only email links opened on the same device and browser that a sign-in or sign-up was initiated on will successfully authenticate the user.

Enabling this protection means that the following scenario cannot happen:

1. A malicious actor knows the email of a user and requests an email link to sign-in or sign-up.
2. The user opens the email and visits the link, or the user's email provider follows links in emails for phishing or spam protection.
3. The malicious actor is able to gain access to the user's account because the email link has been opened successfully.

With same device and browser protection on, users will see the following warning if an email link for sign-in or sign-up was opened on a different device or browser:

/>

To configure this security setting, go to [Email, Phone, and Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) section of the Clerk Dashboard.

To enable this protection for sign-ups, go to **Contact information** > **Email address**. Open the modal and make sure **Require the same device and browser** is enabled under the **Email verification link** checkbox.

To enable this protection for sign-ins, go to **Authentication strategies** > **Email verification link**. Ensure **Require the same device and browser** is toggled on in the configuration modal.
