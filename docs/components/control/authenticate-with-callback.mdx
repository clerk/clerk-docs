title: <code>\<AuthenticateWith<wbr />RedirectCallbackÂ /></code>
description: Clerk's `<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />` component is used to implement custom OAuth flows. It handles the OAuth callback and completes the authentication process.
---

The `<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />` component is a crucial part of implementing custom OAuth flows in your application. It serves as the callback handler for the authentication process initiated by the `authenticateWithRedirect()` method. Render it on the route specified as the `redirectUrl` in your `authenticateWithRedirect()` call.

This component automatically handles the OAuth callback, completing the authentication process and managing the user's session.

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `signInUrl?`
  - `string`

  Full URL or path where the SignIn component is mounted.

  ---

  - `signUpUrl?`
  - `string`

  Full URL or path where the SignUp component is mounted.

  ---

  - `signInFallbackRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The fallback URL to redirect to after the user signs in, if there's no `redirect_url` in the path already. Defaults to `/`. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.

  ---

  - `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The fallback URL to redirect to after the user signs up, if there's no `redirect_url` in the path already. Defaults to `/`. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.

  ---

  - `signInForceRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  If provided, this URL will always be redirected to after the user signs in. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.

  ---

  - `signUpForceRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  If provided, this URL will always be redirected to after the user signs up. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.

  ---

  - `firstFactorUrl`
  - `string | undefined`

  Full URL or path to navigate during sign in, if identifier verification is required.

  ---

  - `secondFactorUrl`
  - `string | undefined`

  Full URL or path to navigate during sign in, if 2FA is enabled.

  ---

  - `resetPasswordUrl`
  - `string`

  Full URL or path to navigate during sign in, if the user is required to reset their password.

  ---

  - `afterSignInUrl` (deprecated)
  - `string`

  Full URL or path to navigate to after successful sign in. Defaults to `/`. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#deprecated) instead. **`signInFallbackRedirectUrl` and `signInforceRedirectUrl` have priority and should be used instead.**

  ---

  - `afterSignUpUrl` (deprecated)
  - `string`

  Full URL or path to navigate to after successful sign up. Defaults to `/`. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#deprecated) instead. **`signUpFallbackRedirectUrl` and `signUpforceRedirectUrl` have priority and should be used instead.**

  ---

  - `redirectUrl` (deprecated)
  - `string`

  Full URL or path to navigate after successful sign in or sign up. This is the same as setting `afterSignInUrl` and `afterSignUpUrl` to the same value. The **`signXfallbackRedirectUrl` and `signXforceRedirectUrl` props have priority over the deprecated `redirectUrl` and should be used instead.**
</Properties>

## Usage

In the following example, when a user selects the "Sign in with Google" button, they are redirected to Google for authentication. After successful authentication, Google redirects the user back to your application at the `/sso-callback` route, where the `<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />` component is automatically rendered. This component handles the OAuth callback, completes the authentication process, and manages the user's session.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx', collapsible: true }}
    'use client'

    import { ClerkProvider, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton, useSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    const SignInOAuthButtons = () => {
      const { signIn, isLoaded } = useSignIn()

      if (!isLoaded) {
        return null
      }

      const signInWithGoogle = () =>
        signIn.authenticateWithRedirect({
          strategy: 'oauth_google',
          redirectUrl: '/sso-callback',
          redirectUrlComplete: '/',
        })

      return <button onClick={signInWithGoogle}>Sign in with Google</button>
    }

    export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider>
          <html lang="en">
            <body>
              <header>
                <SignedOut>
                  <SignInOAuthButtons />
                </SignedOut>
                <SignedIn>
                  <UserButton />
                </SignedIn>
              </header>
              <main>{children}</main>
            </body>
          </html>
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    }
    ```

    Once you have implemented your sign-in flow, you can implement the callback page.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sso-callback/page.tsx' }}
    import { AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    export default function Page() {
      return <AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

    The following example is using the `react-router-dom` library, but you can use any routing library you want.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app.tsx', collapsible: true }}
    import {
      ClerkProvider,
      AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback,
      SignedOut,
      useSignIn,
      SignedIn,
    } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

    import { Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom'

    function App() {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider publishableKey={'{{pub_key}}'}>
          {/* Define a / route that displays the OAuth button */}
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<HomePages />} />

            {/* Define a /sso-callback route that renders the <AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback /> component */}
            <Route path="/sso-callback" element={<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />} />
          </Routes>
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    }

    function HomePages() {
      return (
        <>
          <SignedOut>
            <SignInOAuthButtons />
          </SignedOut>
          <SignedIn>
            <div>You are signed in</div>
          </SignedIn>
        </>
      )
    }

    function SignInOAuthButtons() {
      const { signIn, isLoaded } = useSignIn()
      if (!isLoaded) {
        return null
      }
      const signInWithGoogle = () =>
        signIn.authenticateWithRedirect({
          strategy: 'oauth_google',
          redirectUrl: '/sso-callback',
          redirectUrlComplete: '/',
        })
      return <button onClick={signInWithGoogle}>Sign in with Google</button>
    }

    export default App
    ```
