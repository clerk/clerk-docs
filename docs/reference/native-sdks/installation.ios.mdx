description: Install the Clerk iOS SDK with Swift Package Manager.
sdk: ios
---

Use Swift Package Manager to add `ClerkKit` (core API) and `ClerkKitUI` (prebuilt SwiftUI views) to your app target.

## Install via Xcode

1. In Xcode, open the **Package Dependencies** tab and click the **+** button.
1. Search for `https://github.com/clerk/clerk-ios`.
1. Select the `Clerk` package in the results list.
1. Set the dependency rule to **Up to Next Major Version**.
1. Make sure your app target is selected in **Add to Project**, then select **Add Package**.
1. In **Choose Package Products**, select `ClerkKit` and `ClerkKitUI`, then select **Add Package**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't want to use Clerk's [prebuilt views](/docs/reference/views/overview), you can just add `ClerkKit`.

## Install via Package.swift

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/clerk/clerk-ios", from: "1.0.0")
]

targets: [
  .target(
