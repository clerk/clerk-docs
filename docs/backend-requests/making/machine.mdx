title: Making Machine Requests
description: Lean about making machine-to-machine requests.

If your client is a backend service, you can create a [machine token](/docs/backend-requests/resources/machine-tokens) and use it in the `Authorization` header of your request.

## Using the Node.js SDK

The Node.js SDK has a `machineTokens` object that can be used to create machine tokens.

> [!WARNING]
> Use of the Node.js SDK is still subject to the [Backend API rate limits](/docs/backend-requests/resources/rate-limits)

```tsx
import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend'

export default function machineFetch() {

  const clerkClient = createClerkClient({ secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY })

  // creates a token with no additional claims.
  const { token } = await clerkClient.machineTokens.create({
      machineId: "mch_cron",
      claims: {
        permissions: ["read", "write"]
      }, // custom claims customer's can add to their token
      expiresInSeconds: 60
  });

  const authenticatedFetch = async (...args) => {
    return fetch(...args, {
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${await getToken()}` },
    }).then((res) => res.json())
  }

  return authenticatedFetch
}
```

## Using the Backend API reference

You can also generate machine tokens by simply making a requests to Clerk's Backend API
