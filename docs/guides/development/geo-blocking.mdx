description: Learn how to add geo blocking to your Next.js + Clerk application.

While Clerk does not provide a geo blocking feature, deployment platforms, such as Vercel and Render, expose geolocation data through request headers. This allows you to implement custom geo blocking logic by accessing the client's location data at runtime and conditionally allowing or blocking requests based on your requirements.

    The following example shows how to implement geo blocking in your [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware) using [Vercel's `geolocation()` function](https://vercel.com/guides/geo-ip-headers-geolocation-vercel-functions). If a user visits any route that is not a `/block` route, the middleware checks the client's country and redirects to the `/block` route if the country is not allowed. If that route is protected, the middleware also checks if the user is authenticated.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'proxy.ts' }}
    import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
    import { geolocation } from '@vercel/functions'
    import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

    // Define your protected and blocked routes
    const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)'])
    const isBlockRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/block(.*)'])

    // Define the countries you want to allow
    const allowedCountries = ['US']

    export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
      if (isBlockRoute(req)) {
        return
      }

      // Use Vercel's `geolocation()` function to get the client's country
      const { country } = geolocation(req)

      // Redirect if the client's country is not allowed
      if (country && !allowedCountries.includes(country)) {
        return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/block', req.url))
      }

      // Protect routes based on authentication status
      if (isProtectedRoute(req)) await auth.protect()
    })

    export const config = {
      matcher: [
        // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
        '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
        // Always run for API routes

    The following example shows how to implement geo blocking in your [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware) using Render's `cf-ipcountry` header. If a user visits any route that is not a `/block` route, the middleware checks the client's country and redirects to the `/block` route if the country is not allowed. If that route is protected, the middleware also checks if the user is authenticated.
