title: clerkMiddleware() | Next.js
description: The clerkMiddleware() function allows you to protect your Next.js application using Middleware.
---

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Next.js application through Middleware. `clerkMiddleware()` is compatible with both the App and Pages routers.

## Configure `clerkMiddleware()`

Create a `middleware.ts` file at the root of your project, or in your `src/` directory if you have one.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about Middleware in Next.js, see the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware).

```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default clerkMiddleware()

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

By default, `clerkMiddleware` will not protect any routes. All routes are public and you must opt-in to protection for routes.

## `createRouteMatcher()`

`createRouteMatcher()` is a Clerk helper function that allows you to protect multiple routes. `createRouteMatcher()` accepts an array of routes and checks if the route the user is trying to visit matches one of the routes passed to it. The paths provided to this helper can be in the same format as the paths provided to the Next Middleware matcher.

The `createRouteMatcher()` helper returns a function that, if called with the `req` object from the Middleware, will return `true` if the user is trying to access a route that matches one of the routes passed to `createRouteMatcher()`.

In the following example, `createRouteMatcher()` sets all `/dashboard` and `/forum` routes as protected routes.

```tsx
const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)', '/forum(.*)'])
```

## Protect API routes

You can protect routes using either or both of the following:

- [Authentication-based protection](#protect-routes-based-on-authentication-status): Verify if the user is signed in.
- [Authorization-based protection](#protect-routes-based-on-authorization-status): Verify if the user has the required organization roles or custom permissions.

### Protect routes based on authentication status

You can protect routes based on a user's authentication status by checking if the user is signed in.

There are two methods that you can use:

- Use [`auth.protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) if you want to redirect unauthenticated users to the sign-in route automatically.
- Use [`auth().userId`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#retrieving-user-id) if you want more control over what your app does based on user authentication status.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["auth.protect()", "auth().userId()"]}>
  ```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
  import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)', '/forum(.*)'])

  export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
    if (isProtectedRoute(req)) await auth.protect()
  })

  export const config = {
    matcher: [
      // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
      '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
      // Always run for API routes
      '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
    ],
  }
  ```

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/middleware.ts' }}
  import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)', '/forum(.*)'])

  export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
    const { userId, redirectToSignIn } = await auth()

    if (!userId && isProtectedRoute(req)) {
      // Add custom logic to run before redirecting

      return redirectToSignIn()
    }
  })

  export const config = {
    matcher: [
      // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
      '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
      // Always run for API routes
      '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
    ],
  }
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Protect routes based on authorization status

You can protect routes based on a user's authorization status by checking if the user has the required roles or permissions.

There are two methods that you can use:

- Use [`auth.protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) if you want Clerk to return a `404` if the user does not have the role or permission.
- Use [`auth().has()`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#has) if you want more control over what your app does based on the authorization status.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
    import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/admin(.*)'])

    export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
      // Restrict admin routes to users with specific permissions
      if (isProtectedRoute(req)) {
        await auth.protect((has) => {
          return has({ permission: 'org:admin:example1' }) || has({ permission: 'org:admin:example2' })
        })
      }
    })

    export const config = {
      matcher: [
        // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params

    const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/admin(.*)'])

    export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
      const { has, redirectToSignIn } = await auth()
      // Restrict admin routes to users with specific permissions
      if (
        (isProtectedRoute(req) && !has({ permission: 'org:admin:example1' })) ||
        !has({ permission: 'org:admin:example2' })
      ) {
        // Add logic to run if the user does not have the required permissions

        return redirectToSignIn()
      }
    })

    export const config = {

        // Always run for API routes
        '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
      ],
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Protect multiple groups of routes

You can use more than one `createRouteMatcher()` in your application if you have two or more groups of routes.

The following example uses the [`has()`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#has) method from the `auth()` helper.

```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

const isTenantRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/organization-selector(.*)', '/orgid/(.*)'])

const isTenantAdminRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/orgId/(.*)/memberships', '/orgId/(.*)/domain'])

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  // Restrict admin routes to users with specific permissions
  if (isTenantAdminRoute(req)) {
    await auth.protect((has) => {
      return has({ permission: 'org:admin:example1' }) || has({ permission: 'org:admin:example2' })
    })
  }
  // Restrict organization routes to signed in users
  if (isTenantRoute(req)) await auth.protect()
})

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

## Protect all routes

To protect all routes in your application and define specific routes as public, you can use any of the above methods and simply invert the `if` condition.

```jsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/sign-in(.*)', '/sign-up(.*)'])

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, request) => {
  if (!isPublicRoute(request)) {
    await auth.protect()
  }
})

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

## Debug your Middleware

If you are having issues getting your Middleware dialed in, or are trying to narrow down auth-related issues, you can use the debugging feature in `clerkMiddleware()`. Add `{ debug: true }` to `clerkMiddleware()` and you will get debug logs in your terminal.

```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts', mark: [[4, 7]] }}
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default clerkMiddleware(
  (auth, req) => {
    // Add your middleware checks
  },
  { debug: true },
)

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

If you would like to set up debugging for your development environment only, you can use the `process.env.NODE_ENV` variable to conditionally enable debugging. For example, `{ debug: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' }`.

## Combine Middleware

You can combine other Middleware with Clerk's Middleware by returning the second Middleware from `clerkMiddleware()`.

```js {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher, redirectToSignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware'

import { AppConfig } from './utils/AppConfig'

const intlMiddleware = createMiddleware({
  locales: AppConfig.locales,
  localePrefix: AppConfig.localePrefix,
  defaultLocale: AppConfig.defaultLocale,
})

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['dashboard/(.*)'])

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  if (isProtectedRoute(req)) await auth.protect()

  return intlMiddleware(req)
})

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

## `clerkMiddleware()` options

<Include src="_partials/clerk-middleware-options" />

It's also possible to dynamically set options based on the incoming request:

```ts {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default clerkMiddleware(
  (auth, req) => {
    // Add your middleware checks
  },
  (req) => ({
    // Provide `domain` based on the request host
    domain: req.nextUrl.host,
  }),
)
```

### Dynamic keys

> [!NOTE]
> Dynamic keys are not accessible on the client-side.

The following options, known as "Dynamic Keys," are shared to the Next.js application server through `clerkMiddleware`, enabling access by server-side helpers like [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth):

- `signUpUrl`
- `signInUrl`
- `secretKey`
- `publishableKey`

Dynamic keys are encrypted and shared during request time using a [AES encryption algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard). When providing a `secretKey`, the `CLERK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable is mandatory and used as the encryption key. If no `secretKey` is provided to `clerkMiddleware`, the encryption key defaults to `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`.

When providing `CLERK_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, it is recommended to use a 32-byte (256-bit), pseudorandom value. You can use `openssl` to generate a key:

```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
openssl rand --hex 32
```

For multi-tenant applications, you can dynamically define Clerk keys depending on the incoming request. Here's an example:

```ts {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

// You would typically fetch these keys from a external store or environment variables.
const tenantKeys = {
  tenant1: { publishableKey: 'pk_tenant1...', secretKey: 'sk_tenant1...' },
  tenant2: { publishableKey: 'pk_tenant2...', secretKey: 'sk_tenant2...' },
}

export default clerkMiddleware(
  (auth, req) => {
    // Add your middleware checks
  },
  (req) => {
    // Resolve tenant based on the request
    const tenant = getTenant(req)
    return tenantKeys[tenant]
  },
)
```

### `OrganizationSyncOptions`

The `organizationSyncOptions` property on the [`clerkMiddleware()`](#clerk-middleware-options) options
object has the type `OrganizationSyncOptions`, which has the following properties:

<Properties>
  - `organizationPatterns`
  - <code>[Pattern](#pattern)\[]</code>

  Specifies URL patterns that are organization-specific, containing an organization ID or slug as a path parameter. If a request
  matches this path, the organization identifier will be used to set that org as active.

  If the route also matches the `personalAccountPatterns` prop, this prop takes precedence.

  Patterns must have a path parameter named either `:id` (to match a Clerk organization ID) or `:slug` (to match a Clerk organization slug).

  > [!WARNING]
  > If the organization can't be activated—either because it doesn't exist or the user lacks access—the previously active organization will remain unchanged. Components must detect this case and provide an appropriate error and/or resolution pathway, such as calling `notFound()` or displaying an [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/components/organization/organization-switcher).

  Common examples:

  - `["/orgs/:slug", "/orgs/:slug/(.*)"]`
  - `["/orgs/:id", "/orgs/:id/(.*)"]`
  - `["/app/:any/orgs/:slug", "/app/:any/orgs/:slug/(.*)"]`

  ---

  - `personalAccountPatterns`
  - <code>[Pattern](#pattern)\[]</code>

  URL patterns for resources that exist within the context of a [Clerk Personal Account](/docs/organizations/organization-workspaces#organization-workspaces-in-the-clerk-dashboard:~:text=Personal%20account) (user-specific, outside any
  organization).

  If the route also matches the `organizationPattern` prop, the `organizationPattern` prop takes precedence.

  Common examples:

  - `["/me", "/me/(.*)"]`
  - `["/user/:any", "/user/:any/(.*)"]`
</Properties>

### Pattern

A `Pattern` is a `string` that represents the structure of a URL path. In addition to any valid URL, it may include:

- Named path parameters prefixed with a colon (e.g., `:id`, `:slug`, `:any`).
- Wildcard token, `(.*)`, which matches the remainder of the path.

#### Examples

- `/orgs/:slug`

| URL | Matches | `:slug` value |
| - | - | - |
| `/orgs/acmecorp` | ✅ | `acmecorp` |
| `/orgs` | ❌ | n/a |
| `/orgs/acmecorp/settings` | ❌ | n/a |

- `/app/:any/orgs/:id`

| URL | Matches | `:id` value |
| - | - | - |
| `/app/petstore/orgs/org_123` | ✅ | `org_123` |
| `/app/dogstore/v2/orgs/org_123` | ❌ | n/a |

- `/personal-account/(.*)`

| URL | Matches |
| - | - |
| `/personal-account/settings` | ✅ |
| `/personal-account` | ❌ |
