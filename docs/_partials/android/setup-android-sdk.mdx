Add the Clerk Android SDK and Android's Lifecycle ViewModel Compose library to your application's dependencies:

```gradle
dependencies {
   ...
   implementation("com.clerk:clerk-android:<latest-version>")
   implementation("androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-compose:2.9.2")
   ...
}
```

## Initialize Clerk

In `app/src/main/java/com/example/myclerkapp/`, create a Kotlin class named `MyClerkApp`. Add the following code to:

<SignedIn>
  1. Create a subclass of `Application` named after your application (e.g., `MyClerkApp`).
  1. In this subclass, override the `onCreate()` method and call `Clerk.initialize()` to initialize the Clerk Android SDK with your application context (`this`) and Clerk Publishable Key. Your Publishable Key can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
</SignedIn>

<SignedOut>
  1. Create a subclass of `Application` named after your application (e.g., `MyClerkApp`).
  1. In this subclass, override the `onCreate()` method and call `Clerk.initialize()` to initialize the Clerk Android SDK with your application context (`this`) and Clerk Publishable Key.

  To find your Publishable Key:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
  1. Copy your Clerk Publishable Key. It's prefixed with `pk_test_` for development instances and `pk_live_` for production instances.
