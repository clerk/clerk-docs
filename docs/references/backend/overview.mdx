# Clerk Backend SDK

The [Clerk Backend SDK](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/tree/main/packages/backend) exposes Clerk's backend API resources and low-level authentication utilities for JavaScript environments. While the backend SDK is mainly used as a building block for Clerk's higher-level SDKs, it can also be used on its own for advanced flows and custom integrations.

Clerk SDKs expose an instance of the Clerk Backend SDK for use in server environments.
