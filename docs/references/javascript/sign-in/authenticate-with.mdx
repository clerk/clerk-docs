These are all methods on the [`SignIn`][signin-ref] class that allow you to authenticate with different methods.

## Methods

### `authenticateWithRedirect()`

Signs in users via OAuth. This is commonly known as Single Sign On (SSO), where an external account is used for verifying the user's identity.

```typescript
function authenticateWithRedirect(params: AuthenticateWithRedirectParams): Promise<void>
```

#### `AuthenticateWithRedirectParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - <code>[OAuthStrategy](/docs/references/javascript/types/oauth#o-auth-strategy) | 'saml' | 'enterprise\_sso'</code>

  The strategy to use for authentication. The following strategies are supported:

  - `'oauth_<provider>'`: The user will be authenticated with their [social connection account](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview). See a list of [supported values for `<provider>`](/docs/references/javascript/types/oauth#o-auth-provider).
  - `'saml'` (deprecated):  **Deprecated in favor of `'enterprise_sso'`.** The user will be authenticated with their [SAML account](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/overview#saml).
  - `'enterprise_sso'`: The user will be authenticated either through SAML or OIDC depending on the configuration of their [enterprise SSO account](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/overview).

  ---

  - `redirectUrl`
  - `string`

  The full URL or path that the OAuth provider should redirect to, on successful authorization on their part. Typically, this will be a simple `/sso-callback` route that calls [`Clerk.handleRedirectCallback`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/handle-navigation#handle-redirect-callback) or mounts the [`<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />`](/docs/components/control/authenticate-with-callback) component. See the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/oauth-connections) for implementation details.

  ---

  - `redirectUrlComplete`
  - `string`

  The full URL or path that the user will be redirected to once the sign-in is complete.

  ---

  - `identifier`
  - `string | undefined`

    The ID used to target an enterprise connection during sign-in.

  ---

  - `emailAddress`
  - `string | undefined`

  The email address used to target an enterprise connection during sign-in.

  ---

  - `legalAccepted`
  - `boolean | undefined`

  A boolean indicating whether the user has agreed to the [legal compliance](/docs/authentication/configuration/legal-compliance) documents.
</Properties>

### `authenticateWithMetamask()`

Starts a sign-in flow that uses the Metamask browser extension to authenticate the user using their Web3 wallet address. Returns a [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object.

```typescript
function authenticateWithMetamask(): Promise<SignInResource>
```

### `authenticateWithCoinbaseWallet()`

Starts a sign-in flow that uses the Coinbase Wallet to authenticate the user using their Web3 wallet address. Returns a [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object.

```typescript
function authenticateWithCoinbaseWallet(): Promise<SignInResource>
```

### `authenticateWithOKXWallet()`

Starts a sign-in flow that uses the OKX Wallet to authenticate the user using their Web3 wallet address. Returns a [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object.

```typescript
function authenticateWithOKXWallet(): Promise<SignInResource>
```

### `authenticateWithWeb3()`

Starts a sign-in flow that authenticates the user against their Web3 wallet address. Returns a [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object.

```typescript
function authenticateWithWeb3(params: AuthenticateWithWeb3Params): Promise<SignInResource>
```

#### `AuthenticateWithWeb3Params`

<Properties>
  - `identifier`
  - `string`

  The user's Web3 ID.

  ---

  - `generateSignature`
  - `(opts: GenerateSignatureParams) => Promise<string>`

  The method of how to generate the signature for the Web3 sign-in. See [`GenerateSignatureParams`](#generate-signature-params) for more information.

  ---

  - `strategy?`
  - `Web3Strategy`

  The Web3 verification strategy.
</Properties>

##### `GenerateSignatureParams`

<Properties>
  - `identifier`
  - `string`

  The user's Web3 wallet address.

  ---

  - `nonce`
  - `string`

  The [cryptographic nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) used in the sign-in.

  ---

  - `provider?`
  - `Web3Provider`

    The Web3 provider to generate the signature with.
</Properties>

### `authenticateWithPasskey()`

Starts a sign-in flow that allows a user to choose a passkey to sign into their account with. Returns a [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object.

```ts
function authenticateWithPasskey(params?: AuthenticateWithPasskeyParams): Promise<SignInResource>
```

##### `AuthenticateWithPasskeyParams`

<Properties>
  - `flow`
  - `string | undefined`

  Can be `autofill` or `discoverable`
</Properties>

- `'autofill'` enables the client to prompt your users to select a passkey before they interact with your app.
- `'discoverable'` requires the user to interact with the client.
- To call `authenticateWithPasskey()` with no params, you must first call `SignIn.create({ strategy: 'passkey' })`. This is useful if you don't know which sign-in strategy will be used. See the docs for [`SignIn.create()`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in#create) for more information.
