The Clerk Dashboard is where you create your Clerk application and is the central hub for managing your instance's settings, users, organizations, and more.

At the top of the Clerk Dashboard, you will see a few notable features:

- The workspace dropdown: Allows you to switch between [workspaces](#workspaces).
- The application dropdown: Allows you to choose which application you want to manage.
- The instance dropdown: Allows you to switch between your [development and production instances](#instances).
- The [`<UserButton />`](/docs/reference/general/components/user/user-button): Allows you to manage your account and sign out.

We try to make the Clerk Dashboard as intuitive as possible, but if you ever need help or have any feedback, you can always reach out to our [support team](https://clerk.com/support).

## Workspaces

In the Clerk Dashboard, there are two types of workspaces:

- **Personal account**: A personal account/workspace is a user's unique, individual space, independent of any organization.
- **Organization workspace**: An organization workspace is owned and managed by an organization, which can have multiple members, also known as collaborators. The organization workspace that a user is currently viewing is called the [active organization](/docs/guides/organizations/overview#active-organization).

You can switch between workspaces by selecting the workspace dropdown in the top-left of the Clerk Dashboard. This dropdown is actually Clerk's [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/reference/general/components/organization/organization-switcher) component, which you can use in your own application if you choose to use Clerk's organizations feature.

The following sections will walk you through how to use the Clerk Dashboard to create an organization workspace, invite collaborators, and transfer your apps between workspaces.

### Create an organization workspace

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select **Create workspace**. A modal will open.
1. Complete the form. Workspace slugs are unique across all instances, so common naming conventions might already be in use by another instance.
1. Select **Create workspace**. The newly created workspace will be set the active workspace.

### Invite collaborators to your organization workspace

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select **Manage**. You will be redirected to the Team settings page of the active workspace.
1. Select **Invite user**.
1. In the **Invite user** form, enter the email of the user you want to invite and select the role to assign.
1. Select **Invite**.

### Transfer ownership of an application

Transferring an application between two workspaces does not cause disruptions. Your API keys, settings, domains, and other configurations remain unchanged, and your app will continue to function as expected. Only the ownership is updated, so no further action is needed to maintain continuity for existing users.

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), open the workspace dropdown and select the workspace that contains the application you want to transfer.
1. Locate and select the application to transfer.
1. At the top of the Clerk Dashboard, select **Configure**.
1. In the navigation sidenav, under the **Application** heading, select [**Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=settings).
1. Select **Transfer ownership**. A modal will open.
1. Complete the form and select **Transfer ownership**. The page will redirect to the **Applications** page and show the transferred application.

#### Transfer to an org without billing information

**An application with an existing paid subscription can only be transferred to a workspace with active billing information**. You can set up billing information on the receiving workspace without being charged.

To set up a payment method without being charged:

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select the workspace that you want to transfer the application to.
1. Select the workspace dropdown again, and select **Manage**.
1. In the top menu bar, select **Billing**, then select **Upgrade to unlimited members**.
1. Add your billing information. **You will not be charged immediately**. Doing this just ensures billing information is added to the workspace.
1. Once that billing information is added, you will be able to transfer your Clerk app to the receiving workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a temporary solution for this issue. Clerk is actively working to improve this process.

## Instances

When creating a new application within Clerk, you are provided with two instances: `Development` and `Production`. The names are self-explanatory, but you can learn more about the differences between the two in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/development/managing-environments).
