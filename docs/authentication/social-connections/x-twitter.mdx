  - Use X/Twitter v2 to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [X/Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/x/overview) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their X/Twitter account.

Clerk doesn't currently support preconfigured shared OAuth credentials for X/Twitter on development instances. You must provide custom credentials for both development _and_ production instances, which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your X/Twitter Developer account.

## Configure for your production instance

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [X/Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).

> [!WARNING]
> X/Twitter v2 doesn't currently provide users' email addresses. Users must manually enter their email address when they return to your application after authenticating with X/Twitter.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [X/Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).

<Steps>
  ## Enable X/Twitter as a social connection

  To enable X/Twitter as a social connection for your Clerk application:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **X/Twitter**.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ## Create an X/Twitter application

  When signing up for a new X/Twitter Developer account, you'll be required to describe your app's use cases. After completing this step, you'll be redirected to the **Dashboard** page. Under **Projects**, you'll see an automatically generated app with a randomly generated string as its name.

  If you want to create a new X/Twitter application, follow these steps:

  1. In the X/Twitter Developer Portal, under [**Projects**](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps), select **Add App**. You'll be redirected to the **App name** tab. If you have a **Free** account, you can only have one app at a time, so you'll need to delete the existing app before being able to create a new one.
  1. Enter your application name and select **Next**. You'll be redirected to the **Keys & Tokens** tab where your app's credentials are displayed. However, these credentials aren't needed to set up the X/Twitter social connection with Clerk, as the setup uses the OAuth 2.0 flow, which relies on different credentials.
  1. Select **App settings**. You'll be redirected to your app's **Settings** tab.
  1. Under **User authentication settings**, next to **User authentication not set up**, select **Set up**. You'll be redirected to the **User authentication settings** page.
  1. Under **App permissions**, choose the permissions you want to request from your user. At minimum, select the **Read** permission.
  1. Under **Type of App**, select **Web App, Automated App or Bot**.
  1. Under **App info**, in the **Callback URI / Redirect URL** field, paste the **Callback URI / Redirect URL** value you copied from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Complete any other required fields, such as the **Website URL**.
  1. Select **Save**. You'll be redirected to a page that shows your app's **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save these values somewhere secure.

  ## Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ## Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/test-your-connection" />
</Steps>
