## `useAuth()` introduction

[`useAuth()`][use-auth] is a new, SSR-compatible hook that is recommended for all authentication tasks.

```jsx
const {
  userId,
  sessionId,
  getToken,
  isLoaded,
  isSignedIn,
  signOut
} = useAuth();
```

The [`useAuth()`][use-auth] hook unifies the way you access common auth operations. It replaces:

- `useSession()` to access `getToken()` or the `sessionId`
- `useUser()` to access `getToken()` for integrations
- `useClerk()` to access `signOut()`
- `<SignedIn>` and `<SignedOut>` in a way that requires extra components

## Hook and component API changes

Version 3 changes several APIs for improved consistency and usability.

### `useUser()` and `useSession()`

Previously, `useUser` and `useSession` could only be called from inside the `<SignedIn>` component. This restriction has been relaxed, but now developers must manually handle the possibility the user and session objects may not be loaded when the hook is called.

In a future version, we plan to support React `<Suspense />` to make this even easier.

| Old API | New API |
| --- | --- |
| `const user = useUser();` | `const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser();` |
| `const session = useSession();` | `const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, session } = useSession();` <br />If you only call `useSession` for the ID or `getToken`, please switch to [`useAuth()`][use-auth] instead. |

### `<RedirectToSignIn />` and `<RedirectToSignUp/>`

The behavior enabled by the `returnBack` prop has now been promoted to default behavior. `returnBack` is deprecated in favor of using an empty component.

| Old API | New API |
| --- | --- |
| `<RedirectToSignIn returnBack/>` | `<RedirectToSignIn />` |
| `<RedirectToSignUp returnBack/>` | `<RedirectToSignUp />` |

### `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />`

Props which take URLs (absolute or relative) have been standardized to use the Url (camelCase) suffix.

| Old API | New API |
| --- | --- |
| `afterSignIn` | `afterSignInUrl` |
| `afterSignUp` | `afterSignUpUrl` |
| `signUpURL` | `signUpUrl` |
| `signInURL` | `signInUrl` |

### `<UserButton />`

Props which take URLs (absolute or relative) have been standardized to use the Url (camelCase) suffix.

| Old API | New API |
| --- | --- |
| `afterSwitchSession` | `afterSwitchSessionUrl` |
| `userProfileURL` | `userProfileUrl` |
| `signInURL` | `signInUrl` |
| `afterSignOutAll` | `afterSignOutUrl` |
| `afterSignOutOne` | `afterMultiSessionSingleSignOutUrl` |

### `useSignUp()` & `useSignIn()`

`useSignUp()` and `useSignIn()` are no longer required to be contained in `<SignedOut>` or `<ClerkLoaded>`. Instead, they have been updated to include a loading state.

| Old API | New API |
| --- | --- |
| `const signUp = useSignUp();` | `const { isLoaded, signUp } = useSignUp();` |
| `const signIn = useSignIn();` | `const { isLoaded, signIn } = useSignIn();` |

## Resource changes

In order to make our APIs easier to use in codebases not using Typescript and make them more consistent across frameworks, we removed support for snake_cased method parameters. We also updated all method signatures to always accept a param object instead of plain positional params.

We expect that most users will only need to apply these changes to the `user.update()`, `user.createEmailAddress()` and `user.createPhoneNumber()` methods as shown below.

Users who have built custom auth flows using the SignIn and SignUp resources can consult the [SignUp and SignIn section below](#sign-up-and-sign-in).

### User

`User.getToken("token-name")` has been deprecated and is now accessible through `getToken` from the `useAuth()` hook or `Session.getToken()`.

The new `getToken()` method accepts an optional `{ template: string; }` object, used to specify the JWT template you want to use.

Please note that If you want to fetch a token for an integration, you must prefix the integration name with `integration_`, eg: `getToken({ template: 'integration_firebase' })`.

Moreover, the following methods now accept a params objects instead of positional params: `createEmailAddress()`, `createPhoneNumber()`, `setProfileImage()`.

Respecting the camelCase changes we explained at the start of this section, all method params should now use camelCasing. An example for the create method is shown below.

| Old API | New API |
| --- | --- |
| `User.getToken("token-name")` | `const { getToken } = useAuth();` <br />or `getToken({ template: "integration_token-name" })` <br />or `Session.getToken({template: "integration_token-name"})` |
| `User.createEmailAddress(value)` | `User.createEmailAddress({ email: value })` |
| `User.createPhoneNumber(value)` | `User.createPhoneNumber({ phoneNumber: value })` |
| `User.setProfileImage(file)` | `User.setProfileImage(file)` |
| `User.update({ first_name: "", last_name: "" })` | `User.update({ firstName: "", lastName: "" })` |

### SignUp and SignIn

The `createMagicLinkFlow` and `authenticateWithRedirect` calls have had parameters renamed to use the word "redirect" instead of "callback."

| Old API | New API |
| --- | --- |
| `createMagicLinkFlow({ callbackUrl })` | `createMagicLinkFlow({ redirectUrl })` |
| `authenticateWithRedirect({ callbackUrl, callbackUrlComplete })` | `authenticateWithRedirect({ redirectUrl, redirectUrlComplete })` |
