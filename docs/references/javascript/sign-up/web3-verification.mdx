# Web3 verification

These are all methods on the [`SignUp`][signup-ref] class that allow you to verify a user's sign-up request via a web3 wallet.

## `prepareWeb3WalletVerification()`

Helper method that allows you to initiate a verification process for a web3 wallet public address. It sends the public address to the server and expects a nonce that will need to be signed.

This is equivalent to calling [`SignUp.prepareVerification("web3_metamask_signature")`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/verification#prepare-verification).

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function prepareWeb3WalletVerification(): Promise<SignUpResource>;
```

### `prepareWeb3WalletVerification()` returns

| Type | Description |
| - | - |
| `Promise<SignUpResource>` | A `Promise` which resolves to the current [`SignUp`][signup-ref]. |

## `attemptWeb3WalletVerification()`

Helper method that attempts to complete the verification process for a web3 wallet public address.

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function attemptWeb3WalletVerification(params: AttemptWeb3WalletVerificationParams): Promise<SignUp>;
```

This is equivalent to calling [`SignUp.attemptVerification({strategy: "web3_metamask_signature", signature: "..." })`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/verification#attempt-verification).

### `AttemptWeb3WalletVerificationParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `signature` | `string` | The signature that was generated after [`prepareVerification`](#prepare-verification) was called. |
