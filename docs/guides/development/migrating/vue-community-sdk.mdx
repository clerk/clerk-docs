In December 2024, Clerk introduced official support for Vue. This migration guide covers converting from the [`vue-clerk`](https://vue-clerk.vercel.app) community SDK to Clerk's official SDK. It covers the breaking changes that were introduced and provides examples on how to resolve them.

## Installation

Uninstall the community SDK and install Clerk's new official SDK for Vue.

```npm
npm uninstall vue-clerk
npm install @clerk/vue
```

## Breaking changes

### The `useClerk()` composable

The `useClerk()` composable has two important changes:

1. Import path has changed from `vue-clerk` to `@clerk/vue`.
1. The return value is now a Vue [ref](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#ref) containing the Clerk instance.

The key difference is that you now need to use `clerk.value` to access Clerk methods, since the composable returns a reactive ref.

Update your code as follows:

```vue {{ del: [2, 6], ins: [3, 7] }}
<script setup>
import { useClerk } from 'vue-clerk'
import { useClerk } from '@clerk/vue'
const clerk = useClerk()
function signIn() {
  clerk.openSignIn()
  clerk.value.openSignIn()
}
</script>
<template>
  <button @click="signIn">Sign in</button>
</template>
```
