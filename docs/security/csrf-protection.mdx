Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that deceives a victim into submitting a malicious request. The attack inherits the victim's identity and privileges to perform an undesired action on the their behalf. For most sites, browser requests automatically include credentials associated with the site, such as the user's session cookie, IP address, Windows domain credentials, and more. Therefore, if the user is currently authenticated, the site cannot distinguish between a forged request initiated by the attacker and a legitimate request from the user.

[The OWASP® Foundation, Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)

Most CSRF attacks can be protected against by properly configuring the way session tokens are stored. Clerk handles the necessary configuration on your behalf by configuring cookies with the `SameSite` flag.

## What does a CSRF attack look like?

Imagine an attacker made a malicious website at `foo.com` that contained the following code:

```html
<img src="https://www.example.com/?action=delete&id=123" />
```

Notice the query string `?action=delete&id=123`.

If a user logged into `example.com` loads this page, and `example.com` is configured to execute actions from the query string for authorized users, an attacker could potentially delete the user's account on `example.com` without their knowledge. The user would simply see a webpage with a broken image, which could be easily hidden using CSS.

## How does SameSite help prevent CSRF attacks?

Fortunately, [the `SameSite` flag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value), which can be added to the `Set-Cookie` header, can prevent CSRF attacks. In the previous example, if the developers of `example.com` set the `SameSite` flag on their session cookies to `Strict` or `Lax`, the browser would not send the cookie with requests to `foo.com`. Therefore, the attack would fail as the user would not be authenticated and the backend would presumably block the delete action.

Let's break down what each of the values of `SameSite` do:

- `Strict`: The cookie will only be sent with HTTP requests initiated from the same site. While this may seem like the most secure option, it results in users being signed out if they navigate to the site from an external link. Since the cookie is omitted in cross-site requests, this leads to a poor user experience and is generally not recommended when using cookies for authentication.
- `Lax`: The cookie will be sent with HTTP requests initiated from the same site, and with direct navigations from a cross-site origin, but not with requests to load resources such as images or frames. This setting still protects against CSRF attacks without the poor user experience issues of `Strict`, where users are signed out when navigating from external links. `Lax` is the default setting in modern browsers and is recommended for most use cases.
- `None`: The browser will send cookies for both same-site and cross-site requests. While this enables flexibility in certain scenarios, it also opens up the poissibility of CSRF attacks, and therefore is not recommended.

Clerk sets the SameSite flag for all its session cookies to `Lax`, which is the default in modern browsers.

## Do I need to take additional steps to prevent CSRF attacks?

You do not, but it is still possible to accidentally make your application vulnerable to XSS attacks.

Because Clerk uses the _Lax_ setting, it is critical to remember that navigation alone should never trigger a mutation in your backend. Otherwise, the user can be tricked into clicking a link that takes an action they did not intend.
