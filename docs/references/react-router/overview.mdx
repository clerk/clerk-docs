Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your React Router application. This reference lists the features and methods available in Clerk's React Router SDK.

## Client-side helpers

The Clerk React Router SDK is built on top of the [Clerk React SDK](/docs/references/react/overview) and provides access to all of Clerk React's hooks. These hooks give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. Learn more about these hooks in the [React SDK reference](/docs/references/react/overview).
