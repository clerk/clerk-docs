# Change domain or subdomain

Learn how to change your Clerk production instance's domain or subdomain.

<Callout type="Info">
  You cannot change the domain of the [development instance](/docs/deployments/environments#development-instance) of your Clerk application.
</Callout>

## Change domain

1. Update your production domain in two ways:
   - [the Clerk Dashboard](#update-your-domain-via-clerk-dashboard)
   - [Clerk's backend API](#update-your-domain-via-backend-api)
1. Once you make the change to your domain, you will need to update the following:
   - Update DNS records
   - Generate new SSL certificates
   - [Update your publishable key](#updating-your-publishable-key)
   - If using social connections, update the settings with your social connections so that the redirect URL they are using is correct.
   - If using JWT templates, update JWT issuer and JWKS endpoint in external JWT SSO services.

### Update your domain via Clerk Dashboard

To update your production domain in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the navigation sidebar, select **[Domains](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=domains)**.
1. Select the **Danger** tab.
1. Select **Change domain**.

### Update your domain via backend API

To update your production domain using Clerk's backend API, you will need to make a POST request to the `change_domain` endpoint. You will need to provide your new domain in the request body.

1. Copy the following cURL command.

<SignedIn>
  2) Your secret key is required to authenticate the request. It is injected into the cURL command after `Authorization`. However, you can also find it on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of the Clerk Dashboard.
</SignedIn>

<SignedOut>
  2. Your secret key is required to authenticate the request.
     - Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) and sign in.
     - In the navigation sidebar, select **API Keys** to copy your secret key.
     - Paste your secret key into the cURL command after `Authorization`, replacing `sk_...`.
</SignedOut>

3. Replace `YOUR_PROD_URL` with your new production domain.

<InjectKeys>
  ```bash {{ prettier: false }}
  curl -XPOST -H 'Authorization: {{secret}}' -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{
  "home_url": "YOUR_PROD_URL"
  }' 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/instance/change_domain'
  ```
</InjectKeys>

For more information on how to update your instance settings using the backend API, see our [backend API reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Beta-Features#operation/UpdateInstanceAuthConfig).

### Update your publishable key

After changing your domain, a new **Publishable key** will be automatically generated for your application. You will need to update your environment variables with this new key and redeploy your application. You can find your **Publishable key** on the **[API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)** page of the Clerk Dashboard.

<Callout>
  Failing to update your **Publishable key** will result in Clerk failing to load.
</Callout>

## Set, change, or remove subdomain

To set, change, or remove a subdomain for your production instance:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=domains).
1. In the navigation sidebar, select **Domains**.
1. Select the **Danger** tab.
1. You will see the **Change subdomain** section where you can set, change, or remove your subdomain.
