# URL-based session syncing

<Callout type="warning">
  All development instance Clerk apps created after December 6th, 2022 use URL-based session syncing by default, and cannot opt out.
</Callout>

URL-based session syncing (previously known as Cookieless Development mode) configures your frontend and your Clerk Frontend API to communicate information about the current session state via URL decoration.

<Callout type="info">
  This mode only applies to Development Instances. Production instances remain unaffected and continue communicating with Frontend API using first-party, HttpOnly cookies.
</Callout>

## Migrate to URL-based session syncing

For Development instances of Clerk apps created before December 6th, 2022, by default the authentication state of the current session is passed between your frontend (e.g. `localhost:3000`) and your Frontend API (e.g. `clerk.happy.hippo-1.lcl.dev`) via a long-lived third-party cookie.

To opt-in to URL-based session syncing instead, use the following steps:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to your development instance's [Settings](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=settings) page and toggle on **Enable URL-based session syncing**.
   - This toggle is not available in Clerk apps created after December 6th, 2022.
1. In your codebase, upgrade `@clerk/clerk-react` to v4.4.5 or later. If your are importing `@clerk/clerk-js` to your project, use v4.18.0 or later.

## Clerk Account Portal pages and redirects

In URL-based session syncing mode, navigating from your application to your Clerk [Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview) pages must be done using the Clerk redirection helpers and Control Components as shown in the following table:

| Destination page | React component | Helper |
| - | - | - |
| Sign-up | [`<RedirectToSignUp />`](/docs/components/control/redirect-to-signup) | [`Clerk.redirectToSignUp()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/redirect-methods#redirect-to-sign-up) |
| Sign-in | [`<RedirectToSignIn />`](/docs/components/control/redirect-to-signin) | [`Clerk.redirectToSignIn()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/redirect-methods#redirect-to-sign-in) |
| User profile | [`<RedirectToUserProfile />`](/docs/components/control/redirect-to-userprofile) | [`Clerk.redirectToUserProfile()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/redirect-methods#redirect-to-user-profile) |
| Create organization | [`<RedirectToCreateOrganization />`](/docs/components/control/redirect-to-createorganization) | [`Clerk.redirectToCreateOrganization()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/redirect-methods#redirect-to-create-organization) |
| Organization profile | [`<RedirectToOrganizationProfile />`](/docs/components/control/redirect-to-organizationprofile) | [`Clerk.redirectToOrganizationProfile()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/redirect-methods#redirect-to-organization-profile) |

For custom HTML anchors use the Clerk.[`redirectWithAuth`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/redirect-methods#redirect-with-auth) helper:

```jsx {{ prettier: false }}
<a onClick={() => clerk.redirectWithAuth('your_destination_url')}>My link</a>
```
