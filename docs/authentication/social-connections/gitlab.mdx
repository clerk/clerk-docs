  - Use GitLab to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their GitLab account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **GitLab**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your GitLab account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) account.

<Steps>
  ### Enable GitLab as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **GitLab**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create a GitLab app

  1. In [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com), navigate to the [**Applications**](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications) page.
  1. Select **Add new application**.
  1. Enter your app name in **Name**.
  1. In **Redirect URI**, paste the **Redirect URI** you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select the **Scopes** needed for your app. To allow users to sign up and sign in with GitLab, you must at least select `read_user`.
  1. Select **Save application**. You'll be redirected to your app's settings page. Save the **Application ID** and **Secret** somewhere secure.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  1. Navigate back to your Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open. Paste the **Application ID** and **Secret** values in the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** fields, respectively.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the **GitLab** connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal) page.
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:

  - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
  - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`

  1. Sign in with your GitLab account.
