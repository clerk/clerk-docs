Before building your application, it's important to understand the core concepts and objects that drive Clerk's powerful authentication and user management system.

## Components

Clerk offers a comprehensive suite of components designed to seamlessly integrate authentication and multi-tenancy into your application. Components, like `<SignIn />`, `<UserButton />`, and `<OrganizationSwitcher />`, are all-in-one solutions that handle the full lifecycle of the user experience, from sign-up/sign-in to user profile management to organization management.

Out-of-the-box, every Clerk application has the [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview) enabled. The Account Portal uses Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) on dedicated pages that are hosted on Clerk servers.

When you are ready to migrate away from the Account Portal, you simply use Clerk's prebuilt components on your own pages in your application. And don't worry, the prebuilt components are [fully customizable](/docs/customization/overview) to match your application's branding and design.

Furthermore, if the prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can [rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API](/docs/custom-flows/overview). However, this is more advanced and it's recommended to use the prebuilt components whenever possible.

## Configuring your application

Configuring your application is done through the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com). The Clerk Dashboard is where you, as the application owner, can manage your application's settings, users, and organizations. For example, if you want to enable phone number authentication, multi-factor authentication, social providers like Google, delete users, or create organizations, you can do all of this and more in the Clerk Dashboard. You can even invite other users to join your [organization workspace](/docs/organizations/organization-workspaces) and help configure and manage your application with you.

To get started configuring your application, see the [configuration docs](/docs/authentication/overview). There are many guides dedicated to specific configuration options.

## Building your application

The Clerk JavaScript SDK, or ClerkJS, is where Clerk all started. It is the foundational SDK that powers the other JavaScript SDKs, such as the React and Next.js SDKs. The following sections will introduce you to the main objects that power ClerkJS. As you're building your application, you'll likely interact with these objects, either directly or through helpers provided by the other SDKs, like React hooks or Vue composables.

### Clerk

The [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) class is the main entry point for the Clerk JavaScript SDK. All other objects are accessible from the `Clerk` object.

### Client

A client represents the current device or software accessing an application such as your web browser, native application, or Chrome Extension. It is represented by the [`Client`](/docs/references/javascript/client) object.

### Session

A session is a secure representation of the authentication state of the current user. Each client can hold multiple sessions on the same device. It is represented by the [`Session`](/docs/references/javascript/session) object.

### User

The [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user) object represents the current user of the session. It holds all the basic user information such as the user's name, email addresses, and phone numbers, and including their public, private, and unsafe metadata.

### Organization

Organizations are a flexible and scalable way to manage users and their access to resources within your Clerk application. With organizations, you can assign specific roles and permissions to users, making them useful for managing projects, coordinating teams, or facilitating partnerships. Users can belong to many organizations. One of them will be the ["active organization"](/docs/organizations/overview#active-organization) of the session. It is represented by the [`Organization`](/docs/references/javascript/organization) object. To learn about organizations, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/organizations/overview).

### Sign in

The [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object holds the state of the current sign-in and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-in process. It is used to manage the sign-in lifecycle, including the first and second factor verification, and the creation of a new session.

### Sign up

The [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) object holds the state of the current sign-up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-up process. Once a sign-up is complete, a new user is created.
