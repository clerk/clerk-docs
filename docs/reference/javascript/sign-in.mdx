title: '`SignIn`'
description: The SignIn object holds all the state of the current sign in and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign in process.
sdk: js-frontend
---

The `SignIn` object holds the state of the current sign-in and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-in process. It is used to manage the sign-in lifecycle, including the first and second factor verification, and the creation of a new session.

The following steps outline the sign-in process:

1. Initiate the sign-in process by collecting the user's authentication information and passing the appropriate parameters to the [`create()`](#create) method.
1. Prepare the first factor verification by calling [`SignIn.prepareFirstFactor()`](#prepare-first-factor). Users _must_ complete a first factor verification. This can be something like providing a password, an email link, a one-time password ([OTP](!otp)), a Web3 wallet address, or providing proof of their identity through an external social account (SSO/OAuth).
1. Attempt to complete the first factor verification by calling [`SignIn.attemptFirstFactor()`](#attempt-first-factor).
1. Optionally, if you have enabled [multi-factor](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options) for your application, you will need to prepare the second factor verification by calling [`SignIn.prepareSecondFactor()`](#prepare-second-factor).
1. Attempt to complete the second factor verification by calling [`SignIn.attemptSecondFactor()`](#attempt-second-factor).
1. If verification is successful, set the newly created session as the active session by passing the `SignIn.createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object.

## Properties

## Methods

### `attemptFirstFactor()`

Attempts to complete the first factor verification process. This is a required step in order to complete a sign in, as users should be verified at least by one factor of authentication.

Make sure that a `SignIn` object already exists before you call this method, either by first calling [`SignIn.create()`](#create) or [`SignIn.prepareFirstFactor()`](#prepare-first-factor). The only strategy that does not require a verification to have already been prepared before attempting to complete it is the `password` strategy.

Depending on the strategy that was selected when the verification was prepared, the method parameters will be different.

Returns a `SignIn` object. Check the `firstFactorVerification` attribute for the status of the first factor verification process.

```typescript
function attemptFirstFactor(params: AttemptFirstFactorParams): Promise<SignIn>
```

})
```

### `create()`

Creates and returns a new `SignIn` instance initialized with the provided parameters. The instance maintains the sign-in lifecycle state through its `status` property, which updates as the authentication flow progresses. This method serves as the entry point for initiating a sign-in flow.

What you must pass to `params` depends on which [sign-in options](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options) you have enabled in your app's settings in the Clerk Dashboard.

You can complete the sign-in process in one step if you supply the required fields to `create()`. Otherwise, Clerk's sign-in process provides great flexibility and allows users to easily create multi-step sign-in flows.

> [!WARNING]
> Once the sign-in process is complete, pass the `createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object. This will set the newly created session as the active session.

```typescript
function create(params: SignInCreateParams): Promise<SignIn>
```

#### `SignInCreateParams`

  - `'saml'` (deprecated): **Deprecated in favor of `'enterprise_sso'`.** The user will be authenticated with their [SAML account](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/overview#saml).
  - `'enterprise_sso'`: The user will be authenticated either through SAML or OIDC depending on the configuration of their [enterprise SSO account](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/overview).
  - `'reset_password_phone_code'`: Used when the user is trying to reset their password. The user will receive a one-time code via SMS. Requires `phoneNumberId` parameter to be set.
  - `'reset_password_email_code'`: Used when the user is trying to reset their password. The user will receive a one-time code via email. Requires `emailAddressId` parameter to be set.

  ---

  - `emailAddressId?`
  - `string`

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'email_code'` or `'reset_password_email_code'`. The ID for the user's email address that will receive an email with the one-time authentication code.

  ---

  - `phoneNumberId?`
  - `string`

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'phone_code'` or `'reset_password_phone_code'`. The ID for the user's phone number that will receive an SMS message with the one-time authentication code.

  ---

  - `web3WalletId?`
  - `string`

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'web3_base_signature'`, `'web3_metamask_signature'`, `'web3_coinbase_wallet_signature'`, or `'web3_okx_wallet_signature'`. The ID for the user's Web3 wallet address.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The full URL or path that the OAuth provider should redirect to after successful authorization on their part. Typically, this will be a simple `/sso-callback` route that either calls [`Clerk.handleRedirectCallback()`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#handle-redirect-callback) or mounts the [`<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />`](/docs/reference/components/control/authenticate-with-redirect-callback) component. See the [custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/oauth-connections) for implementation details.

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'email_link'`. The full URL that the user will be redirected to when they visit the email link. See the [custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-links) for implementation details.

  ---

  - `actionCompleteRedirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The URL that the user will be redirected to once the first factor verification is complete.
</Properties>

#### Example

```js
const signIn = await clerk.signIn.prepareFirstFactor({
  strategy: 'email_link',
  identifier: 'test@example.com',
})
```

For comprehensive examples, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview).

### `prepareSecondFactor()`

Begins the second factor (2FA) verification process. Clerk calls this [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options#multi-factor-authentication).

> [!NOTE]
> If the `strategy` was set to `totp` (e.g. `SignIn.create({ strategy: 'totp' })`), it does not require preparation. You can directly attempt the second factor verification by calling [`SignIn.attemptSecondFactor`](#attempt-second-factor).

Returns a `SignIn` object. Check the `secondFactorVerification` attribute for the status of the second factor verification process.

```typescript
function prepareSecondFactor(params: PrepareSecondFactorParams): Promise<SignIn>
```

#### `PrepareSecondFactorParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'phone_code'`

  The strategy used for second factor verification. Supported strategies are:

  - `'phone_code'`: User will receive a one-time authentication code via SMS. At least one phone number should be on file for the user.

  ---

  - `phoneNumberId`
  - `string`

  The ID for the user's phone number that will receive an SMS message with the one-time authentication code.
</Properties>

#### Example

```js
const signIn = await clerk.signIn.prepareSecondFactor({
  strategy: 'phone_code',
  phoneNumberId: '123',
})
```

For a comprehensive example, see the [custom flow for multi-factor authentication](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-password-mfa).

### `resetPassword()`

Resets a user's password. It's recommended to use the [custom flow for resetting a user's password](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/account-updates/forgot-password) instead.

```typescript
function resetPassword(params: ResetPasswordParams): Promise<SignIn>
```

#### `ResetPasswordParams`

<Properties>
  - `password`
  - `string`

  The user's current password.

  ---

  - `signOutOfOtherSessions?`
  - `boolean | undefined`

  If `true`, signs the user out of all other authenticated sessions.
</Properties>

#### Example

```js
await clerk.signIn.resetPassword({
  password: 'new-password',
})
```
