Users are able to add multiple phone numbers to their account. Adding a phone number requires the user to verify the phone number before it can be added to the user's account.

This guide demonstrates how to build a custom user interface that allows users to add and verify a phone number for their account.

## Configure phone number verification

To use phone number verification, you first need to enable it for your application.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**User & authentication**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/user-and-authentication) page.
1. Select the **Phone** tab and enable either **Sign-up with phone** or **Sign-in with phone** or both, depending on your application's needs.
