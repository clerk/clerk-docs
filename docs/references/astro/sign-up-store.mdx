# `$signUpStore`

The `$signUpStore` store provides a convenient way to access the [`SignUp`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-up. This is also useful for creating a custom sign-up flow.

## How to use the `$signUpStore` store

### Check the current state of a sign-up

The following example demonstrates how to use the `$signUpStore` store to access the `SignUp` object and check the current state of a sign-up.

```tsx {{ filename: 'sign-up-step.tsx' }}
import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react';
import { $signUpStore } from '@clerk/astro/client';

export default function SignUpStep() {
  const signUp = useStore($signUpStore);

  if (signUp === undefined) {
    // Add logic to handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  // Logic to handle sign up

  return <div>The current sign-up attempt status is {signUp.status}.</div>;
}
```

The possible values for the `status` property of the `SignUp` resource are listed [here](https://clerk.com/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up#properties).

### Create a custom sign-up flow

The `$signUpStore` store can also be used to build fully custom sign-up flows, if Clerk's pre-built components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow. Different sign-up flows include email and password, email and phone codes, email links, and multifactor (MFA). To learn more about using the `$signUpStore` store to create custom flows, check out the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).
