description: Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your TanStack Start application.

Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your TanStack Start application. This documentation covers the capabilities and methods available for Clerk's TanStack SDK.

## Guides

- [Read session and user data](/docs/references/tanstack-start/read-session-data)
- [Add custom sign up and sign in pages](/docs/references/tanstack-start/custom-signup-signin-pages)

## Client-side helpers

Because Clerk TanStack Start is a wrapper around Clerk React, you can utilize the hooks that Clerk React provides. These hooks give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object, and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. You can learn more about these hooks [in the React SDK reference](/docs/references/react/overview).

## Server-side helpers

The below methods and references show how to integrate Clerk features into applications that take advantage of TanStack Start server functions and API routes.

- [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/tanstack-start/get-auth)

### `Auth` object

The `getAuth()` returns an `Auth` object. This JavaScript object contains important information like session data, your user's ID, as well as their organization ID. Learn more about the `Auth` object [here](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object).
