description: Learn how to integrate React into your Clerk application.

The Clerk React SDK is a wrapper around the Clerk JavaScript SDK. It is the recommended way to integrate Clerk into your React application.

> [!WARNING]
> If you are using Next.js, install the `@clerk/nextjs` package, as `@clerk/clerk-react` is incompatible. See the [Next.js](/docs/references/nextjs/overview) documentation for more information.

Clerk React provides React.js implementations of [Clerk components](/docs/components/overview); highly customizable, prebuilt components that you can use to build beautiful user management applications. You can find display components for building [sign-in](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in), [sign-up](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up), [account switching](/docs/components/user/user-button), and [user profile management](/docs/components/user/user-profile) pages as well as flow [control components](/docs/components/control/signed-in) that act as helpers for implementing a seamless authentication experience.

Clerk React provides a suite of [custom hooks](/docs/references/react/use-user). These hooks give you access to the [`Clerk` object](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk), and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up.

## Setting up Clerk React

You need to create a Clerk application in your Clerk Dashboard before you can set up Clerk React. For more information, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).

Once a Clerk application has been created, you can install and start using Clerk React in your application. [The quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/react) will have all the information you need to get started.
