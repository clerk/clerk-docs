  - Use GitHub to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their GitHub account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **GitHub**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for [GitHub's Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/apps).

<Steps>
  ### Enable GitHub as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and choose **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **GitHub**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Authorization Callback URL** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create a GitHub app

  1. In the left sidenav of your [GitHub's Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/apps), select **OAuth Apps**.
  1. Select **New OAuth app**. You'll be redirected to the **Register a new OAuth app** page.
  1. Complete the required fields. In **Authorization Callback URL**, paste the **Authorization Callback URL** you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Register application**. You'll be redirected to your app's **General** page.
  1. Select **Generate a new client secret**. Save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** somewhere secure.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ### Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/test-your-connection" />
