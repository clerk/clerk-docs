  - Use Microsoft Azure Entra ID to authenticate users with OAuth
  - Protect your app from [the nOAuth exploit](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth)
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with Microsoft Azure Entra ID (formerly [Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/new-name)) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Microsoft account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Microsoft**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials. If you already [configured Microsoft as an EASIE connection](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/easie/microsoft), you can skip this step. EASIE SSO will automatically use the credentials you configured for your enterprise connection.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Microsoft as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Microsoft**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Create a Microsoft Entra ID app

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/microsoft/create-app" />

  ### Get your Client ID and Client Secret

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/microsoft/get-client-id-secret" />

  ### Enable OpenID

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/microsoft/enable-openid" />

  ### Secure your app against the nOAuth vulnerability

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/microsoft/noauth" />

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ### Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/test-your-connection" />
</Steps>

## Limitations

- Currently, Clerk supports only the `common` tenant type, which allows sign-ins both from organization members and public Microsoft users.
  - The option to selecting the desired tenant type (`common`, `organizations`, `consumers` or specific tenant ID) will be available in an upcoming version of Clerk.
- Only credentials of type `secret` are supported (not the `certificate` type).

> [!TIP]
> If you're using [SAML with Microsoft](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/saml/azure), the different tenant types _are_ supported, and you can disregard these limitations.
