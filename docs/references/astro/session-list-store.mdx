# `$sessionListStore`

The `$sessionListStore` store returns an array of [`Session`](/docs/references/javascript/session) objects that have been registered on the client device.

## How to use the `$sessionListStore` store

The following example demonstrates how to use the `$sessionListStore` store to retrieve a list of sessions that have been registered on the client device. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state, and the `sessions` property is used to display the number of times the user has visited the page.

```tsx filename="session-list.tsx"
import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react';
import { $sessionList } from '@clerk/astro/client';

export default function Home() {
  const sessions = useStore($sessionList);

  if (sessions === undefined) {
    // handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Welcome back. You have been here
      {sessions.length} times before.
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```
