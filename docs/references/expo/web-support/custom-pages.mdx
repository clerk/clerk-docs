# Build sign in and sign up pages with prebuilt components on web

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) and [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) prebuilt components in order to build custom sign-in and sign-up pages for your Expo web app.

For this guide we will leverage [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) and the [platform-specific extensions](https://docs.expo.dev/router/create-pages/#platform-specific-extensions) to build the sign-in and sign-up pages specifically for the web platform.

<Steps>
### Build a sign-up page

Create a new file `sign-up.web.tsx`, which will be used to render the sign-up page. In the file, import the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component from `@clerk/clerk-expo/web` and render it.

```tsx filename="/app/sign-up.web.tsx"
import { SignUp } from "@clerk/clerk-expo/web";

export default function Page() {
  return <SignUp />;
}
```

### Build a sign-in page

Create a new file `sign-in.web.tsx`, which will be used to render the sign-in page. In the file, import the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component from `@clerk/clerk-expo/web` and render it.


```tsx filename="/app/sign-in.web.tsx"
import { SignIn } from "@clerk/clerk-expo/web";

export default function Page() {
  return <SignIn />;
}
```

### Visit your new pages

Run your project with the following terminal command from the root directory of your project:

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash filename="terminal"
    npm run web
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    yarn web
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    pnpm web
    ```

  </CodeBlockTabs>

Visit your new custom pages locally at [localhost:8081/sign-in](http://localhost:8081/sign-in) and [localhost:8081/sign-up](http://localhost:8081/sign-up).
