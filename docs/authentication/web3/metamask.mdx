  - Use MetaMask to authenticate users with Web3
</TutorialHero>

Enabling [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) as a Web3 provider allows your users to sign in and  up to your Clerk application with their MetaMask wallet.

## Enable MetaMask as a Web3 provider

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Web3**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/web3) page.
1. From the list of web3 providers, enable **MetaMask**.

## Test authentication

The simplest way to test authentication is to visit your Clerk application's [Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk applications out-of-the-box.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal) page.
1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:
   - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
   - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
1. On the sign-in page, you should see **MetaMask** as an option. Use it to sign in.

## Collect additional user information during sign-up (optional)

Web3 applications typically use a hexadecimal wallet address to identify users, which offers a high level of privacy. However, when bridging the gap between Web3 and Web2, it's often necessary to gather human-readable information about the user, such as their email address, phone number, or a username.

To collect additional information about your user during sign-up:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Email, phone, username**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) page.
1. On this page, toggle on attributes you wish to collect from your user during sign up.
1. To set an attribute as required, select the settings icon next to the enabled attribute. Clerk will automatically prompt the user for this information after authenticating with MetaMask.

## Connect MetaMask to existing account

Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to their account at any time through their user profile page. You can configure your application to use the [Account Portal user profile page](/docs/account-portal/overview#user-profile) or the prebuilt [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/components/user/user-profile) component.
