## Enable Billing

To enable Billing for your application, navigate to the [**Billing Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/billing/settings) page in the Clerk Dashboard. This page will guide you through enabling Billing for your application.

Clerk Billing costs the same as using Stripe Billing directly, just 0.7% per transaction, plus transaction fees which are paid directly to Stripe. Clerk Billing is **not** the same as Stripe Billing. Plans and pricing are managed directly through the Clerk Dashboard and won't sync with your existing Stripe products or plans. Clerk uses Stripe **only** for payment processing, so you don't need to set up Stripe Billing.

### Payment gateway

Once you have enabled Billing, you will see the following **Payment gateway** options for collecting payments via Stripe:

- **Clerk development gateway**: A shared **test** Stripe account used for development instances. This allows developers to test and build Billing flows **in development** without needing to create and configure a Stripe account.
- **Stripe account**: Use your own Stripe account for production. **A Stripe account created for a development instance cannot be used for production**. You will need to create a separate Stripe account for your production environment.
