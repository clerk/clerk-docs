How to set up social connection with LinkedIn

## Overview

Adding social connection with LinkedIn to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your LinkedIn account.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a LinkedIn account and a LinkedIn OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a LinkedIn account. To create one, [click here](https://developer.linkedin.com/).

## Configuring LinkedIn social connection

First, you need to create a new OAuth LinkedIn app.

![Creating an OAuth LinkedIn app](/docs/images/authentication-providers/linkedin/148540a6928a19c42d105d50c91bd4a61c1d3326-1096x978.png)

You need to set a name, associate a LinkedIn page with it, and upload a logo for your new application. Go to the [Social Connections page](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=authentication/social) in your Clerk Dashboard and enable LinkedIn. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Paste the value into the **Redirect URL** of your LinkedIn app, as shown below.

![Obtaining the Application ID and Client secret](/docs/images/authentication-providers/linkedin/c3532a2089d98362370241bc43355e95035555da-1089x837.png)

The last thing you have to do is to enable the *Sign in with LinkedIn* product for your OAuth application.

![Enable Sign In with LinkedIn product](/docs/images/authentication-providers/linkedin/9b2aae3fa3612dd7ae3b982b2c5a7e1d41409d49-1064x765.png)

Copy the **Application ID** and **Secret** from the previous screen. Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with LinkedIn is now configured for your instance.
