The parameters for the `setActive()` method.

<Properties>
  - `session`
  - <code>[Session](/docs/reference/javascript/session) | string | null</code>

  The session resource or session ID (string version) to be set as active. If `null`, the current session is deleted.

  ---

  - `organization`
  - <code>[Organization](/docs/reference/javascript/organization) | string | null</code>

  The Organization resource or Organization ID/slug (string version) to be set as active in the current session. If `null`, the currently [Active Organization](!active-organization) is removed as active.

  ---

  - `beforeEmit?` (deprecated)
  - `(session?: Session | null) => void | Promise<any>`

  Deprecated in favor of `redirectUrl`. Callback run just before the active session and/or Organization is set to the passed object. Can be used to set up for pre-navigation actions.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl?`
  - `string`

  The full URL or path to redirect to just before the active session and/or Organization is set.

  ---

  - `navigate?`
  - `(opts: { session: SessionResource; decorateUrl: (url: string) => string }) => Promise<unknown>`

  A custom navigation function to be called just before the session and/or Organization is set. When provided, it takes precedence over the `redirectUrl` parameter for navigation.

  The callback receives:

  - `session`: The new active session
  - `decorateUrl`: A function that wraps your destination URL to enable Safari ITP cookie refresh when needed. **Always use this to wrap your destination URLs.** [Learn more about this function and Safari ITP cookie refresh](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#using-the-navigate-parameter).
</Properties>
