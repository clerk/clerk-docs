## Set up Clerk as a Convex third-party auth provider

For your Clerk session token to work with Convex, you need to set up the Convex integration in Clerk.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [Convex integration setup](https://dashboard.clerk.com/apps/setup/convex).
1. Choose your configuration options, and then select **Activate Convex integration**. This will reveal the [Frontend API URL](!frontend-api-url) for your Clerk instance.
1. Save the URL. In development, its format is `https://verb-noun-00.clerk.accounts.dev`. In production, its format is `https://clerk.<your-domain>.com`.

## Map additional claims (optional)

In the **Claims** section, the default audience (`aud`) claim required by Convex is pre-mapped. You can include additional claims as necessary. [Shortcodes](/docs/guides/sessions/jwt-templates#shortcodes) are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.

## Configure Convex with Clerk's Frontend API URL

1. In your `env` file, add your [Frontend API URL](!frontend-api-url) as the `CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL` environment variable. If this has already been configured, you can proceed to the next step.
   ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
   CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL={{fapi_url}}
   ```
1. In your app's `convex` folder, create a `auth.config.ts` file with the following configuration:
   ```ts {{ filename: 'convex/auth.config.ts' }}
   export default {
     providers: [
       {
         domain: process.env.CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL,
         applicationID: 'convex',
       },
     ],
   }
   ```

## Deploy your changes to Convex

Run `npx convex dev` to automatically sync your configuration to your backend.
