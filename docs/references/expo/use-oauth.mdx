## Returns

<Properties>

  - `boolean`

  Indicates if there are any credentials stored on the device.

  Indicates the supported enrolled biometric authenticator type.

  ---

  - `setCredentials()`
  - <code>(params: [LocalCredentials](#local-credentials)) => Promise\<void></code>

  Stores the provided credentials on the device if the device has enrolled biometrics. The end user needs to have a passcode set in order for the credentials to be stored, and those credentials will be removed if the passcode gets removed. The promise will reject if the value cannot be stored on the device.

  ---

  - `clearCredentials()`
  - <code>() => Promise\<void></code>

  Removes the stored credentials from the device. The promise will reject if the value cannot be deleted from the device.

  ---

  - `authenticate()`
  - <code>() => Promise\<[SignInResource](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in)></code>

  Attempts to read the stored credentials and creates a sign-in attempt with the password strategy.The promise will resolve to a `SignInResource` if the stored credentials were accessed. Otherwise, the promise will reject.
</Properties>

### `LocalCredentials`

<Properties>
  - `identifier`
  - `string?`

  The identifier of the credentials to be stored on the device. It can be a username, email, phone number, etc.

  ---

  - `password`
  - `string`

  The password for the identifier to be stored on the device. If an identifier already exists on the device, passing only `password` would update the password for the stored identifier.
