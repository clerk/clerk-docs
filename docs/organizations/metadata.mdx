title: Organization metadata
description: Organization objects hold a set of metadata that can be used internally to store arbitrary information.
---

Organization metadata allows you to store information about an organization that is not part of the standard fields, such as custom attributes that are specific to your application.

There are two types of metadata: **public** and **private**.

Both public and private metadata are set and can be accessed from the [Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api). Only public metadata can be accessed from the [Frontend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/frontend-api/).

Both the `Organization` and `Organization Membership` objects have the metadata fields: `publicMetadata` and `privateMetadata`.

The `publicMetadata` property should be used if you need to set some metadata from your backend and have them displayed as read-only on the frontend.

The `privateMetadata` property should be used if custom attributes contain sensitive information that should not be displayed on the frontend.

## Set organization metadata

To ease the flow of setting metadata, Clerk provides the `updateOrganizationMetadata()` and `updateOrganizationMembershipMetadata()` methods from the [Backend SDK](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api), which is a wrapper around the [Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api).
