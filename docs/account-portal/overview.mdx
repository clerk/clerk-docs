# Introduction

The Account Portal offers a comprehensive solution for managing user authentication and profile management in your web application and is the fastest way to add Clerk's authentication to your application with minimal code required.

## How the Account Portal works

The Account Portal uses our Clerk components embedded on dedicated pages hosted for your application and users are automatically redirect to and from your application for a seamless authentication experience.

For every instance, Clerk offers sign-up, sign-in, and user profile pages out of the box. Additionally, if you are using our Organizations feature, you will also get the organization profile page.
You can access these links via the 'pages' tab under Account Portal in your Clerk dashboard.

 
For development instances, Clerk will issue you a domain on "lcl.dev". In production, by default, the URLs for your Account Portal are the following: 

```sh 
https://accounts.[your-domain].com/sign-in
https://accounts.[your-domain].com/sign-up
https://accounts.[your-domain].com/user
https://accounts.[your-domain].com/organization
https://accounts.[your-domain].com/create-organization
``` 


## Getting Started  

To use the Account Portal in your application, you simply need to Install Clerk into your application and protect your pages. Clerk will take care of the redirection for your users automatically.
