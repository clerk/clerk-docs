# Session methods

These methods on the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) class help you manage the active session and/or organization.

## `setActive()`

A method used to set the active session and/or organization.

```typescript
function setActive({
  session,
  organization,
  beforeEmit,
}: SetActiveParams): Promise<void>;
```

### `SetActiveParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session?` | [`Session`](/docs/references/javascript/session) \| `string` \| `null` | The session resource or session ID (string version) to be set as active. If `null`, the current session is deleted. |
| `organization?` | [`Organization`](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) \| `string` \| `null` | The organization resource or organization ID (string version) to be set as active in the current session. If `null`, the currently active organization is removed as active. |
| `beforeEmit?` | `(session?: Session \| null) => void \| Promise<any>` | Callback run just before the active session and/or organization is set to the passed object. Can be used to hook up for pre-navigation actions. |

### Example

The `setActive()` method is most commonly used when building a [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview) for your application.

For example, during authentication, when a user signs in or signs up successfully, a new session is created. `setActive()` needs to be used to set the new session as the active session. See the implementation of this in the [Custom authentication flow](/docs/custom-flows/use-sign-up) guide.

Another example is when a user switches organizations in a multi-organization application. `setActive()` needs to be used to set the new organization as the active organization. See the implementation of this in the [Custom organization switcher](/docs/organizations/custom-organization-switcher) guide.
