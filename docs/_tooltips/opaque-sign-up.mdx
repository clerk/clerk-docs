An **opaque sign up** refers to a specific OAuth authentication flow where a user attempts to sign in via OAuth (like Google, GitHub, etc.) with an email address that doesn't exist in your application's user database. The term "opaque" here means that the sign-up process is transparent to the user - they think they're signing in, but Clerk is actually [creating a new account behind the scenes](!transfer-flow).
