description: Use Clerk's Backend SDK to mark a user as locked, which means they are not allowed to sign in again until the lock expires.
---

{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/api/endpoints/UserApi.ts#L263 */}

Marks the given [`User`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-user) as locked, which means they are not allowed to sign in again until the lock expires.

By default, lockout duration is 1 hour, but it can be configured in the application's [**Attack protection**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/attack-protection) settings. For more information, see the [dedicated guide for customizing **Attack protection** settings](/docs/security/customize-user-lockout).

```ts
function lockUser(userId: string): Promise<User>
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `userId`
  - `string`

  The ID of the user to lockout.
</Properties>

## Example

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

```tsx
const userId = 'user_123'

const response = await clerkClient.users.lockUser(userId)
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `POST/users/{user_id}/lock`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/LockUser){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
