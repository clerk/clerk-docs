The `<ClerkFailed>` component indicates that the Clerk object has failed to load. This is useful for displaying an error message to the user.

## Usage

It's not recommended to wrap the entire app in the `<ClerkFailed>` component; instead, only wrap the components that need access to the `Clerk` object.

<Include src="_partials/control-components-without-expo" />
