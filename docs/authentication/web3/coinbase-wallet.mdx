Learn how to quickly and easily enable secure [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) authentication and user management for your web3 application with Clerk.

> [!NOTE]
> This page specifically focuses on integrating Coinbase Wallet for Web3 applications. If you are looking to connect users via Coinbase.com, please use the Coinbase social connection instead.

## Overview

Adding [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) authentication to your Clerk instance is straightforward and requires just one step.

Both [Smart Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet/smart-wallet) and the [Coinbase Wallet browser extension](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet/downloads) are supported.

## Before you start

You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).

## Enabling Coinbase Wallet authentication

In your Clerk dashboard, go to **Configure**, then **User & Authentication** > **Web3**.

From the list of web3 providers, toggle on **Coinbase Wallet**.

Congratulations! Authentication with Coinbase Wallet is now configured for your instance.

Yes, it really is that easy!

To test authentication with Coinbase Wallet, open your application’s sign-in page, or, if you haven’t started building with Clerk yet, you can use Clerk Account Portal for convenience.

To do so, head to **Configure** then **Customization** > **Account Portal**.

Copy then navigate to the **Sign-in** link.

On this page, you will find your [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component rendered with all the authentication options enabled for your instance, including Coinbase Wallet.

## Collecting additional identifiers during sign-up

Web3 applications typically utilize a hexadecimal wallet address to identify users, which offers a high level of privacy. However, when bridging the gap between Web3 and Web2, it’s often necessary to
gather identifiable information about the user, such as their email address, phone number, or perhaps just a human-readable username.

To collect additional information about your user during sign-up, go to the **Configure** section of your Clerk dashboard then **User & Authentication** > **Email, phone, username**.

On this page, toggle on attributes you wish to collect from your user during sign-up.

When you mark any of these attributes as required, Clerk automatically prompts the user for this information after they authenticate with Coinbase Wallet.

## Connecting Coinbase Wallet after sign up

Once you enable Coinbase Wallet for your instance, your users will have the ability to connect their Coinbase Wallet even after they have signed up.

To guide your users in connecting their Coinbase Wallet to their existing account, direct them to the [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/components/user/user-profile) component.

In the **Profile** tab, they will find a **Connect Wallet** button at the bottom. Clicking this will open the options for linking additional authentication methods. From the available options, users can select the Coinbase Wallet to complete the connection.
