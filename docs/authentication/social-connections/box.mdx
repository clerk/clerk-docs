  - Use Box to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with Box allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Box account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Box**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials, which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your Box account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Box as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Box**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Create a Box app

  1. On the homepage of the [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console), select **Custom App**. A modal will open.
  1. Fill out the necessary information. Use Box's [guide on OAuth 2.0 setup](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/oauth2/oauth2-setup/#app-creation-steps) to help you.
  1. Select **Next**.
  1. In the list of authentication methods, select **User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)**.
  1. Select **Create App**. You'll be redirected to the app's configuration page.
  1. In the **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URIs** section, paste the **Redirect URI** value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. In the **OAuth 2.0 Credentials** section, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** somewhere secure. You'll need them to connect your Box app to your Clerk app.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open. Paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the **Box** connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal) page.
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:

  - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
  - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`

  1. Sign in with your Box account.
