description: Learn how to manage user access to your application by configuring Clerk's access restrictions.
---

Clerk provides restriction options that give you enhanced control over who can access your application. These options enable you to limit sign-ups, sign-ins, or prevent accounts with specific [identifiers](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#identifiers), such as email addresses, phone numbers, and even entire domains, from accessing your application.

## Sign-up modes

Clerk supports multiple sign-up modes, giving you flexibility in managing user access to your application.

To configure sign-up modes:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/restrictions).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **Restrictions**.
1. Under the **Sign-up modes** section, you can enable one of the following options:
   - **[Public](#public)**
   - **[Restricted](#restricted)**
   - **[Waitlist](#waitlist)**

### Public

In **Public** mode, the sign-up process is open to anyone. This mode is ideal for applications that want broad user access.

### Restricted

In **Restricted** mode, user access is controlled by the application admin(s). Users can be added to the application through [invitations](/docs/users/invitations) or [manual user creation](/docs/users/creating-users). This mode is ideal for applications that are in private beta or internal tools.

Additional features available in **Restricted** mode:

- The [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component will keep the prompt to sign up hidden by default. This is to avoid confusion for users who don't have access.

- The [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) is accessible only to users who have been invited and have a valid invitation link. Users who don't have access will see a message indicating that they need an invitation to sign up.

### Waitlist

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using Next.js, the`<Waitlist />` component is available in `@clerk/nextjs\@6.2.0` and above.

In **Waitlist** mode, users can register their interest in your application by joining a waitlist. This mode is ideal for applications in early development stages or those wanting to generate interest before launch.

Additional features available in **Waitlist** mode:

- The [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component will only be accessible to users who have been approved from the waitlist.

- The [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) is accessible only to users who have been invited and have a valid invitation link. Users who don't have access will see a message indicating that they need an invitation to sign up.

- The [`<Waitlist />`](/docs/components/waitlist/overview) component provides a form where users can submit their details to join the waitlist. Once approved by admins, users will receive an email with access instructions.

- If you're using the `<Waitlist />` component, you must provide the `waitlistUrl` prop either in the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider#properties) or [`<SignIn />`](docs/components/authentication/sign-in#properties) component to ensure proper functionality.

## Allowlist

> [!NOTE]
> Allowlist is a premium feature and is not available on the Free plan. [Upgrade your plan](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} to enable this feature.

By adding specific identifiers to the allowlist, _only_ users with those identifiers will be able to sign up or sign in to your application, while others will be blocked. This is useful for internal tools, where you want to allow only users with your company domain to have access to the application.

After creating an account, users cannot change their identifier to bypass the allowlist, making this feature a secure way to control who can access your application. For example, if you add `clerk.dev` as an allowed email domain, any user with a `@clerk.dev` email address can sign up for your application. Email addresses from different domains will not be able to sign up.

To enable this feature:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/restrictions).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **Restrictions**.
1. In the **Allowlist** section, toggle on **Enable allowlist**.

> [!CAUTION]
> Enabling the Allowlist without adding any identifier exceptions blocks _all_ sign-ins and sign-ups.

## Blocklist

> [!NOTE]
> Blocklist is a premium feature and is not available on the Free plan. [Upgrade your plan](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} to enable this feature.

By adding specific identifiers to the blocklist, users with those identifiers will be blocked from signing up for your application. This is useful for attack prevention, such as when multiple spam accounts sign up for your application. For example, if you add `clerk.dev` as a blocked email domain, it means that anybody with a `@clerk.dev` email address will not be able to sign up for your application.

To enable this feature:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/restrictions).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **Restrictions**.
1. In the **Blocklist** section, toggle on **Enable blocklist**.

> [!WARNING]
> In the case that you have enabled the allowlist and the blocklist and have added the same identifier in both, the allowlist takes precedence.

For additional security, adding an individual email address to the blocklist will also block any attempts to sign up with the email address modified to contain a subaddress. Subaddresses are identified by the presence of any of the following characters in the local part of the email address: `+`, `#`, `=`.

For example, if you add `john.doe@clerk.dev` as a blocked email address, it means that anybody with `john.doe@clerk.dev` email address will not be able to sign up for your application, including `john.doe+anything@clerk.dev` and any other subaddress.

## Block email subaddresses

**Block email subaddresses** allows you to block all email addresses that contain the characters `+`, `=` or `#` from signing up or being added to existing accounts. For example, an email address like `user+sub@clerk.com` will be blocked.

> [!NOTE]
> Existing accounts with email subaddresses will not be affected by this restriction, and will still be allowed to sign in.
>
> This feature is designed to prevent malicious sign-in attempts. The first email containing a subaddress will be allowed, but any subsequent sign-ins using additional subaddresses will be blocked.

To enable this feature:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/restrictions).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **Restrictions**.
1. In the **Restrictions** section, toggle on **Block email subaddresses**.

### Block sign-ups that use disposable email addresses

**Block disposable email addresses** allows you to block all email addresses that are _known to be disposable_ from signing up for your application. This is useful to prevent spam accounts from signing up.

To enable this feature:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/restrictions).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **Restrictions**.
1. In the **Restrictions** section, toggle on **Block sign-ups that use disposable email addresses**.
