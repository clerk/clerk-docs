# `auth()`

The `auth()` helper returns the [`Auth`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object) object of the currently active user. This is the same `Auth` object that is returned by the [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) hook. However, it can be used in Server Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions.

The `auth()` helper does require [Middleware](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware).

## Returns

`auth()` returns the [`Auth`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object) object with a few extra properties:

- [`protect()`](#protect)
- [`redirectToSignIn()`](#redirect-to-sign-in)

### `protect()`

<Callout type="warning">
  `auth().protect()` only works for App Router and is considered experimental.
</Callout>

You can use the `protect()` helper in two ways:

- to check if a user is authenticated (signed in)
- to check if a user is authorized (has the correct roles or permissions) to access something, such as a component or a route handler

The following table describes how the `protect()` helper behaves based on user authentication or authorization status:

| Authenticated | Authorized | `protect()` will |
| - | - | - |
| Yes | Yes | Return the [`Auth`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object) object. |
| Yes | No | Return a `404` error. |
| No | No | Redirect the user to the sign-in page\*. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> \*For non-document requests, such as API requests, `protect()` returns a `404` error to users who aren't authenticated.

`protect()` accepts the following parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `role?` | `string` | The role to check for. |
| `permission?` | `string` | The permission to check for. |
| `has?` | <code>(isAuthorizedParams: CheckAuthorizationParamsWithCustomPermissions) => boolean</code> | A function that returns a boolean based on the permission or role provided as parameter. Can be used for authorization. See the dedicated [`has()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#has) section for more information. |
| `unauthorizedUrl?` | `string` | The URL to redirect the user to if they are not authorized. |
| `unauthenticatedUrl?` | `string` | The URL to redirect the user to if they are not authenticated. |

For more information on how to use `protect()`, see the [examples](#use-auth-to-check-if-a-user-is-authenticated) in this guide. There are also examples in the [Verify user permissions](/docs/organizations/verify-user-permissions) guide.

### `redirectToSignIn()`

`redirectToSignIn()` is a method that redirects the user to the sign-in page. It accepts the following parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `returnBackUrl?` | `string \| URL` | The URL to redirect the user back to after they sign in. |

<Callout type="info">
  `auth()` on the server-side can only access redirect URLs defined via [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) or [`clerkMiddleware` dynamic keys](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#dynamic-keys).
</Callout>

## Use `auth()` to retrieve `userId`

You can use `auth()` to check if a `userId` exists. If it does not, that means there is no user signed in. You can use this information to protect pages, as shown in the following example:

```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

export default function Page() {
  const { userId } : { userId: string | null } = auth();

  if (!userId) return null;

  return <h1>Hello, {userId}</h1>;
}
```

## Use `auth()` for data fetching

When using a Clerk integration, or if you need to send a JWT along to a server, you can use the `getToken()` function that is returned by `auth()`.

```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'app/api/example/route.ts' }}
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

export async function GET() {
  const {userId, getToken} = auth();

  if(!userId){
    return new Response("User is not signed in.", { status: 401 });
  }

  try {
    const token = await getToken({template: "supabase"});

    // Add logic here to fetch data from Supabase and return it.

    const data = { supabaseData: 'Hello World' };

    return Response.json({ data });
  } catch (error) {
    return Response.json(error);
  }
}
```

## Use `auth()` to check if a user is authenticated

`auth().protect()` can be used in a `layout.tsx` file to protect the entire route, including all children.

In the following example,

- the `protect()` helper is used to check if a user visiting any `/dashboard` route is authenticated.
- If the user is not authenticated, they will be redirected to the sign-in route.
- If the user is authenticated, they can view any `/dashboard` route and its children.

```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'app/dashboard/layout.tsx' }}
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default async function Layout({ children }:{ children: React.ReactNode }){
  auth().protect()

  return <>{children}</>
}
```

## Use `auth()` to check if a user is authorized

`auth()` returns the [`Auth`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#auth-object) object, which includes the [`has()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#has) helper. `auth()` also returns the `protect()` helper.

You can protect certain parts of your application or even entire routes based on user authorization status by checking if the user has the required roles or permissions.

- Use `protect()` if you want Clerk to return a `404` if the user does not have the role or permission.
- Use `has()` if you want more control over what your app does based on the authorization status instead of immediately returning a `404`.

<Tabs items={["has()", "protect()"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example uses `has()` to protect a pages content from unauthorized access.

    - If the user does not have the permission, `has()` will return `false`, causing the component to return `null`.
    - If the user has the permission, `has()` will return `true`, allowing the component to render its children.

    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'app/team-settings/page.tsx' }}
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

    export default async function Page() {
      const { has } = auth();

      const canManage = has({ permission:"org:team_settings:manage" });

      if(!canManage) return null;

      return <h1>Team Settings</h1>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    > [!WARNING]
    > `auth().protect()` only works for App Router and is considered experimental.

    The following example uses `protect()` to protect a Next.js Route Handler from unauthenticated and unauthorized access.

    - If the user is not authenticated, `protect()` will redirect the user to the sign-in route.
    - If the user is authenticated but is not authorized (as in, does not have the `org:team_settings:manage` permission), `protect()` will throw a `404` error.
    - If the user is both authenticated and authorized, `protect()` will return the user's `userId`.

    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'app/api/create-team/route.ts' }}
    import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

    export const POST = () => {
      const { userId } = auth().protect({ permission: "org:team_settings:manage" });

      return users.createTeam(userId);
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Use `auth()` to check your current user's role

In some cases, you need to check your user's current organization role before displaying data or allowing certain actions to be performed.

Check the current user's role with the `orgRole` property of the `Auth` object returned by `auth()`, as shown in the following example:

```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

export default async function Page() {
  const { orgRole } = auth();

  return (
    <>
      <div>Your current role is {orgRole}</div>
    </>
  )
}
```
