1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**User & authentication**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/user-and-authentication) page.
1. Enable **Sign-up with email**.
   - **Require email address** should be enabled.
   - For **Verify at sign-up**, **Email verification code** is enabled by default, and is used for this guide. If you'd like to use **Email verification link** instead, see the [dedicated custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-links).
1. Enable **Sign in with email**.
   - This guide supports password authentication. If you'd like to build a custom flow that allows users to sign in passwordlessly, see the [email code custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-sms-otp) or the [email links custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-links).
1. Select the **Password** tab and enable **Sign-up with password**.
   - [**Client Trust**](/docs/guides/secure/client-trust) is enabled by default. The sign-in example supports it using email verification codes because it's the default second factor strategy.
