## How to use the `useSessionList()` composable

### Get a list of sessions

The following example uses `useSessionList()` to get a list of sessions that have been registered on the client device. The `sessions` property is used to show the number of times the user has visited the page.

```vue {{ filename: 'SessionList.vue' }}
<script setup>
import { useSessionList } from '@clerk/vue'

const { isLoaded, sessions } = useSessionList()
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">
    <!-- Handle loading state -->
  </div>

  <div v-else>
    <p>Welcome back. You've been here {{ sessions.length }} times before.</p>
  </div>
</template>
```
