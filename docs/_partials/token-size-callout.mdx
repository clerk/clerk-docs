> [!CAUTION]
> **It's recommended to keep the total size of custom claims in the session token under 1.2KB.** Exceeding this size can have adverse effects, including a possible infinite redirect loop for users who exceed this size in Next.js applications. It's recommended to move particularly large claims out of the JWT and fetch these using a separate API call from your backend.
