{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/api/endpoints/OrganizationApi.ts#L187 */}

Creates a membership to an Organization for a user directly (circumventing the need for an invitation). Returns a [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization-membership) object.

```ts
function createOrganizationMembership(
  params: CreateOrganizationMembershipParams,
): Promise<OrganizationMembership>
```

## `CreateOrganizationMembershipParams`

<Properties>
  - `organizationId`
  - `string`

  The ID of the Organization the user is being added to.

  ---

  - `userId`
  - `string`

  The ID of the user to be added to the Organization.

  ---

  - `role`
  - `string`

  The [Role](/docs/guides/organizations/roles-and-permissions) to assign the added user within the Organization.
</Properties>

## Example

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

In the following example, an [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization-membership) is created for a user with the Role `org:member`.

```tsx
const organizationId = 'org_123'

const userId = 'user_123'

const role = 'org:member'

const response = await clerkClient.organizations.createOrganizationMembership({
  organizationId,
  userId,
  role,
})
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `POST/organizations/{organization_id}/memberships`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/organization-memberships/post/organizations/\{organization_id}/memberships){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
