The `<RedirectToTasks />` component will redirect users to Clerk's prebuilt session task flow when they have pending [session tasks](!session-tasks). This behavior is similar to a server-side (3xx) redirect, and will override the current location in the history stack.

The prebuilt session task flow is hosted through Clerk's [Account Portal](/docs/guides/account-portal/overview#sign-in). For example, if the user has a pending `choose-organization` task, they will be redirected to the `/tasks/choose-organization` Account Portal page. If you don't want to use the prebuilt components or Account Portal, you can build a [custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/session-tasks).

## Example

Your sign-up/sign-in flow should handle session tasks, but if a user's authentication flow is interrupted and they aren't able to complete the tasks, you can use the `<RedirectToTasks />` component to redirect them to the appropriate task page.

By default, the `<RedirectToTasks />` component will redirect to the `/sign-in/tasks/<task-key>` URL path, expecting [the `<SignIn />` component to be hosted on the `/sign-in` route](/docs/guides/development/custom-sign-in-or-up-page). If it is, great, the `<SignIn />` component will handle the session task flows. However, if you want to customize the paths where specific tasks are redirected, you can [use the `taskUrls` option](/docs/guides/configure/session-tasks#using-the-task-urls-option).

In the following example, the `<RedirectToTasks />` component is used to protect a page. Users can't access this page until they complete their pending session tasks. You can also wrap your entire application in the `<RedirectToTasks />` component, or place it in your application's layout file, so that users can't access any of your app until they complete their pending session tasks.
