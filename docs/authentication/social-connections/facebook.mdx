  - Use Facebook to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with Facebook allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Facebook account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Facebook**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Facebook Developer](https://developers.facebook.com) page.

<Steps>
  ### Enable Facebook as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Facebook**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Create a Facebook app

  1. In the top-right of the Facebook Developer page, select [**My Apps**](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).
  1. In the top-right, select **Create App**. You'll be redirected to the **Create an app** process.
     1. In the **App details** step, fill out the necessary information and select **Next**.
     1. In the **Use Cases** step, select **Authenticate and request data from users with Facebook Login** and then select **Next**.
     1. In the **Business** step, select the business portfolio to connect to your app and then select **Next**.
     1. In the **Finalize** step, select **Go to dashboard**. You'll be redirected to the app's **Dashboard** page.
  1. In the left sidenav, select **Use cases**.
  1. Next to **Authenticate and request data from users with Facebook Login**, select **Customize**. You'll be redirected to the **Permissions** tab of the **Customize use case** page.
  1. Next to **email**, select **Add**. This permission allows Clerk to read your user's primary email address.
  1. In the left sidenav, under **Facebook Login**, select **Settings**.
  1. In the **Client OAuth settings** section, in the **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** field, paste the **Redirect URI** value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Save changes**.
  1. In the left sidenav, select **App settings** (hover over the settings icon to view the title or expand the menu), and then select **Basic**.
  1. Save the **App ID** and **App Secret** somewhere secure.

  ### Set the App ID and App Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open. Paste the **App ID** and **App Secret** values that you saved into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the values into their respective fields.
