title: Read session and user data in your Next.js app with Clerk
description: Learn how to use Clerk's hooks and helpers to access the active session and user data in your Next.js application.
---

Clerk provides a set of [hooks and helpers](/docs/references/nextjs/overview#client-side-helpers) that you can use to access the active session and user data in your Next.js application. Here are examples of how to use these helpers in both the client and server-side to get you started.

## Server-side

### App Router

[`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) and [`currentUser()`](/docs/references/nextjs/current-user) are App Router-specific helpers that you can use inside of your Route Handlers, Middleware, Server Components, and Server Actions.

- The `auth()` helper will return the [`Auth`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object) object of the currently active user.
- The `currentUser()` helper will return the [`Backend User`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-user) object of the currently active user, which includes helpful information like the user's name or email address. **It does count towards the [Backend API request rate limit](/docs/backend-requests/resources/rate-limits)** so it's recommended to use the [`useUser()`](/docs/hooks/use-user) hook on the client side when possible and only use `currentUser()` when you specifically need user data in a server context. For more information on this helper, see the [`currentUser()`](/docs/references/nextjs/current-user) reference.

The following example uses the [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) helper to validate an authenticated user and the `currentUser()` helper to access the `Backend User` object for the authenticated user.

> [!NOTE]
> Any requests from a Client Component to a Route Handler will read the session from cookies and will not need the token sent as a Bearer token.

<Tabs items={["Server components and actions", "Route Handler"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
    import { auth, currentUser } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default async function Page() {
      // Get the userId from auth() -- if null, the user is not signed in
      const { userId } = await auth()

      // Protect the route by checking if the user is signed in
      if (!userId) {
        return <div>Sign in to view this page</div>
      }

      // Get the Backend API User object when you need access to the user's information
      const user = await currentUser()

      // Use `user` to render user details or create UI elements
      return <div>Welcome, {user.firstName}!</div>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/api/user/route.ts' }}
    import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'
    import { currentUser, auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export async function GET() {
      // Use `auth()` to get the user's ID
      const { userId } = await auth()

      // Protect the route by checking if the user is signed in
      if (!userId) {
        return new NextResponse('Unauthorized', { status: 401 })
      }

      // Use `currentUser()` to get the Backend API User object
      const user = await currentUser()

      // Add your Route Handler's logic with the returned `user` object

      return NextResponse.json({ user: user }, { status: 200 })
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Pages Router

For Next.js applications using the Pages Router, the [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) helper will return the [`Auth`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object) object of the currently active user, which contains important information like the current user's session ID, user ID, and organization ID. The `userId` can be used to protect your API routes.

In some cases, you may need the full [`Backend User`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-user) object of the currently active user. This is helpful if you want to render information, like their first and last name, directly from the server.

The `clerkClient()` helper returns an instance of the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview), which exposes Clerk's Backend API resources through methods such as the [`getUser()`](/docs/references/backend/user/get-user){{ target: '_blank' }} method. This method returns the full `Backend User` object.

In the following example, the `userId` is passed to the Backend SDK's `getUser()` method to get the user's full `Backend User` object.

  <Tab>
    <Include src="_partials/nextjs/get-auth" />
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    > [!NOTE]
    > `buildClerkProps` informs client-side features, like `useAuth()`, `<SignedIn>`, and `<SignedOut>`, of the authentication state during server-side rendering.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'pages/example.tsx' }}
    import { getAuth, buildClerkProps } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
    import { GetServerSideProps } from 'next'

    export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (ctx) => {
      // Use `getAuth()` to get the user's ID
      const { userId } = getAuth(ctx.req)

      // Protect the route by checking if the user is signed in
      if (!userId) {
        // Handle when the user is not signed in
      }

      // Initialize the Backend SDK
      const client = await clerkClient()

      // Get the user's full `Backend User` object
      const user = userId ? await client.users.getUser(userId) : undefined

      return { props: { ...buildClerkProps(ctx.req, { user }) } }
    }
    ```
