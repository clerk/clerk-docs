<Steps>
  ## Install `@clerk/tanstack-react-start`

  The [Clerk TanStack React Start SDK](/docs/reference/tanstack-react-start/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, React hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  ```npm {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
  npm install @clerk/tanstack-react-start
  ```

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable and Secret Keys.
    1. Paste your keys into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ## Add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app

  [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/reference/tanstack-react-start/clerk-middleware) grants you access to user authentication state throughout your app, on any server function or route.

  Create a `src/start.ts` file with the following code:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/start.ts' }}
  import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'
  import { createStart } from '@tanstack/react-start'

  export const startInstance = createStart(() => {
    return {
      requestMiddleware: [clerkMiddleware()],
    }
  })
  ```

  ## Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your app

  <Include src="_partials/clerk-provider/explanation" />

  Add the `<ClerkProvider>` component to your app's root route, as shown in the following example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/routes/__root.tsx', ins: [1, 37, 59], fold: [[2, 34]] }}
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'
  import { HeadContent, Scripts, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
  import { TanStackRouterDevtoolsPanel } from '@tanstack/react-router-devtools'
  import { TanStackDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-devtools'

  import Header from '../components/Header'

  import appCss from '../styles.css?url'

  export const Route = createRootRoute({
    head: () => ({
      meta: [
        {
          charSet: 'utf-8',
        },
        {
          name: 'viewport',
          content: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1',
        },
        {
          title: 'TanStack Start Starter',
        },
      ],
      links: [
        {
          rel: 'stylesheet',
          href: appCss,
        },
      ],
    }),

    shellComponent: RootDocument,
  })

  function RootDocument({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    return (
      <ClerkProvider>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <HeadContent />
          </head>
          <body>
            <Header />
            {children}
            <TanStackDevtools
              config={{
                position: 'bottom-right',
              }}
              plugins={[
                {
                  name: 'Tanstack Router',
                  render: <TanStackRouterDevtoolsPanel />,
                },
              ]}
            />
            <Scripts />
          </body>
        </html>
      </ClerkProvider>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Protect your pages

  ### Client-side

  To protect your pages on the client-side, you can use Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/reference/components/overview#control-components) that control the visibility of content based on the user's authentication state.

  The following example uses the following components:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/reference/components/user/user-button): Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/reference/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page. In this example, since no props or [environment variables](/docs/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables) are set for the sign-in URL, this component links to the [Account Portal sign-in page](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/account-portal#sign-in).

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/routes/index.tsx' }}
  import { SignedIn, UserButton, SignedOut, SignInButton } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'
  import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
    component: Home,
  })

  function Home() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Index Route</h1>
        <SignedIn>
          <p>You are signed in</p>
          <UserButton />
        </SignedIn>
        <SignedOut>
          <p>You are signed out</p>
          <SignInButton />
        </SignedOut>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  ### Server-side

  To protect your routes, create a [server function](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/server-functions) that checks the user's authentication state via the [`auth()`](/docs/reference/tanstack-react-start/auth) method. If the user is not authenticated, they are redirected to a sign-in page. If authenticated, the user's `userId` is passed to the route, allowing access to the `<Home />` component, which welcomes the user and displays their `userId`. The [`beforeLoad()`](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/api/router/RouteOptionsType#beforeload-method) method ensures authentication is checked before loading the page, and the [`loader()`](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/api/router/RouteOptionsType#loader-method) method returns the user data for use in the component.

  > [!TIP]
  > Ensure that your app has the [TanStack Start server handler](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/server-routes#handling-server-route-requests) configured in order for your server routes to work.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/routes/index.tsx' }}
  import { createFileRoute, redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'
  import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'
  import { auth } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start/server'

  const authStateFn = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
    const { isAuthenticated, userId } = await auth()

    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      // This will error because you're redirecting to a path that doesn't exist yet
      // You can create a sign-in route to handle this
      // See https://clerk.com/docs/tanstack-react-start/guides/development/custom-sign-in-or-up-page
      throw redirect({
        to: '/sign-in',
      })
    }

    return { userId }
  })

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
    component: Home,
    beforeLoad: async () => await authStateFn(),
    loader: async ({ context }) => {
      return { userId: context.userId }
    },
  })

  function Home() {
    const state = Route.useLoaderData()

    return <h1>Welcome! Your ID is {state.userId}!</h1>
  }
  ```

  ## Create your first user

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit your app's homepage at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Sign up to create your first user.
