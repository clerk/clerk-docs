  - Use Xero to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with Xero allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Xero account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Xero**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Xero Developer](https://developer.xero.com) page.

<Steps>
  ### Enable Xero as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Xero**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Create a Xero app

  1. In the top-right of the [Xero Developer](https://developer.xero.com/app/manage/) home page, select **New app**. The **Add a new app** modal will open.
  1. Fill out the necessary information. In the **Redirect URI** field, paste the **Redirect URI** value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Create app**. You'll be redirected to the app's **App details** page.
  1. In the left sidenav, select **Configuration**.
  1. Select **Generate a secret**. Save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** somewhere secure.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ### Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/test-your-connection" />
