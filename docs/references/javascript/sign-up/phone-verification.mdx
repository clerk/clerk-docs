# Phone verification

These are all methods on the [`SignUp`][signup-ref] class that allow you to verify a user's sign-up request via a phone number.

## `preparePhoneNumberVerification()`

Helper method that allows you to initiate a verification process for a phone number. It basically sends a one-time code to the phone number already supplied to the current sign up.

This is equivalent to calling [`SignUp.prepareVerification("phone_code")`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/verification#prepare-verification).

```typescript
function preparePhoneNumberVerification(params?: PreparePhoneNumberVerificationParams): Promise<SignUpResource>;
```

### `PreparePhoneNumberVerificationParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `strategy` | `'phone_code'` | The verification strategy to validate the user's sign-up request.<br/>The following strategies are supported:<br/><ul><li>`phone_code`: Send an SMS with a unique token to input.</li></ul> |

## `attemptPhoneNumberVerification()`

```typescript
function attemptPhoneNumberVerification(params: AttemptPhoneNumberVerificationParams): Promise<SignUpResource>;
```

Helper method that attempts to complete the verification process for a phone number. It basically verifies that the supplied code is the same as the one-time code that was sent to the phone number during the prepare verification phase.

This is equivalent to calling [`SignUp.attemptVerification({strategy: "phone_code", ...params})`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/verification#attempt-verification).

### `AttemptPhoneNumberVerificationParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | `string` | The code that was sent to the user via SMS. |
