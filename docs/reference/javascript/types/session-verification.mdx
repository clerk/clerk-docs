description: The SessionVerification interface represents the state of a session reverification process.
sdk: js-frontend

An interface that represents the state of the session verification process.

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `status`
  - `'needs_first_factor' | 'needs_second_factor' | 'complete'`

  The current state of the session verification.

  ---

  - `level`
  - `'first_factor' | 'second_factor' | 'multi_factor'`

  The requested level of the session verification.

  ---

  - `session`
  - [`Session`](/docs/reference/javascript/session)

  The `Session` object that the session verification is attached to.

  ---

  - `firstFactorVerification`
  - [`Verification`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/verification)

  The state of the verification process for the selected first factor. Initially, this property contains an empty `Verification` object, since there is no first factor selected. You need to call the [`prepareFirstFactorVerification()`](/docs/reference/javascript/session#prepare-first-factor-verification) method in order to start the verification process.

  ---

  - `secondFactorVerification`
  - [`Verification`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/verification)

  The state of the verification process for the selected second factor. Initially, this property contains an empty `Verification` object, since there is no second factor selected. For the `phone_code` strategy, you need to call the [`prepareSecondFactorVerification()`](/docs/reference/javascript/session#prepare-second-factor-verification) method in order to start the verification process. For the `totp` or `backup_code` strategies, you can directly attempt the verification by calling the [`attemptSecondFactorVerification()`](/docs/reference/javascript/session#attempt-second-factor-verification) method.

  - `supportedFirstFactors`
  - <code>[EmailCodeFactor](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sign-in-first-factor#email-code-factor)\[] | [PhoneCodeFactor](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sign-in-first-factor#phone-code-factor)\[] | [PasswordFactor](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sign-in-first-factor#password-factor)\[]</code>

  Array of the first factors that are supported in the current session verification. Each factor contains information about the verification strategy that can be used.

  ---

  - `supportedSecondFactors`
  - <code>[TOTPFactor](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sign-in-second-factor#totp-factor)\[] | [PhoneCodeFactor](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sign-in-first-factor#phone-code-factor)\[] | [BackupCodeFactor](/docs/reference/javascript/types/sign-in-second-factor#backup-code-factor)\[]</code>

  Array of the second factors that are supported in the current session verification. Each factor contains information about the verification strategy that can be used.
