title: Build your own sign-in and sign-up pages for your TanStack Start app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add custom sign-in and sign-up pages to your TanStack Start app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) and [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) components with the [TanStack Start optional route](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/route#optional-segments) in order to build custom sign-in and sign-up pages for your TanStack Start app.

If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, check out the [custom flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview) guides.

The functionality of the components are controlled by the instance settings you specify in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).

<Steps>
  ## Build your sign-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-up.$.tsx' }}
  import { SignUp } from '@clerk/tanstack-start'

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/sign-up/$')({
    component: Page,
  })

  function Page() {
    return <SignUp />
  }
  ```

  ## Build a sign-in page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-in.$.tsx' }}
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/tanstack-start'

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/sign-in/$')({
    component: Page,
  })

  function Page() {
    return <SignIn />
  }
  ```

  ## Configure your sign-up and sign-in pages

  For SSR Mode, add environment variables for the `signIn`, `signUp`, `afterSignUp`, and `afterSignIn` paths:

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_URL=/
  CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_URL=/
  ```

  These values control the behavior of the components when you sign in or sign up and when you click on the respective links at the bottom of each component.

  ## Visit your new pages

  Run your project with the following terminal command from the root directory of your project:

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom pages locally at [localhost:3000/sign-in](http://localhost:3000/sign-in) and [localhost:3000/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/sign-up).
