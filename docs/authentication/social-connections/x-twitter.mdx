## Overview

Clerk does not currently support preconfigured shared OAuth credentials for X/Twitter on development instances. This means you will have to provide custom credentials for both development _and_ production instances, which includes generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your X/Twitter Developer account. Don't worry, this tutorial will walk you through that process in just a few simple steps.

> [!WARNING]
> X/Twitter v2 is currently not providing email addresses of users. The user will have to fill in their email address manually when they return to your application after authenticating with X/Twitter.

<Steps>
  ### Create an X/Twitter application

  If you don't have an existing X/Twitter application you've set up for social connection, you need to register a new one at the [X/Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). Note that the process requires approval from X/Twitter before your new application can be used.

  To create a new X/Twitter application, navigate to the X/Twitter Developer Portal and go to [**Projects & Apps**](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps). Select **+ Add App**. After entering a name, you will be presented with your app's credentials. However, for setting up the X/Twitter v2 social connection with Clerk, **you won't need these credentials**. This is because you will be utilizing the OAuth 2.0 flow, which relies on different authentication details.

  ### Enable X/Twitter as a social connection

  To enable X/Twitter as a social connection for your Clerk application, go to the Clerk Dashboard. Navigate to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)**. From the list of OAuth vendors, toggle on the X/Twitter option.

  In the modal that opened, copy the **Authorized redirect URI**. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Set the Authorized Redirect URI in your X/Twitter application

  Navigate back to the X/Twitter Developer portal. On the application settings screen, scroll down to the **User authentication settings** section and select **Set up**.

  In the next screen, you'll be presented with the **User authentication settings** page. Under **App permissions**, you can choose the permissions you want to request from the user. For this tutorial, we'll be using the **Read** permission. Under **Type of App**, select **Web App, Automated App or Bot**.

  Under **App info**, in the **Callback URI / Redirect URL** input, paste the **Authorized Redirect URI** value you copied from the Clerk Dashboard in the last step. Your app's settings should like similar to the ones below. Fill any other required fields, such as the **Website URL**, and select **Save**.

  />

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  After setting up your X/Twitter application, you should be able to copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

  Go back to the Clerk Dashboard, where the modal should still be open, and paste these values into the respective fields.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, go to the Clerk Dashboard and navigate to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)**. Click on the settings cog icon next to the X/Twitter option. You can now paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.
