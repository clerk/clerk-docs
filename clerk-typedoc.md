# clerk-typedoc

This folder contains the auto-generated Typedoc documentation of [clerk/javascript](https://github.com/clerk/javascript).

> [!IMPORTANT] > **Do not manually edit `.mdx` files inside this folder.** The contents will only be updated through CI automation and the source of truth for the documents is `clerk/javascript`. Any manual changes will be overridden.

If you want to make a change to a document, follow the instructions to [setup your local environment](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#developing-locally) and how to author [Typedoc changes](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#authoring-typedoc-information).

Once you [opened a PR](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#opening-a-pull-request), it will be merged and released. Afterwards a GitHub action will open to update the contents of this folder.

You can reference files of this folder inside [clerk-docs](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-docs) by using the `<Typedoc src="relative-path/to/file" />` component (e.g. `<Typedoc src="clerk-react/use-auth" />`).
