title: Build your own sign-in-or-up page for your Next.js app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add a custom sign-in-or-up page to your Next.js app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component with the [Next.js optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments) in order to build a custom page for your Next.js app that allows users to sign-in or sign-up within a single flow.

If the prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-in-or-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component to allow users to both sign-in or sign-up from a single flow.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx' }}
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/nextjs'

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignIn />
  }
  ```

  ## Make the sign-in-or-up route public

  By default, `clerkMiddleware()` makes all routes public. **This step is specifically for applications that have configured `clerkMiddleware()` to make [all routes protected](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#protect-all-routes).** If you have not configured `clerkMiddleware()` to protect all routes, you can skip this step.

  To make the sign-in route public:

  - Navigate to your `middleware.ts` file.
  - Create a new [route matcher](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#create-route-matcher) that matches the sign-in route, or you can add it to your existing route matcher that is making routes public.
  - Create a check to see if the user's current route is a public route. If it is not a public route, use [`auth.protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) to protect the route.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
  import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/sign-in(.*)'])

  export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, request) => {
    if (!isPublicRoute(request)) {
      await auth.protect()
    }
  })

  export const config = {
    matcher: [
      // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
      '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
      // Always run for API routes
      '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
    ],
  }
  ```

  ## Update your environment variables

  Update your environment variables to point to your custom sign-in page. Learn more about the available [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables).

  ```env {{ filename: '.env.local' }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  ```

  ## Visit your new page

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-in](http://localhost:3000/sign-in).
