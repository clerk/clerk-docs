Retrieves a list of memberships for an organization. Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) object with a `data` property that contains an array of [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-organization-membership) objects, and a `totalCount` property that indicates the total number of organization memberships in the system for the specified organization.

```ts
function getOrganizationMembershipList(
  params: GetOrganizationMembershipListParams,
): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<OrganizationMembership[]>>
```

## `GetOrganizationMembershipListParams`

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/organizations/{organization_id}/memberships`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organization-Memberships#operation/ListOrganizationMemberships){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
