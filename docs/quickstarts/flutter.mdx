<Steps>
  ## Create an Flutter project

  To get started using Clerk with Flutter, create a new empty Flutter project using the `flutter` CLI or your favorite IDE Flutter extension.

  ## Install the Clerk Flutter SDK

  The Clerk Flutter SDK is distributed via pub.dev. To add the Clerk Flutter SDK to your project run `flutter pub add clerk_flutter` or manuall add `clerk_flutter` to your pubspec.yaml and run `flutter pub get`

  ## Configure Clerk

  - Import Clerk
  - Wrap your app in the ClerkAuth widget and supply your publishable key to the ClerkAuthConfig widget.
  - Use the ClerkErrorListener widget to catch Clerk errors
  - Use the ClerkAuthBuilder widget to conditionally render content
  - Use the ClerkAuthentication prebuilt UI widget to have users sign in and up
  - Use the ClerkUserButton prebuilt UI widget to allow logged in users to manage their account

  ```dart {{ filename: 'lib/main.dart' }}
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
  import 'package:clerk_flutter/clerk_flutter.dart';

  void main() {
    runApp(const MainApp());
  }

  class MainApp extends StatelessWidget {
    const MainApp({super.key});

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return ClerkAuth(
        config: ClerkAuthConfig(publishableKey: 'pk_test...'),
        child: MaterialApp(
          theme: ThemeData.light(),
          debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
          home: Scaffold(
            body: SafeArea(
              child: ClerkErrorListener(
                child: ClerkAuthBuilder(
                  signedInBuilder: (context, authState) {
                    return const ClerkUserButton();
                  },
                  signedOutBuilder: (context, authState) {
                    return const ClerkAuthentication();
                  },
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

  ## Create your first user

  Run your project using `flutter run` or your favorite IDE. Click "Sign up" and authenticate to create your first user.
