# `SignUp`

The `SignUp` object holds the state of the current sign up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the [sign up flow](/docs/authentication/custom-flows). Once a sign up is complete, a new user is created.

There are two important steps that need to be done in order for a sign up to be completed:

- Supply all the required fields. The required fields depend on your instance settings.
- Verify contact information. Some of the supplied fields need extra verification. These are the email address and phone number.

The above steps can be split into smaller actions (e.g. you don't have to supply all the required fields at once) and can done in any order. This provides great flexibility and supports even the most complicated sign up flows.

Also, the attributes of the `SignUp` object can basically be grouped into three categories:

- Those that contain information regarding the sign-up flow and what is missing in order for the sign-up to complete. For more information on these, check our [detailed sign-up flow guide.](/docs/custom-flows)
- Those that hold the different values that we supply to the sign-up. Examples of these are **`username`**, **`emailAddress`**, **`firstName`**, etc.
- Those that contain references to the created resources once the sign-up is complete, i.e. **`createdSessionId`** and **`createdUserId`**.

## Methods

### `create()`

```typescript
function create(params: SignUpCreateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>;
```

This method initiates a new sign-up flow. It creates a new SignUp object and de-activates any existing SignUp that the client might already had in progress.

The form of the given `params` depends on the configuration of the instance. Choices on the instance settings affect which options are available to use.

The `create` method will return a promise of the new SignUp object. This sign up might be complete if you supply the required fields in one go. However, this is not mandatory. Our sign-up process provides great flexibility and allows users to easily create multi-step sign-up flows.

### `update()`

```typescript
function update(params: SignUpUpdateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>;
```

This method is used to update the current sign up.

As with `create`, the form of the given `params` depends on the configuration of the instance.

#### `SignUpUpdateParams`

`SignUpUpdateParams` is a mirror of [`SignUpCreateParams`](#signupcreateparams) with the same fields and types.

### `createMagicLinkFlow()`

```typescript
function createMagicLinkFlow(): {
  startMagicLinkFlow: (params: StartMagicLinkFlowParams) => Promise<SignUp>;
  cancelMagicLinkFlow: () => void;
};
```

Sets up a sign up with magic link flow. Calling `createMagicLinkFlow()` will return two functions.

The first function is async and starts the magic link flow, preparing a magic link verification. It sends the magic link email and starts polling for verification results. The signature is `startMagicLinkFlow({ redirectUrl: string }) => Promise<SignUpResource>`.

The second function can be used to stop polling at any time, allowing for full control of the flow and cleanup. The signature is `cancelMagicLinkFlow() => void`.

#### Returns

`createMagicLinkFlow` returns an object with two functions:

<Tables
  headings={["Name", "Type", "Description"]}
  headingsMeta={[{maxWidth:'300px'},{maxWidth: '300px'},{maxWidth: '300px'}]}

It prepares a magic link verification and polls for the verification result.</>]},
    {cells: [<code>cancelMagicLinkFlow</code>, <code>{"() => void"}</code>, <>Function to cleanup the magic link flow. Stops waiting for verification results.</>]},
  ]}
/>

  ]}
