The `<ClerkDegraded>` component indicates that Clerk is partially operational.

## Example

It's not recommended to wrap the entire app in control components; instead, only wrap the components that need access to the `Clerk` object, such as custom flows.

<Include src="_partials/control-components-with-clerkdegraded" />
