# Customization

The Account Portal also offers a limited set of capabilities to align the visual appearance of the pages with your application's branding and design. This includes the ability to customize the colors, font and button weights.

If you’d rather a precise level of customization through code to match your styling - it is recommended that you use Clerk's embedded components leveraging the [appearance prop](https://clerk.com/docs/component-reference/customization) instead.
