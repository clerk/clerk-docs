Enabling [EASIE SSO](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/enterprise-connections/overview#easie) with Microsoft (formerly [Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/new-name)) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Microsoft account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For specific domains or organizations**.
1. Under **EASIE**, select **Microsoft**.
1. Enter the **Domain**. This is the email domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your application. Optionally, select an **Organization**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials. If you already [configured Microsoft as a social provider](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/microsoft), you can skip this step. EASIE SSO will automatically use the credentials you configured for your social connection.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
