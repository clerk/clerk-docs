  - Configure custom Auth provider for your Clerk application.
</TutorialHero>

Clerk allows you to configure custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) compatible authentication providers for your application. This guide walks you through the steps to set up a custom OAuth provider.

## Configuration

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)
1. In the navigation sidebar, select **User & Authentication > Social Connections**.
1. Under **Custom Auth Providers**, select **Add provider**.
1. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Name**: The provider name (visible to users)
   - **Key**: A unique identifier for the provider (cannot be changed after creation)
   - **Discovery Endpoint**: The OIDC discovery endpoint URL of your provider
     - Alternatively, select **Manual configuration** to set up provider endpoints manually
   - **Client ID**: Obtained from your provider
   - **Client Secret**: Obtained from your provider
1. Select **Save** to add the provider to your instance.

The provider is now configured but not yet enabled. Access the details page for advanced configuration options and to find the **Authorized redirect URLs** to configure in your provider's settings.

Enable the provider either from the provider list or the top of the details page when ready.

## Attribute mapping

If your provider returns claims in a non-standard format:

1. Go to the provider's details page.
1. Under **Attribute mapping**, configure the mapping to match your provider's claim format.

### Tips

- For fields like **Email address verified**, set default values for missing claims.
- If the provider returns a claim but you don't want to set it, leave the mapping field empty.
- If you set a user info URL, it takes priority over the ID Token for claim retrieval.

## Handling edge cases

For providers requiring complex integration:

1. Consider implementing a proxy between Clerk and the provider.
1. Use the proxy to handle transformations or complex API calls.
1. Set the user info endpoint URL to your proxy.
1. Respond to Clerk with properly formatted claims after processing provider data.
