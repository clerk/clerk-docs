# Redesigned Components in Core 2

The new version ships with improved design and UX across all of Clerk's [UI components](/docs/components/overview). If you have used the [`appearance` prop](/docs/components/customization/overview) or tokens for a [custom theme](/docs/components/customization/overview#create-a-custom-theme), you will likely need to make some adjustments to ensure your styling is still looking great. If you're using the [localization prop](/docs/components/customization/localization) you will likely need to make adjustments to account for added or removed localization keys.

<Callout type='info'>
  If you are not customizing the appearance of your components, or using `localization`, you can skip this section. If you are, we recommend using our CLI (`npx @clerk/upgrade`) to scan for changes required as part of the component redesign more quickly.
</Callout>

The sections below contain more info on each change made to the customization ids and localization keys for reference. Regardless of how thoroughly you have reviewed the following information, we still recommend that you ensure that you have taken some time to manually look through each of your views to ensure that everything looks good still.

## Appearance Changes

<Accordion titles={["Within <code>&lt;UserProfile /&gt;</code>, Multi-Factor Auth is Added via Dropdown", "Breaking Changes to appearance variables", "<code>Settings</code> -&gt; <code>General</code> tab in <code>OrganizationProfile</code>", "Within <code>&lt;UserProfile /&gt;</code>, Account and Security Pages Separated", "Within <code>&lt;UserProfile /&gt;</code>, Connected Accounts Added via Dropdown", "<code>userButtonPopoverActionButtonText</code> customization id removed", "<code>userButtonBox</code> is now a child of <code>userButtonTrigger</code>", "<code>organizationSwitcherPopoverActionButtonText</code> customization id removed", "Changes to the <code>card</code> customization id", "Back button customization ids change on alternative 2fa methods page", "<code>button</code> -&gt; <code>organizationListCreateOrganizationActionButton</code> customization id", "<code>socialButtonsBlockButtonArrow</code> customization id removed", "Identity preview avatar customization ids removed", "Changes to default variables"]}>
  <AccordionPanel>
    Within the `<UserProfile />` component (which is also rendered by `<UserButton />`), adding a multi-factor auth (MFA) method is now rendered as a dropdown instead of a modal. If you were relying on the modal for any sort of customizations, these customizations will need to be adjusted to the new form factor.

    Two new appearance prop keys were added to aid with this process: `cl-menuList__mfa` for styling the list of MFA factors, and `cl-menuItem__mfa` for styling individual items.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    Several appearance variables have been removed or renamed. If you were using these variables in your application, you will need to update your code to use the new variables.
    - The `fontSmoothing` variable has been removed.
    - The `shadowShimmer` variable has been removed.
    - The `colorAlphaShade` variable has been renamed to `colorNeutral`.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The "Settings" tab within the `<OrganizationProfile />` component has been renamed to "General". If you are linking directly to `/organization-settings` from anywhere, the link will need to be updated to `/organization-general`.

    If you are [customizing the component](/docs/components/customization/organization-profile) by re-ordering the pages, the label used to target this page must be changed from `settings` to `general` as well.

    If you are using the [appearance prop](/docs/components/customization/overview) to customize the appearance of the `<OrganizationProfile />` component, please note that the `cl-profilePage__organizationSettings` key has also been changed to `cl-profilePage__organizationGeneral` to be consistent with the naming change.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    Within the `<UserProfile />` component (which is also rendered by `<UserButton />`), the "Account" and "Security" pages now live within their own tabs. Previously, "Security" was a section within the "Account" tab. The "Security" page can now be directly linked to under the `/security` path if desired.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    Within the `<UserProfile />` component (which is also rendered by `<UserButton />`), adding a connected account is now rendered as a dropdown instead of a modal. If you were relying on the modal for any sort of customizations, these customizations will need to be adjusted to the new form factor.

    New appearance prop keys were added to aid with customization, if desired:

    - `cl-menuList__connectedAccounts` for styling the list of connected account addition options
    - `cl-menuItem__connectedAccounts` for styling individual items in the connected account options list
    - `cl-menuList__web3Wallets` for styling the list of web3 wallet addition options
    - `cl-menuItem__web3Wallets` for styling individual items in the web3 wallets options list
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The `userButtonPopoverActionButtonText` customization id has been removed, as the text for this button is now directly rendered inside the button rather than an extra wrapping element. The nested ids `userButtonPopoverActionButtonText__signOut` and `userButtonPopoverActionButtonText__manageAccount` have also been removed. Any styling that needs to apply to the text can be applied to its direct parent `cl-userButtonPopoverActionButton`.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The parent-child relationship of the two elements `userButtonTrigger` and `userButtonBox` has been swapped. Previously, `userButtonTrigger` was nested inside of `userButtonBox`, and now `userButtonBox` is nested inside of `userButtonTrigger`. This change resolves [some usability issues](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/issues/1625) in `<UserButton />`. If you are applying style customization to either of these elements, your customizations may need to be adjusted.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The `organizationSwitcherPopoverActionButtonText` customization id has been removed, as the text for this button is now directly rendered inside the button rather than an extra wrapping element. The nested ids `organizationSwitcherPopoverActionButtonText__manageOrganization` and `organizationSwitcherPopoverActionButtonText__createOrganization` have also been removed. Any styling that needs to apply to the text can be applied to its direct parent `cl-organizationSwitcherPopoverActionButton`.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The `card` customization id in the previous major version was the main and only container element for components. Outside the `card` element, a new `cardBox` id was introduced that allows more fine-grained style customization.

    As a note, if you are changing the background color of `card`, you will also need to also apply the same color on the `footer` id as well. The `footer` now gray by default, and itâ€™s located outside `card`, but inside `cardBox`.

    A `footerItem` id was also added for more targeted styling of items inside the `footer`.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The "back" button on the panel within `<SignIn />` that lists out alternative two factor auth methods has changed location, and there have been some changes to the ids as a result of this:

    - `headerBackIcon` has been removed, as there is no longer an associated icon
    - `headerBackRow` has been renamed to `backRow` as it's no longer in the header
    - `headerBackLink` has been renamed to `backLink` as it's no longer in the header
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The `button` customization id was used only in one place, for a button to create a new organization in the `<OrganizationList />` component. This id has been removed and replaced by the more appropriately named `organizationListCreateOrganizationActionButton` customization id instead.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    Social sign-in buttons in the new component designs no longer include arrows, so the `socialButtonsBlockButtonArrow` customization id has been removed. You can use the `socialButtonsIconButton` to apply custom styling to the social buttons if desired.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    When signing in with Clerk's `<SignIn />` component, after entering a username or email the user is brought to a second pane where they can enter a second factor such as a password. On this pane, there is an area called "identity preview" that shows the username/email that they are entering a password/etc for. Previously, this area included the user's avatar, but this is no longer the case in updated designs. As such, the customization ids related to the user's avatar have been removed.
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The default values of some [appearance variables](/docs/components/customization/variables) have changed which may impact your UI (if you are not already overriding them).

        - The default `colorPrimary` value changed from `#103FEF` to `#2F3037`. As the new color is a dark grey, the `colorPrimary` of the dark theme was changed to `#FFFFFF`.
        - The default `fontSize` value changed from `1rem` to `0.8125rem`
        - The default `fontWeight` values changed from `{ normal: 400, medium: 500, bold: 600 }` to `{ normal: 400, medium: 500, semibold: 600, bold: 700 }`.
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

## Localization Changes

<Accordion titles={["New localization keys added", "Removed localization keys", "Localization keys changed"]}>
  <AccordionPanel>
    As part of the redesign of Clerk's components, a number of new localization keys have been added and can be seen along with their default english values in the code block below. If you do not supply translated values for these keys in your custom localization, they will fall back to the default english values specified below.

    ```js
    const newValues = {
      formButtonPrimary__verify: 'Verify',
      formFieldInputPlaceholder__confirmDeletionUserAccount: 'Delete account',

          successMessage2:
            'Save these backup codes and store them somewhere safe. If you lose access to your authentication device, you can use backup codes to sign in.',

          },
        },
      },
    };
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
  <AccordionPanel>
    As part of the redesign of Clerk's components, a number of localization keys have been removed as they were no longer present in the new designs. You should remove any of these keys that are present in your localization object as they are no longer needed.

    ```js
    const deletedKeys = [

      'organizationProfile.membersPage.requestsTab.requests.headerSubtitle',

    ```

    If you'd like to automate this, you can use the [lodash omit function](https://lodash.com/docs/#omit) as such:

    ```js
    import { omit } from 'lodash-es';

    const localization = omit(yourOldOject, deletedKeys);
    ```

  <AccordionPanel>
    The values of some keys have been changed on the default [en-US localization object](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/localizations/src/en-US.ts). The list below shows you the new defaults (as of writing this guide) which you can either use or overwrite. If you have overridden these values, make sure to double check so you can be sure that your modifications are appropriate.
