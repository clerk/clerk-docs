# Email verification

These are all methods on the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) class that allow you to verify a user's sign-up request via email.

## `prepareEmailAddressVerification()`

Helper method that allows you to initiate a verification process for an email address. It basically sends a one-time code to the email address already supplied to the current sign-up.

The defaults of this method are equivalent to calling [`SignUp.prepareVerification('email_code')`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/verification#prepareverification).

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function prepareEmailAddressVerification(params?: PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<SignUpResource>;
```

### `PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `strategy` | `'email_code' \| 'email_link'` | The verification strategy to validate the user's sign-up request.<br />The following strategies are supported:<br /><ul><li>`email_code`: Send an email with a unique token to input.</li><li>`email_link`: Send an email with a link which validates sign-up</li></ul> |
| `redirectUrl` | `string` | The URL to redirect the user to after the verification process is complete.<br />Only supported on `email_link`, `oauth_<provider>`, and `saml` strategies. |

## `attemptEmailAddressVerification()`

Helper method that attempts to complete the verification process for an email address. It basically verifies that the supplied code is the same as the one-time code that was sent to the email address during the prepare verification phase.

This is equivalent to calling [`SignUp.attemptVerification({strategy: 'email_code', ...params})`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/verification#attempt-verification).

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
function attemptEmailAddressVerification(params: AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<SignUpResource>;
```

### `AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `code` | `string` | The code that was sent to the user via email. |
