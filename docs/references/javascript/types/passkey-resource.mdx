For an example of how to use these methods, see the [Passkeys custom flows documentation](/docs/custom-flows/passkeys).

### `update()`

Updates the name of the associated passkey for the signed-in user.

```typescript
  function update: (params: { name: string }) => Promise<PasskeyResource>;
```

For an example of how to use these methods, see the [Passkeys custom flows documentation](/docs/custom-flows/passkeys#rename-user-passkeys).

### `delete()`

Deletes the associated passkey for the signed-in user.


```typescript
  function delete: () => Promise<DeletedObject>;
