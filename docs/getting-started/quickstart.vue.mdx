This tutorial assumes that you're using [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

<Steps>
  ### Create a Vue app using Vite

  Run the following commands to create a new Vue app using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project):

  ```npm
  npm create vite@latest clerk-vue -- --template vue-ts
  cd clerk-vue
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  ### Install `@clerk/vue`

  The [Clerk Vue SDK](/docs/reference/vue/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, composables, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  ```npm
  npm install @clerk/vue
  ```

  ### Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add your Clerk Publishable Key to your `.env` file. This key can always be retrieved from the [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable Key.
    1. Paste your key into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  ```

  ### Add `clerkPlugin` to your app

  `clerkPlugin` provides session and user context to Clerk's components and composables. It's required to pass your Clerk Publishable Key as an option. You can add an `if` statement to check that the key is imported properly. This prevents the app from running without the Publishable Key and catches TypeScript errors.

  The `clerkPlugin` accepts optional options, such as `{ signInForceRedirectUrl: '/dashboard' }`. See the [reference documentation](/docs/reference/vue/clerk-plugin) for more information.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'src/main.ts', mark: [4, [12, 14]] }}
  import { createApp } from 'vue'
  import './style.css'
  import App from './App.vue'
  import { clerkPlugin } from '@clerk/vue'

  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
    throw new Error('Add your Clerk Publishable Key to the .env file')
  }

  const app = createApp(App)
  app.use(clerkPlugin, { publishableKey: PUBLISHABLE_KEY })
  app.mount('#app')
  ```

  ### Create a header with Clerk components

  You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/reference/components/overview#control-components). The following example creates a header using the following components:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/reference/components/user/user-button): Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/reference/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page or displays the sign-in modal.

  ```vue {{ filename: 'src/App.vue', mark: [2, [6, 13]] }}
  <script setup lang="ts">
  import { SignedIn, SignedOut, SignInButton, UserButton } from '@clerk/vue'
  </script>

  <template>
    <header>
      <SignedOut>
        <SignInButton />
      </SignedOut>
      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton />
      </SignedIn>
    </header>
  </template>
  ```

  ### Create your first user

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit your app's homepage at [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173). Sign up to create your first user.
