title: '`create()`'
description: Use Clerk's Backend SDK to create an API key.
sdk: js-backend
---

Creates a new [API key](/docs/guides/development/machine-auth/api-keys).

```ts
function create(params: CreateAPIKeyParams): Promise<APIKey>
```

## `CreateAPIKeyParams`

<Properties>
  - `name`
  - `string`

  A descriptive name for the API key (e.g., "Production API Key", "Development Key").

  ---

  - `subject`
  - `string`

  The user ID (`user_xxx`) or organization ID (`org_xxx`) to associate the API key with.

  ---

  - `description?`
  - `string | null`

  A longer description of what the API key is used for.

  ---

  - `scopes?`
  - `string[]`

  An array of scope strings that define what the API key can access.

  ---

  - `claims?`
  - `Record<string, unknown> | null`

  A JavaScript object that can be used to store additional information about the API key.

  ---

  - `createdBy?`
  - `string | null`

  The user ID of the user creating the API key (for audit purposes).

  ---

  - `secondsUntilExpiration?`
  - `number | null`

  The number of seconds until the API key will expire. By default, the API key will not expire. API keys are typically long-lived tokens that don't expire, as expiring API keys would cause third-party services using them to break unexpectedly.
</Properties>

## Example

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

### Basic API key creation

```ts
const apiKey = await clerkClient.apiKeys.create({
  name: 'My API Key',
  subject: 'user_xxx',
})
```

### API key with optional parameters

```ts
const apiKey = await clerkClient.apiKeys.create({
  name: 'Production API Key',
  subject: 'user_xxx',
  description: 'API key for accessing my application',
  scopes: ['read:users', 'write:users'],
  secondsUntilExpiration: 86400, // expires in 24 hours
})
```

> [!WARNING]
> The API key secret is only available in the response from `create()` and cannot be retrieved again. Make sure to store the secret securely immediately after creation.

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `POST/api_keys`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/api-keys/post/api_keys){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
