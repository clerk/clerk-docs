> [!WARNING]
> The React Router SDK is currently in beta.

The Clerk React Router SDK is built on top of the Clerk React SDK and provides access to all of Clerk React's hooks. These hooks give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. Learn more about these hooks in the [React SDK reference](/docs/references/react/overview).

## Client-side helpers

The React Router SDK provides hooks that give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object and helper methods for authentication flows. See the [React SDK reference](/docs/references/react/overview) for details.

## Server-side helpers

The following references show how to integrate Clerk features into applications using React Router server functions and API routes.

- [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/react-router/get-auth)
- [`rootAuthLoader()`](/docs/references/react-router/root-auth-loader)

### `Auth` object

The `getAuth()` method returns an `Auth` object. This JavaScript object contains important information like the current user's session ID, user ID, and organization ID. Learn more about the [`Auth` object](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }}.

## React Router implementations

React Router can be integrated with Clerk in two ways:

- As a framework (recommended): Configure your app using [Clerk's React Router SDK](/docs/quickstarts/react-router)
- As a library: Manually integrate React Router into your React + Vite app using [library mode](/docs/references/react-router/library-mode)
