Organizations can be created by developers in the Clerk Dashboard or by end users in your application. Once created, you can manage individual organization profiles, update settings, and help users switch between multiple organizations.

This guide covers working with individual organizations. For global settings that affect all organizations in your application (like enabling organizations, setting default roles, or configuring membership), refer to [Configure Organizations](/docs/guides/organizations/configure).

## Create an organization

Organizations can be created in the Clerk Dashboard by developers or in your application by end users. The number of organizations you can create depends on your [Monthly Active Organization (MAO) limits](/docs/guides/organizations/overview#how-do-organizations-work).

### Create an organization in the Clerk Dashboard

To create an organization in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Organizations**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations).
1. Select the **Create Organization** button.
1. Enter the organization's name. Optionally, upload the organization's logo, enter the organization's slug, and select the organization's owner. The slug is a unique identifier for the organization that is used in URLs, such as `example-name`.

### Create an organization in your application

By default, users have permission to create organizations within your application. When a user creates an organization, they become the organization's [admin](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions#default-roles) with full control over settings, members, and permissions.

**Default limits**: Each user can create up to 100 organizations. To change creation permissions or limits, see the [Configure Organizations guide](/docs/guides/organizations/configure#user-created-organizations).

The easiest way to allow users to create organizations is to use the [`<CreateOrganization />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/create-organization) and/or [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher) components. The `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component is more comprehensive, as it handles all organization flows including creation, switching, and management.

If the prebuilt components don't meet your needs, you can build [custom flows](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview) using the Clerk API.

## Manage organizations

As an application owner, you can manage all organizations in your application. This includes the organizations you created and those created by your users. You can view, update, and delete organizations, as well as manage their members and settings.

### Manage organizations in the Clerk Dashboard

To manage organizations in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Organizations**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations) to view all organizations in your application.
1. Select a specific organization to view its details, members, invitations, and settings.
1. From here, you can update the organization's name, slug, logo, and public and private metadata. You can also adjust the organization's [membership limit](/docs/guides/organizations/configure#membership-limits).

### Manage organizations in your application

For managing organizations in your application, Clerk provides prebuilt components that handle organization management flows:

- [`<OrganizationProfile />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-profile) - A profile page for the user's currently active organization where they can update settings and manage members.
- [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher) - A dropdown menu that handles all organization flows, including switching between organizations and managing the active organization's profile.
- [`<OrganizationList />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-list) - A list of organizations that a user is a member of, with options to switch between them.

If the prebuilt components don't meet your needs, you can build [custom flows](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview) using the Clerk API.

## Switch between organizations

Users who belong to multiple organizations can switch between them at any time. The currently selected organization is called the active organization.

The [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher) component provides the easiest way for users to switch between organizations. If you need more control over the switching logic, you can use the `setActive()` method from the [`useOrganizationList()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-organization-list) hook, or access it directly from the [`Clerk`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#set-active) object.

If [personal accounts are enabled](/docs/guides/organizations/configure#personal-accounts), users can also switch to their personal account using the `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component.
