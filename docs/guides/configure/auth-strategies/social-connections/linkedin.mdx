## Overview

Adding social connection with LinkedIn to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized Redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your LinkedIn account.

> [!NOTE]
> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a LinkedIn account and a LinkedIn OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/overview).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, see the [setup guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a LinkedIn account. To create one, [click here](https://developer.linkedin.com/).

## Configuring LinkedIn social connection

First, you need to create a new OAuth LinkedIn app.

![Creating an OAuth LinkedIn app](/docs/images/authentication-providers/linkedin/148540a6928a19c42d105d50c91bd4a61c1d3326-1096x978.png)

You need to set a name, associate a LinkedIn page with it, and upload a logo for your new application.

In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **LinkedIn**.

Toggle on **Use custom credentials** and copy **Authorized Redirect URI**. Paste the value into the **Redirect URL** of your LinkedIn app, as shown below.

The last thing you have to do is to enable the _Sign in with LinkedIn_ product for your OAuth application.

![Enable Sign In with LinkedIn product](/docs/images/authentication-providers/linkedin/9b2aae3fa3612dd7ae3b982b2c5a7e1d41409d49-1064x765.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to ensure the longevity of the user's [access token](!access-token) without the need for re-authentication, make sure to obtain approval as a [Marketing Developer Platform (MDP) partner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/quick-start?view=li-lms-2023-10#step-1-apply-for-api-access). This is not required if you don't directly interact with the LinkedIn API using the access token.

Copy the **Application ID** and **Secret** from the previous screen. Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.

Finally, select **Add connection** so that the settings are applied. Congratulations! Social connection with LinkedIn is now configured for your instance.
