Retrieves a list of memberships for an organization. Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) object with a `data` property that contains an array of [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-organization-membership) objects, and a `totalCount` property that indicates the total number of organization memberships in the system for the specified organization.

```ts
function getOrganizationMembershipList(
  params: GetOrganizationMembershipListParams,
): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<OrganizationMembership[]>>
```

## `GetOrganizationMembershipListParams`

<Properties>
  - `organizationId`
  - `string`

  The ID of the organization to retrieve the list of memberships from.

  ---

  - `limit?`
  - `number`

  The number of results to return. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than 501. Can be used for paginating the results together with `offset`. Defaults to `10`.

  ---

  - `offset?`
  - `number`

  Skip the first `offset` results when paginating. Needs to be an integer greater or equal to zero. To be used in conjunction with `limit`. Defaults to `0`.

  ---

  - `orderBy?`
  - `'phone_number' | 'email_address' | 'created_at' | 'first_name' | 'last_name' | 'username'`

  Return memberships in a particular order. Prefix with a `-` to reverse the order. Prefix with a `+` to list in ascending order. Defaults to `'-created_at'`.

  ---

  - `userId?`
  - `string[]`

  Returns memberships with the user ids specified. For each user id, the `+` and `-` can be prepended to the id, which denote whether the respective user id should be included or excluded from the result set. Accepts up to 100 user ids. Any user ids not found are ignored.

  ---

  - `emailAddress?`
  - `string[]`

  Returns users with the specified email addresses. Accepts up to 100 email addresses. Any email addresses not found are ignored.

  - `query?`
  - `string`

  Filters users that match the given query. For possible matches, we check the email addresses, phone numbers, usernames, Web3 wallet addresses, user IDs, first and last names. The query value doesn't need to match the exact value you are looking for, it is capable of partial matches as well.

  ---

  - `emailAddressQuery?`
  - `string`

  Filters users with emails that match the given query, via case-insensitive partial match. For example, `email_address_query=ello` will match a user with the email `HELLO@example.com`.

  Filters users with phone numbers that match the given query, via case-insensitive partial match. For example, `phone_number_query=555` will match a user with the phone number `+1555xxxxxxx`.
  
  ---

  - `usernameQuery?`
  - `string`

  Filters users with usernames that match the given query, via case-insensitive partial match. For example, `username_query=CoolUser` will match a user with the username `SomeCoolUser`.
  
  ---

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/organizations/{organization_id}/memberships`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organization-Memberships#operation/ListOrganizationMemberships){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
