How to set up social connection with Notion

## Overview

Adding social connection with Notion to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your LinkedIn account.

> [!NOTE]
> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Notion developer account and a Notion OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Notion developer account. To create one, [click here](https://developers.notion.com/).

## Configuring Notion social connection

First, you need to create a new OAuth Notion app.

You need to set a name, a logo, and associate a Notion workspace with it. Make sure you are also requesting the user email address along with the other information and click **Submit**.

In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)**. From the list of OAuth vendors, toggle on the Notion option. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Paste the value into the **Redirect URIs**, as shown below, after changing the integration type to **Public**. Fill any other information required from Notion and click Submit.

Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret** as shown in the above image. Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with Notion is now configured for your instance.
