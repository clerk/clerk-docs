## How to use the `useSessionList()` hook

The following example demonstrates how to use the `useSessionList()` hook to retrieve a list of sessions that have been registered on the client device. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state, and the `sessions` property is used to display the number of times the user has visited the page.

```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'home.tsx' }}
import { useSessionList } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export default function Home() {
  const { isLoaded, sessions } = useSessionList();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // handle loading state
    return null;
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Welcome back. You have been here
      {sessions.length} times before.
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```
