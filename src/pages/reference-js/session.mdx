# Session

The `Session` object is an abstraction over an HTTP session. It models the period of information exchange between a user and the server.

The `Session` object includes methods for recording session activity and ending the session client-side. For security reasons, sessions can also expire server-side.

As soon as a [User](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/clerkjs/user) signs in, we create a Session for the current [Client](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/clerkjs/client). Clients can have more than one sessions at any point in time, but only one of those sessions will be **active**.

In certain scenarios, a session might be replaced by another one. This is often the case with [mutli-session applications](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/multi-session-applications).

All sessions that are **expired**, **removed**, **replaced**, **ended** or **abandoned** are not considered valid.

> For more details regarding the different session states, see our documentation on [Session management](https://clerk.com/docs/request-authentication/validate-session-tokens).

## Methods

### `end()`

```typescript
function end(): Promise<Session>;
```

Marks the session as ended. The session will no longer be active for this Client and its status will become **ended**.

#### Returns

<Tables
  headings={["Type", "Description"]}
  rows={[
  {cells: [ <code>Promise{"<"}<a href="/reference-js/session">Session</a>{">"}</code>, <>The session that was just ended.</>]},
  ]}
/>

### `remove()`

```typescript
function remove(): Promise<Session>;
```

Marks the session as removed. The session will no longer be active for this Client and its status will become **removed**.

#### Returns

<Tables
  headings={["Type", "Description"]}
  rows={[
  {cells: [ <code>Promise{"<"}<a href="/reference-js/session">Session</a>{">"}</code>, <>The session that was just removed.</>]},
  ]}
/>

### `touch()`

```typescript
function touch(): Promise<Session>;
```

Touches the session, signifying some kind of user activity. Use this method to record any updates to user activity.


#### Returns

<Tables
  headings={["Type", "Description"]}
  rows={[
  {cells: [ <code>Promise{"<"}<a href="/reference-js/session">Session</a>{">"}</code>, <>The session that was just touched.</>]},
  ]}
/>


### `getToken()`

```typescript
function getToken(options?: GetTokenOptions): Promise<string | null>;
```

Retrieves the user's session token for the given template or the default clerk token. This method uses a cache so a network request will only be made if the token in memory has expired. The TTL for clerk token is one minute.

#### GetTokenOptions

<Tables
  headings={["Name", "Type", "Description"]}
  headingsMeta={[{}, {}, {maxWidth: "300px"}]}
  rows={[
{cells: [<code>leewayInSeconds</code>, <code>number</code>, <>The number of seconds that we allow the token to be cached.</>]},
{cells: [<code>template?</code>, <code>string</code>, <>The name of the JWT template to generate a new token from.</>]},
{cells: [<code>throwOnError?</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <>Whether to throw an error or return an empty string, if an error occurs.</>]},
{cells: [<code>skipCache?</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <>Whether to skip the cache lookup and force a call to the server instead, even within the TTL. Useful if the token claims are time-sensitive or depend on data that can be updated (e.g. user fields). (default: false)</>]},
  ]}
/>


#### Returns

<Tables
  headings={["Type", "Description"]}
  rows={[
  {cells: [ <code>Promise{"<string | null>"}</code>, <>The requested token.</>]},
  ]}
/>
