# `authenticateRequest()`

Authenticates a token passed from the frontend. Networkless if the `secretKey` or `jwtKey` are provided. Otherwise, performs a network call to retrieve the JWKS from Clerk's Backend API.

```tsx
function authenticateRequest: (request: Request, options: AuthenticateRequestOptions) => Promise<RequestState>;
```

## `authenticateRequest()` example

Takes the token passed by the frontend as a Bearer token in the Authorization header, and performs a networkless authenication. This will verify if the user is signed into the application or not.

```tsx
import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const { isSignedIn } = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(req)

  if ( !isSignedIn ) {
    return NextResponse.json({ status: 401 })
  }

  // Perform protected actions

  return NextResponse.json({ message: "This is a reply" })
}
```
