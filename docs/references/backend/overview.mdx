# Clerk Backend SDK

The [Clerk Backend SDK](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/tree/main/packages/backend) exposes Clerk's backend API resources and low-level authentication utilities for JavaScript environments. While the backend SDK is mainly used as a building block for Clerk's higher-level SDKs, it can also be used on its own for advanced flows and custom integrations.

<Callout type="info">
Clerk's Next.js and Node SDKs expose an instance of the Clerk Backend SDK for use in server environments. The Backend SDK is accessible via the `clerkClient` object if you are using Next.js, and the `clerk` object if you are using Node.
