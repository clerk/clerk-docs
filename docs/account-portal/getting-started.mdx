# Getting started with the Account Portal  

To integrate the Account Portal into your application, simply follow one of our [quickstart guides](/docs/quickstarts/overview). 

Once your application is set up, all you have to do is fire it up. Clerk will automatically redirect your users to the Account Portal sign-in/sign-up pages. Once a user has successfully authenticated themself, they will be automatically redirected back to your application with an active session.

  **Dynamic Development Host Detection**  

  For development environments, the development host (e.g. http://localhost:3000) is dynamically detected by Clerk at runtime and tied to your client browser. We store this as the â€˜home originâ€™ for your application and it is equivalent to your application domain in production environments.

## Accessing your pages

For development environments, Clerk will issue you a randomly generated domain on "accounts.dev". In production, by default, the URLs for your Account Portal are the following:

```sh
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/sign-in
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/sign-up
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/user
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/organization
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/create-organization
```

You can access these links under **Account Portal -> Pages** in your Clerk dashboard.

## Direct links

If a user accesses an Account Portal page directly, the `redirect_url` query param will not be present, so the user cannot be redirected back to your application once they are finished with their Account Portal flow. To prevent this, it is recommend that you always specify the redirect in the link when sharing it. 

You can use the following format for your direct links:

`https://accounts.<your-domain.com>/<account-portal-page>?redirect_url=https://<your-domain.com>/dashboard`

### Example

In this example, the domain is `myapp.com`, the user is being linked to the sign-in Account Portal page, and the user will be redirected to `https://myapp.com/dashboard` after they are signed in.

`https://accounts.myapp.com/sign-in?redirect_url=https://myapp.com/dashboard`


## Fallback redirects

In the case that a user does visit an Account Portal page directly without the query param, don't worry - Clerk offers a fallback configuration via the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).

<Steps>

### Set your static fallback host

Set your fallback host under **Paths** in the Clerk Dashboard. 

For development, set your static fallback localhost with the port that you use (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`). Clerk will use this fallback host if a dev browser fails to be retrieved for your client. In production, we will always default to your application homepage.
