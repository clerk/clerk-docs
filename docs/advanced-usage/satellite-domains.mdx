# Adding satellite domains

Clerk supports sharing sessions across different domains by adding one or many satellite domains to an application.

Your "primary" domain is where the authentication state lives, and satellite domains are able to securely read that state from the primary domain, enabling a seamless authentication flow across domains.

Users must complete the sign-in flow on the primary domain, either using Clerkâ€™s [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component or [`useSignIn()`](/docs/custom-flows/use-sign-up#use-sign-in) hook.

To access authentication state from a satellite domain, users will be transparently redirected to the primary domain. If users need to sign in, they must be redirected to a sign in flow hosted on the primary domain, then redirected back to the originating satellite domain.

## How to add satellite domains

<Steps>

### Create your application and install Clerk

<Callout type="warning">
Currently, multi-domain can be added to any Next.js or Remix application. For other React frameworks, multi-domain is still supported as long as you do not use server rendering or hydration.
</Callout>

To get started, you need to create an application from the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). Once you create an instance via the Clerk Dashboard, you will be prompted to choose a domain. This is your primary domain. For the purposes of this guide, the primary domain will be `primary.dev`.

When building your sign-in flow, you must configure it to run within your primary application, e.g. on `/sign-in`.

<Callout type="info">
  For more information about creating your application, check out Clerk's [detailed guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
</Callout>

### Add your first satellite domain

In the Clerk Dashboard, go to the **[Domains](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=domains)** page and then open the **Satellite** tab. Click on the **Add satellite domain** button to add a new satellite domain of your choice. Then, follow the instructions provided.

For the purposes of this guide, the satellite domain will be "satellite.dev".

### Configure your satellite app

There are two ways that you can configure your Clerk satellite application to work with the primary domain:

- Using environment variables
- Using properties

#### Configure your satellite app with environment variables

You can configure your satellite application by setting the following environment variables:

<CodeBlockTabs type="framework" options={["Next.js", "Remix"]}>
```env filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_DOMAIN=satellite.dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_IS_SATELLITE=true

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=https://primary.dev/sign-in
```
```env filename=".env"
CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}

CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=https://primary.dev/sign-in
CLERK_DOMAIN=satellite.dev
CLERK_IS_SATELLITE=true
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

#### Configure your satellite app with properties

You can configure your satellite application as a satellite application by setting the `isSatellite`, `domain`, and `signInUrl` properties.

The properties related to the multi-domain setup are:

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `isSatellite` | `boolean` or `(url: URL) => boolean` | This option defines that the application is a satellite application. |
| `domain` | `string` or `(url: URL) => boolean` | This option sets the domain of the satellite application. This is required since we cannot figure this out by your publishable key, since it is the same for all of your multi-domain apps. |
| `signInUrl` | `string` | This url will be used for any redirects that might happen and needs to point to your primary application. This option is optional for production instances and required for development instances. |

The `URL` parameter that can be passed to `isSatellite` and `domain` is the request url for server side usage or the current location for client usage.

<Tabs type="framework" items={["Next.js", "Remix"]}>
  <Tab>
    In a Next.js application, you must set the properties in the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component *and* in your [`authMiddleware()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware).

    Configuring your `<ClerkProvider>` component should look like this:

    ```jsx filename="_app.tsx"
    import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs";
    import Head from "next/head";

    export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider isSatellite domain={(url) => url.host} signInUrl='https://primary.dev/sign-in' {...pageProps}>
          <Head>
            <title>Satellite Next.js app</title>
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
          </Head>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </ClerkProvider>
      );
    }
    ```

    And your middleware should look like this:

    ```js filename="middleware.ts"
    import {
      clerkMiddleware,
      createRouteMatcher
    } from "@clerk/nextjs/server"

    // Set the homepage as a public route
    const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher(["/"])

    // Set the necessary options for a satellite application
    const options = {
      isSatellite: true,
      signInUrl: 'https://primary.dev/sign-in',
      domain: 'https://primary.dev',
    };

    export default clerkMiddleware((auth, req) => {
      if (isPublicRoute(req)) return; // if it's a public route, do nothing
      auth().protect(); // for any other route, require auth
    }, options);

    export const config = {
      matcher: ["/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    In a Remix application, you must set the properties in the [`ClerkApp`](/docs/references/remix/clerk-app) wrapper.

    ```js filename="root.tsx"
    export const loader = (args) => {
      return rootAuthLoader(
        args,
        ({ request }) => {
          const { userId, sessionId, getToken } = request.auth;
          return json({
              message: `Hello from the root loader :)`,
              ENV: getBrowserEnvironment(),
          });
        },
        {
          loadUser: true,
          signInUrl: 'https://primary.dev/sign-in',
          isSatellite: true,
          domain: (url) => url.host
        } as const
      );
    };

    export default ClerkApp(App, {
      isSatellite: true,
      domain: (url) => url.host,
      signInUrl: 'https://primary.dev/sign-in',
    });
    ```
  </Tab>

</Tabs>

### Ready to go ðŸŽ‰

Your satellite application should now be able to access the authentication state from your satellite domain!

You can see it in action by:
1. Visiting the primary domain and signing in.
2. Visiting the satellite domain.
3. You now have an active session in the satellite domain, so you can see the [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/components/user/user-profile) component and update your information.

You can repeat this process and create as many satellite applications as you need.

</Steps>

You can also check out the [example repository](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-nextjs-multi-domain-example) with a primary and a satellite Next.js application.

If you have any questions about satellite domains, or you're having any trouble setting this up, please contact support@clerk.com
