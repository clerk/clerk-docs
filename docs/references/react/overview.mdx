description: Learn how to integrate Clerk into your React application using the Clerk React SDK.
---

The Clerk React SDK is built on top of the Clerk JavaScript SDK, and is the recommended method for integrating Clerk into your React application.

## Key Features

- **Pre-built Components**: Clerk React provides React.js implementations of [Clerk components](/docs/components/overview) for user management, including:
  - [Sign-in](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in)
  - [Sign-up](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up)
  - [Account switching](/docs/components/user/user-button)
  - [User profile management](/docs/components/user/user-profile)
  - [Control components](/docs/components/control/signed-in)
- **Custom Hooks**: Access to [custom hooks](/docs/references/react/use-user) that provide:
  - Direct access to the [`Clerk` object](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk)
  - Helper methods for authentication flows

## Framework-specific SDKs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Clerk provides optimized SDKs for specific React frameworks. If you're using one of the supported frameworks below, you should use its dedicated SDK instead of `@clerk/clerk-react`.
>
> For example, Next.js applications **must** use `@clerk/nextjs` as `@clerk/clerk-react` is not compatible.

Clerk offers framework-specific SDKs that are customized to provide the better developer experience and integration with each framework's features. Choose the appropriate SDK based on your framework:

| Framework | Package | Docs |
| - | - | - |
| Next.js | `@clerk/nextjs` | [Next.js SDK](/docs/references/nextjs/overview) |
| React Router | `@clerk/clerk-react-router` | [React Router SDK](/docs/references/react-router/overview) |
| Remix | `@clerk/remix` | [Remix SDK](/docs/references/remix/clerk-app) |
| Astro | `@clerk/astro` | [Astro SDK](/docs/references/astro/overview) |
| Tanstack Start | `@clerk/tanstack-start` | [Tanstack Start SDK](/docs/references/tanstack-start/overview) |

## Set up Clerk React

Before setting up Clerk React, create a Clerk application in the Clerk Dashboard. See the [setup guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) for instructions.

Once your Clerk application is created, install the Clerk React SDK. To get started, see the [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/react).
