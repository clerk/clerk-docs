Learn how to set up a social connection with LinkedIn in your Clerk application.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed. Simply navigate to the [Social Connections page](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections) in your Clerk Dashboard, toggle on the LinkedIn option, and click **Save**.

In production instances, you must provide custom credentials, which includes generating your own Client ID and Client Secret using your LinkedIn Developer account. Don't worry, this guide will walk you through that process in just a few simple steps.

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a LinkedIn account. To create one, [click here](https://developer.linkedin.com/).

## Configuration

<Steps>

### Create a LinkedIn application

To create a new OAuth LinkedIn app, go to the [LinkedIn Developer portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/) and click on the **Create app** button.

Once redirected to the application creation form, you need to set a name, associate a LinkedIn page with it, and upload a logo for your new application.

### LinkedIn + your Clerk app

You need to enable LinkedIn as a social connection for your Clerk application.

Navigate to the [Social Connections page](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections) in your Clerk Dashboard. Toggle on the LinkedIn option.

In the modal that opened, copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Keep this modal and page open.

### Configure LinkedIn application

Navigate back to your LinkedIn app and go to the **Auth** tab.

Paste the **Redirect URL** value you copied from the Clerk Dashboard into the **Authorized redirect URLs for your app** input in the **OAuth 2.0 settings** section.

Above that section, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the **Application credentials** section. Go back to the Clerk Dashboard, where the modal should still be open, and paste these values into the respective fields. If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard and click on the settings cog icon next to the LinkedIn option. You can now paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.
