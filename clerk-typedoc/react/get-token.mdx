Retrieves the current session token, waiting for Clerk to initialize if necessary.

This function is safe to call from anywhere in the browser, such as API interceptors,
data fetching layers, or vanilla JavaScript code.

**Note:** In frameworks with concurrent rendering (e.g., React 18+), a global token read
may not correspond to the currently committed UI during transitions. This is a coherence
consideration, not an auth safety issue.

## Parameters

| Parameter  | Type              | Description                                |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `options?` | `GetTokenOptions` | Optional configuration for token retrieval |

## Returns

`Promise`\<<code>null \| string</code>\> — A Promise that resolves to the session token, or `null` if the user is not signed in

## Throws

When called in a non-browser environment (code: `clerk_runtime_not_browser`)

## Throws

When Clerk fails to load within timeout (code: `clerk_runtime_load_timeout`)

## Throws

When the browser is offline and unable to fetch a token (code: `clerk_offline`).
Use `ClerkOfflineError.is(error)` to check for this error type.

## Example

```typescript
// In an Axios interceptor
import { getToken } from "@clerk/nextjs";

axios.interceptors.request.use(async (config) => {
  const token = await getToken();
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});
```
