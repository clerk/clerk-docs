title: Backend-only SDK
description: A reference for implementing a backend-only Clerk SDK
---

When creating a backend-only SDK, you have two options for implementing the [BAPI](/docs/guides/development/sdk-development/terminology) endpoints: either [develop a backend SDK that encompasses all BAPI endpoints](#implementation-bapi) or [create an SDK tailored for an existing backend framework](#implementation-node-js-backend-framework).

The source of truth for all BAPI endpoints is the [BAPI reference docs](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }}. For Node.js backend frameworks, you can build on top of the [JS Backend SDK](/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart).

## Expected features

- User only needs to provide their [Secret Key](/docs/guides/development/sdk-development/terminology)
- Centralized request authentication (e.g. in a middleware or plugin)
- Give access to the instance of BAPI client (so that users can use all methods)
- User should be able to limit access to routes by checking for [Roles and Permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/roles-and-permissions)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> BAPI has [rate limits](/docs/guides/how-clerk-works/system-limits) to help protect users against brute-force attacks or stop abuse of Clerk's platform. Be sure to include a backoff mechanism into your fetching logic and respect the `Retry-After` header to gracefully handle any active rate limits.

If you're using `@clerk/backend` to build an SDK for an existing framework, these additional features are expected:

- User should be able to use all `@clerk/backend` options

## Optional features

- User should be able to enforce authentication on individual routes (e.g. with a [`requireAuth`](/docs/guides/development/sdk-development/backend-only#create-a-require-auth-helper) helper)
- Use singleton pattern to only create a pre-configured instance of Clerk backend client

## Implementation: BAPI

You can manually create a wrapper library around the [BAPI OpenAPI](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} or use one the many automatic SDK generation tools that take in OpenAPI definitions.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're looking for a real-world example, have a look at [`clerk-sdk-go`](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-sdk-go).

## Implementation: Node.js backend framework

`@clerk/backend` is built for Node.js/V8 isolates (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Runtime, etc.). It’s the foundational package for all JavaScript Backend SDKs and works across all JavaScript runtimes. By using `@clerk/backend` you can be sure to communicate with Clerk’s BAPI in a correct and secure way.

> [!NOTE]
> The code blocks below will be written in pseudo-code. If you're looking for real-world examples, have a look at [`@clerk/fastify`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/tree/main/packages/fastify) and [`@clerk/express`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/tree/main/packages/express).

<Steps>
  ### Create a Clerk client

  Use [`createClerkClient`](/docs/getting-started/quickstart#usage) from `@clerk/backend` to create your default Clerk client which will be used for the middleware.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'client.ts' }}
  import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend'

  const API_VERSION = process.env.CLERK_API_VERSION || 'v1'
  const SECRET_KEY = process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY || ''
  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = process.env.CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY || ''
  const API_URL = process.env.CLERK_API_URL || ''
  const JWT_KEY = process.env.CLERK_JWT_KEY || ''
  const SDK_METADATA = {
    name: PACKAGE_NAME,
    version: PACKAGE_VERSION,
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  }

  export const clerkClient = createClerkClient({
    secretKey: SECRET_KEY,
    apiUrl: API_URL,
    apiVersion: API_VERSION,
    jwtKey: JWT_KEY,
    userAgent: `${PACKAGE_NAME}@${PACKAGE_VERSION}`,
    sdkMetadata: SDK_METADATA,
  })
  ```

  ### Create your middleware/plugin

  Inside the middleware, you’ll use the user-provided Clerk client (or use the default one created in the previous step) and authenticate the request. [`authenticateRequest`](/docs/reference/backend/authenticate-request) returns `Promise<RequestState>`. The middleware should set `requestState.toAuth()` into its context as this will contain the resolved signed-in/signed-out [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object. This way other helpers can access it later in the chain.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'clerk-middleware.ts' }}
  import { clerkClient as defaultClerkClient } from './client.ts'

  const clerkMiddleware = (options) => {
    return async (context, next) => {
      const clerkClient = options.clerkClient || defaultClerkClient

      const requestState = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(context.req, {
        authorizedParties: ['https://example.com'],
      })

      context.set('clerkAuth', requestState.toAuth())
      context.set('clerk', clerkClient)

      await next()
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Create a `getAuth` helper

  This utility will access the stored `requestState` (in the example above saved as `clerkAuth`) and return it.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'get-auth.ts' }}
  export const getAuth = (context) => context.get('clerkAuth')
  ```

  Your end-users can use this utility in cases like these:

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts', mark: [5, [7, 9]] }}
  const app = new Framework()

  app.use('*', clerkMiddleware())
  app.get('/', (context) => {
    const auth = getAuth(context)

    if (!auth?.userId) {
      return context.json({ message: 'Not logged in' })
    }

    return context.json({ message: 'Logged in', userId: auth.userId })
  })
  ```

  > [!TIP]
  > See the Next.js [`getAuth()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/pages-router/get-auth) reference to see how it's implemented.

  ### Create a `requireAuth` helper

  This utility will require auth requests for user authenticated or authorized requests. An HTTP `401` status code is returned for unauthorized requests.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'require-auth.ts' }}
  export const requireAuth = (context, next) => {
    if (!hasAuthObject(context)) {
      throw new Error('Middleware required')
    }
    if (!getAuth(context).userId) {
      context.status = 401
      return
    }
    return next()
  }
  ```

  Your end-users can use this utility in cases like these:

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts' }}
  const app = new Framework()

  app.get('/path', requireAuth())
  ```

  Your end-users will also have access to a [`has()`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#has) function on the [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object. They can combine it with `requireAuth()` like so:

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts' }}
  const app = new Framework()

  const hasPermission = (context, next) => {
    const auth = getAuth(context)
    if (!auth.has({ permission: 'org:feature:permission' })) {
      context.status = 403
      return
    }
    return next()
  }

  app.get('/path', requireAuth(), hasPermission())
  ```
</Steps>
