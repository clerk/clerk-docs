title: Verify the active user's permissions in an organization
description: A collection of utility functions and components in order to allow developers to perform authorization checks.
---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following authorization checks are predicated on a user having an active organization. Without this, they will likely always evaluate to false by default. Learn more about [active organizations](/docs/organizations/overview#active-organization). If you would like to perform authorization checks without using Clerk's organizations feature, see [the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) guide](/docs/guides/basic-rbac).

In general, you should always verify whether or not a user is authorized to access sensitive information, important content, or exclusive features. The most secure way to implement authorization is by checking the active user's [role or permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#permissions).

Clerk enables two broad approaches to role and permissions-based authorization:

1. If you would like to immediately prevent unauthorized users from accessing content, you can:
   - Use the [`<Protect>`](/docs/components/protect) component to prevent content from rendering if the active user is unauthorized.
   - Call [`auth.protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) to throw a `404` error if the active user is unauthorized.
1. If you would like more control over the response when a user is unauthorized, you can:
   - Call the [`has()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#has) helper, which returns `false` if the active user lacks the role or permissions you're checking for. You can _choose_ how your app responds instead of immediately preventing content from rendering or throwing an error.

## Authorization in Client Components

The following examples work for both SSR and CSR.

<Tabs items={["<Protect>", "has()"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example uses Clerk's `<Protect>` component to only render the form for users with the correct permission. The example uses the `fallback` prop to render a different UI if the user is not authorized.

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/form.tsx' }}
    'use client'
    import { Protect } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    export default function SettingsForm() {
      return (
        <Protect
          permission="org:team_settings:manage"
          fallback={<p>You are not allowed to see this section.</p>}
        >
          <form>{/* Add UI for managing team settings */}</form>
        </Protect>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The following example uses `has()` to inspect a user's permissions granularly. If the user doesn't have the permission, `has()` returns `false`, causing the component to return `null` instead of rendering its children.

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/form.tsx' }}
    'use client'
    import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    export default function SettingsForm() {
      const { has } = useAuth()

      if (!has) return null

      // Check if the user is authorized
      const canManageSettings = has({ permission: 'org:team_settings:manage' })

      // If has() returns false, the user does not have the correct permissions
      // You can choose how your app responds. This example returns null.
      if (!canManageSettings) return null

      // If the user is both authenticated and authorized, move forward with your logic
      return <form>{/* Add UI for managing team settings */}</form>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authorization in React Server Components

<Tabs items={["<Protect>", "has()", "auth.protect()"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example uses Clerk's `<Protect>` component to only render the layout for users with the correct permission. If the user is not authorized, the component will not render its children.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Be cautious when doing authorization checks in layouts, as these don't re-render on navigation, meaning the user session won't be checked on every route change. [Read more in the Next.js docs.](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/authentication#layouts-and-auth-checks)

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/layout.tsx' }}
    import type { PropsWithChildren } from 'react'
    import { Protect } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    export default function SettingsLayout(props: PropsWithChildren) {
      return <Protect permission="org:team_settings:read">{props.children}</Protect>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The following example uses `has()` to inspect a user's permissions granularly. If the user doesn't have the correct permission, `has()` returns `false`, causing the component to return `null` instead of rendering its children.

    > [!WARNING]
    > Be cautious when doing authorization checks in layouts, as these don't re-render on navigation, meaning the user session won't be checked on every route change. [Read more in the Next.js docs.](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/authentication#layouts-and-auth-checks)

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/layout.tsx' }}
    import type { PropsWithChildren } from 'react'
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default async function SettingsLayout(props: PropsWithChildren) {
      const { has } = await auth()

      // Check if the user is authorized
      const canAccessSettings = has({ permission: 'org:team_settings:read' })

      // If has() returns false, the user does not have the correct permissions
      // You can choose how your app responds. This example returns null.
      if (!canAccessSettings) return null

      return props.children
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    > [!WARNING]
    > [`auth.protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) is only available for App Router, and only works on the server-side.

    The following example uses [`auth.protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) to protect a RSC from unauthenticated and unauthorized access.

    - If the user is not authenticated, `auth.protect()` will redirect the user to the sign-in route.
    - If the user is authenticated but is not authorized (as in, does not have the `org:team_settings:read` permission), `auth.protect()` will throw a `404` error.
    - If the user is both authenticated and authorized, `auth.protect()` will return the user's `userId`.

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx' }}
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default async function Page() {
      const { userId } = await auth.protect({ permission: 'org:team_settings:read' })

      return <p>{userId} is authorized to access this page.</p>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authorization in endpoints

<Tabs items={["Next.js Server Actions", "Next.js Route Handlers", "Next.js Pages Router"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example uses `has()` to inspect a user's permissions granularly in a Next.js Server Action. If the user doesn't have the correct permission, `has()` returns `false`, causing the Server Action to return a `403` error.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/components/ExampleServerComponent.tsx' }}
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default async function ExampleServerComponent() {
      async function myServerAction(formData: FormData) {
        'use server'
        const { has } = await auth()

        // Check if the user is authorized
        const canManage = has({ permission: 'org:team_settings:manage' })

        // If has() returns false, the user does not have the correct permissions
        // You can choose how your app responds. This example returns a 403 error.
        if (!canManage)
          return Response.json({ error: 'User does not have the correct permissions' }, { status: 403 })

        // If the user is both authenticated and authorized, move forward with your logic
        return users.getTeams(userId)
      }

      return (
        <form action={myServerAction}>
          {/* Add UI for managing team settings */}
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Tabs items={["has()", "auth.protect()"]}>
      <Tab>
        The following example demonstrates how to use `has()` in a Next.js Route Handler.

        The example:

        - uses the `userId` returned from [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) to check if the user is signed in. If the user is not **authenticated**, the Route Handler will return a `401` error.
        - uses `has()` to check if the user has the correct permission. If the user is not **authorized**, `has()` will return false, causing the Route Handler to return a `403` error.

        ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/api/get-teams/route.tsx' }}
        import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

        export const GET = async () => {
          const { userId, has } = await auth()

          // Check if the user is authenticated
          if (!userId) {
            return Response.json({ error: 'User is not signed in' }, { status: 401 })
          }

          // Check if the user is authorized
          const canRead = has({ permission: 'org:team_settings:read' })

          // If has() returns false, the user does not have the correct permissions
          // You can choose how your app responds. This example returns a 403 error.
          if (!canRead)
            return Response.json({ error: 'User does not have the correct permissions' }, { status: 403 })

          // If the user is both authenticated and authorized, move forward with your logic
          return users.getTeams(userId)
        }
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab>
        > [!WARNING]
        > [`auth.protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) is only available for App Router, and only works on the server-side.

        The following example uses [`auth.protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) to protect a Next.js Route Handler from unauthenticated and unauthorized access.

        - If the user is not authenticated nor authorized (as in, does not have the `org:team_settings:manage` permission), `auth.protect()` will throw a `404` error.
        - If the user is both authenticated and authorized, `auth.protect()` will return the user's `userId`.

        ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/api/create-team/route.tsx' }}
        import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

        export const GET = async () => {
          const { userId } = await auth.protect({
            permission: 'org:team_settings:manage',
          })

          return Response.json({ userId })
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    Use the [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) helper to access the `has()` helper in a Next.js Pages Router application.

    The following example:

    - uses the `userId` returned from `getAuth()` to check if the user is signed in. If the user is not **authenticated**, the route will return a `401` error.
    - uses `has()` to check if the user has the correct permission. If the user is not **authorized**, `has()` will return false, causing the route to return a `403` error.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/pages/api/get-teams.ts' }}
    import { getAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest) {
      const { userId, has } = await getAuth(req)

      // Check if the user is authenticated
      if (!userId) return res.status(401)

      // Check if the user is authorized
      const canRead = has({ permission: 'org:team_settings:read' })

      // If has() returns false, the user does not have the correct permissions
      // You can choose how your app responds. This example returns a 403 error.
      if (!canRead) return res.status(403)

      // If the user is both authenticated and authorized, move forward with your logic
      return users.getTeams(userId)
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authorization in Remix Loaders

The following example uses the [`has()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#has) helper to check if the user has the correct permission. If the user is not authorized, `has()` will return false, causing the loader to redirect the user to the `/request-access` route.

<Tabs items={["Remix"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```tsx
    export const loader: LoaderFunction = async (args) => {
      const { has } = await getAuth(args)

      if (has({ permission: 'org:team_settings:manage' }) === false) {
        return redirect('/request-access')
      }

      return {}
    }

    export default function Settings() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Settings Page</h1>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authorization in JavaScript

If you are not using React or any of the meta-frameworks we support, you can use the [Clerk JavaScript SDK](/docs/references/javascript/overview). The following example demonstrates how to use the [`checkAuthorization()`](/docs/references/javascript/session#check-authorization) method to check if a user is authorized.

<Tabs items={["JavaScript"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```tsx {{ filename: 'main.js' }}
    import { Clerk } from '@clerk/clerk-js'

    // Initialize Clerk with your Clerk publishable key
    const clerk = new Clerk('{{pub_key}}')
    await clerk.load()

    // Check if the user is authenticated
    if (clerk.user) {
      // Check if the user is authorized
      const canManageSettings = clerk.session.checkAuthorization({
        permission: 'org:team_settings:manage',
      })
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authorize with roles

> [!WARNING]
> It's best practice to use permission-based authorization over role-based authorization, as it reduces complexity and increases security. Usually, complex role checks can be refactored with a single permission check.

You can pass a `role` the same way you can pass a `permission` in all the examples above.

<Tabs items={[ "RSC with <Protect>", "RSC with auth.protect()", "Client Component with has()", ]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example uses `<Protect>`'s `condition` prop to conditionally render its children if the user has the correct role.

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/Page.tsx' }}
    import { Protect } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    export default function Page() {
      return (
        <Protect
          condition={(has) => has({ role: 'org:admin' }) || has({ role: 'org:billing_manager' })}
        >
          <p>Admin settings</p>
        </Protect>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    > [!WARNING]
    > [`auth.protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) is only available for App Router, and only works on the server-side.

    The following example uses [`auth.protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) to protect a RSC from unauthenticated and unauthorized access.

    - If the user is not authenticated, `auth.protect()` will redirect the user to the sign-in route.
    - If the user is authenticated but is not authorized (as in, does not have the `org:admin` or `org:billing_manager` role), `auth.protect()` will throw a `404` error.
    - If the user is both authenticated and authorized, `auth.protect()` will return the user's `userId`.

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx' }}
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default async function Page() {
      const { userId } = await auth.protect(
        (has) => has({ role: 'org:admin' }) || has({ role: 'org:billing_manager' }),
      )

      return <p>{userId} is authorized to access this page.</p>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The following example uses `has()` to inspect a user's roles granularly. If the user doesn't have the correct role, `has()` returns `false`, causing the component to return `null` instead of rendering its children.

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/form.tsx' }}
    'use client'
    import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    export function SettingsForm() {
      const { has } = useAuth()

      // Check if the user is authorized
      const canAccessSettings = has({ role: 'org:admin' }) || has({ role: 'org:billing_manager' })

      // If has() returns false, the user does not have the correct permissions
      // You can choose how your app responds. This example returns null.
      if (!canAccessSettings) return null

      // If the user is both authenticated and authorized, move forward with your logic
      return <form>{/* Add UI for team settings */}</form>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How to add types for roles and permissions

In order to enhance typesafety in your project, you can define a global `ClerkAuthorization` interface, which defines the acceptable values for roles and permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, roles and permission types, such as `OrganizationCustomRoleKey` and `OrganizationCustomPermissionKey`, are assigned `string`. However, if a `ClerkAuthorization` type is defined, it will be utilized instead.

In the example below, `ClerkAuthorization` is defined with the default roles that Clerk provides.

```tsx {{ filename: 'types/globals.d.ts' }}
export {}

declare global {
  interface ClerkAuthorization {
    permission: ''
    role: 'org:admin' | 'org:member'
  }
}
```

Because Clerk supports custom roles and permissions, you can modify `ClerkAuthorization` to align with the roles and permissions configured in your Clerk application. See how in the example below, the default Clerk roles `org:admin` and `org:member` are replaced with custom roles `org:super_admin`, `org:teacher`, and `org:student`.

```tsx {{ filename: 'types/globals.d.ts' }}
export {}

declare global {
  interface ClerkAuthorization {
    permission: 'org:quiz:create' | 'org:quiz:grade' | 'org:quiz:read' | 'org:quiz:fill'
    role: 'org:super_admin' | 'org:teacher' | 'org:student'
  }
}
```
