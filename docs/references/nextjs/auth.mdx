# `auth()`

The `auth()` helper returns the [`Auth`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object) object of the currently active user. This is the same `Auth` object that is returned by the [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) hook. However, it can be used in Server Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions.

The `auth()` helper does require [Middleware](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware).

## Returns

`auth()` returns the [`Auth`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object) object with a few extra properties:

- [`protect()`](#protect)
- [`redirectToSignIn()`](#redirect-to-sign-in)

### `protect()`

You can use the `protect()` helper to check if a user is authorized to access something, such as a component or a route handler.

`protect()` will return the `Authentication` object if the user is authorized. If the user is not authorized, it will throw a `notFound` Next.js error.

<Callout type="warning">
  `auth().protect()` only works for App Router and is considered experimental.
</Callout>

You can use the `protect()` helper in two ways:
- to check if a user is authenticated
- to check if a user is authorized to access something, such as a component or a route handler

`protect()` will return the `Auth` object if the user is authenticated or authorized. If the user is not authenticated or authorized, `protect()` will redirect the user to the sign-in page or to a custom URL that you provide as a parameter.

`protect()` accepts the following parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `role?` | `string` | The role to check for. |
| `permission?` | `string` | The permission to check for. |
| `has?` | <code>(isAuthorizedParams: CheckAuthorizationParamsWithCustomPermissions) => boolean</code> | A function that returns a boolean based on the permission or role provided as parameter. Can be used for authorization. See the dedicated [`has()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#has) section for more information. |
| `unauthorizedUrl?` | `string` | The URL to redirect the user to if they are not authorized. |
| `unauthenticatedUrl?` | `string` | The URL to redirect the user to if they are not authenticated. |

### `redirectToSignIn()`

`redirectToSignIn()` is a method that redirects the user to the sign-in page. It accepts the following parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `returnBackUrl?` | `string \| URL` | The URL to redirect the user back to after they sign in. |

## Use `auth()` to retrieve `userId`

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

export default function Page() {
const { userId } : { userId: string | null } = auth();
// ...
}
```

## Use `auth()` for data fetching

When using a Clerk integration, or if you need to send a JWT along to a server, you can use the `getToken` function.

```tsx filename="app/api/example/route.ts"
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

export async function GET() {
  const {userId, getToken} = auth();

  if(!userId){
    return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });
  }

  try {
    const token = await getToken({template: "supabase"});

    // Add logic here to fetch data from Supabase and return it.

    const data = { supabaseData: 'Hello World' };

    return Response.json({ data });
  } catch (error) {
    return Response.json(error);
  }
}
```

## Use `auth()` to check if a user is authenticated

`auth().protect()` can be used in a `layout.tsx` file to protect the entire route, including all children.

In the following example,
- the `protect()` helper is used to check if a user visiting any `/dashboard` route is authenticated.
- If the user is not authenticated, they will be redirected to the sign-in route.
- If the user is authenticated, they can view any `/dashboard` route and its children.

```tsx filename="app/dashboard/layout.tsx"
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default async function Layout({ children }:{ children: React.ReactNode }){
  auth().protect()

  return <>{children}</>
}
```

## Use `auth()` to check if a user is authorized

`auth()` returns the [`Auth`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#auth-object) object, which includes the `has()` helper. `auth()` also returns the `protect()` helper.

`has()` and `protect()` can be used to check if a user is authorized to access certain parts of your application.

### Use `has()` to check if a user is authorized

Use the [`has()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#has) helper in order to check if a user is authorized to access a component.

In the following example:
- `has()` is used to check if a user has the `org:team_settings:manage` permission.
- If the user does not have the permission, `null` is returned.
- If the user has the permission, the component will return the "Team Settings" heading.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

export default async function Page() {
  const { has } = auth();

  const canManage = has({ permission:"org:team_settings:manage" });

  if(!canManage) return null;

  return <h1>Team Settings</h1>
}
```

### Use `protect()` to check if a user is authorized

Use the [`protect()`](#protect) helper to protect a route handler from unauthorized access.

<Callout type="warning">
  `auth().protect()` only works for App Router and is considered experimental.
</Callout>

In the following example:
- `protect()` helper is used to check if a user is authorized to access a route handler.
- If the user is not authorized, the `protect()` helper will redirect the user to the sign-in route.
- If the user is authorized, the `protect()` helper will return the `Auth` object, which has the `userId` property.

```tsx filename="app/api/route.ts"
import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export const POST = () => {
  const { userId } = auth().protect({ permission: "org:team_settings:manage" });

  return users.createTeam(userId);
}
```

## Use `auth()` to check your current user's role

In some cases, you need to check your user's current organization role before displaying data or allowing certain actions to be performed.

Check the current user's role with the `orgRole` property of the `Auth` object returned by `auth()`, as shown in the following example:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';

export default async function Page() {
  const { orgRole } = auth();
  return (
    <>
      <div>Your current role is {orgRole}</div>
    </>
  )
}
```
