description: Learn how to add custom sign-in-or-up page to your Expo web app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
sdk: expo
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in) prebuilt component in order to build custom page that **allows users to sign in or sign up within a single flow**.

To set up separate sign-in and sign-up pages, follow this guide, and then follow the [custom sign-up page guide](/docs/guides/development/web-support/custom-sign-up-page).

This guide uses [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) and the [platform-specific extensions](https://docs.expo.dev/router/create-pages/#platform-specific-extensions) to build the sign-in-or-up page specifically for the **web** platform.

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-in-or-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in) component to allow users to both sign-in or sign-up from a single flow.

  ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/sign-in.web.tsx' }}
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/clerk-expo/web'

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignIn />
  }
  ```

  ## Visit your new page

  To run your project, use the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run web
  ```

  Visit your new custom pages locally at [localhost:8081/sign-in](http://localhost:8081/sign-in).
