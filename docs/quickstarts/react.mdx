</TutorialHero>

<Steps>
  ### Set up a React application using Vite

  Scaffold your new React application using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm create vite@latest clerk-react -- --template react-ts
    cd clerk-react
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn create vite clerk-react --template react-ts
    cd clerk-react
    yarn install
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm create vite clerk-react --template react-ts
    cd clerk-react
    pnpm install
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Install `@clerk/clerk-react`

  Clerk's [React SDK](/docs/references/react/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, hooks, and helpers for React.

  To get started using Clerk with React, add the SDK to your project:

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn",  "pnpm" ]}>
    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/clerk-react
    ```

    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/clerk-react
    ```

    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/clerk-react
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your environment variables

  1. If you don't have an `.env.local` file in the root directory of your React project, create one now.
  1. Find your Clerk publishable key. If you're signed into Clerk, the `.env.local` snippet below will contain your key. Otherwise:

  - Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) and select your application.
  - In the navigation sidebar, select **API Keys**.
  - You can copy your key from the **Quick Copy** section.

  3. Add your key to your `.env.local` file.

  The final result should look as follows:

  <InjectKeys>
    ```env {{ prettier: false, filename: '.env.local' }}
    VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
    ```
  </InjectKeys>

  ### Import the Clerk publishable key

  You will need to import your Clerk publishable key into your application. You can add an `if` statement to check that it is imported and that it exists. This will prevent running the application without the publishable key, and will also prevent TypeScript errors.

  ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [[6, 7], [9, 11]] }}
  import React from 'react'
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
  import App from './App.tsx'
  import './index.css'

  // Import your publishable key
  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
    throw new Error("Missing Publishable Key")
  }

  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
    </React.StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

  ### Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your app

  All Clerk hooks and components must be children of the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component, which provides active session and user context.

  To make this data available across your entire app, wrap your app in the `<ClerkProvider>` component. You **must** pass your publishable key as a prop to the `<ClerkProvider>` component.

  ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [5, 16, 18] }}
  import React from 'react'
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
  import App from './App.tsx'
  import './index.css'
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

  // Import your publishable key
  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
    throw new Error("Missing Publishable Key")
  }

  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY} afterSignOutUrl="/">
        <App />
      </ClerkProvider>
    </React.StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

  ### Create a header with Clerk components

  You can control which content signed in and signed out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview). To get started, create a header for your users to sign in or out. To do this, you will use:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button): A prebuilt component that comes styled out of the box to show the avatar from the account the user is signed in with.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page or displays the sign-in modal.

  ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'src/App.tsx', mark: [1, [6, 11]] }}
  import { SignedIn, SignedOut, SignInButton, UserButton } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

  export default function App() {
    return (
      <header>
        <SignedOut>
          <SignInButton />
        </SignedOut>
        <SignedIn>
          <UserButton />
        </SignedIn>
      </header>
    )
  }
  ```

  Then, visit your app's homepage at [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) while signed out to see the sign-in button. Once signed in, your app will render the user button.

## Next step: Add routing with React Router

React has many options for handling routing, and you are free to choose the option that suits you best. If you would like to learn how to integrate React Router's latest Data API-based router (nicknamed Data Router), please see the [Add React Router to your Clerk Powered application](/docs/references/react/add-react-router) guide.
