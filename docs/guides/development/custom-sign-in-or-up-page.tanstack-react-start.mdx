title: Build your own sign-in-or-up page for your TanStack React Start app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add a custom sign-in-or-up page to your TanStack React Start app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
sdk: tanstack-react-start
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in) component to build a custom page **that allows users to sign in or sign up within a single flow**.

To set up separate sign-in and sign-up pages, follow this guide, and then follow the [custom sign-up page guide](/docs/tanstack-react-start/guides/development/custom-sign-up-page).

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-in-or-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in) component on a dedicated page using the [TanStack Router catch-all route](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/routing/routing-concepts#splat--catch-all-routes).

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/routes/sign-in.$.tsx' }}
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/tanstack-react-start'
  import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/sign-in/$')({
    component: Page,
  })

  function Page() {
    return <SignIn />
  }
  ```

  ## Configure your sign-in-or-up page

  Set the `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` environment variable to tell Clerk where the `<SignIn />` component is being hosted.

  There are other environment variables that you can set to customize Clerk's redirect behavior, such as `CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL`. Learn more about these environment variables and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/development/customize-redirect-urls).

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  ```

  ## Visit your new page

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-in](http://localhost:3000/sign-in).
