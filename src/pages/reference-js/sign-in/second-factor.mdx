# First Factor

These are all methods on [the `SignIn` class](/reference-js/sign-in/sign-in) that allow you to handle the second factor of a multi-factor authentication flow.

## `prepareSecondFactor()`

```
prepareSecondFactor(params: PrepareSecondFactorParams) => Promise<SignIn>
```

Begins the second factor verification process. This step is optional in order to complete a sign in.

A common scenario for the second step verification (2FA) is to require a one-time code (OTP) as proof of identity. This is determined by the accepted `strategy` parameter values. Each authentication identifier supports different strategies.

Note: while th `phone_code` strategy requires preparation, the `totp` strategy does not - the user can directly attempt the second factor verification in that case.

### `PrepareSecondFactorParams`

| Name     | Type   | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| strategy | string | The strategy used for verification. Each authentication identifier supports different verification strategies. Possible strategy values for second factor preparation are:**phone_code**: User will receive a one-time authentication code in their phone, via SMS. The SMS message will be sent to the user's phone number that was added when setting up 2FA.The `totp` strategy requires the user to have registered their secret on an authenticator app, which then periodically generates TOTPs, without the need for a preparation step. |

### Returns

| Type                    | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| {"Promise<SignInResource>"} | This method returns a `Promise` which resolves with a `SignIn` object. Check the `secondFactorVerification` attribute for the status of the second factor verification process. |

## `attemptSecondFactor()`

```
attemptSecondFactor(params: AttemptSecondFactorParams) => Promise<SignIn>
```

Attempts to complete the second factor verification process (2FA). This step is optional in order to complete a sign in.

For the `phone_code` strategy, make sure that a verification has already been prepared before you call this method, by first calling `SignIn.prepareSecondFactor`. Depending on the strategy that was selected when the verification was prepared, the method parameters should be different.

The `totp` strategy can directly be attempted, without the need for preparation.

### `AttemptSecondFactorParams`

| Name     | Type   | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| strategy | string | The strategy to be used for second factor verification. Possible `strategy` values are:**phone_code**: User will receive a one-time authentication code in their phone, via SMS. At least one phone number should be on file for the user.**totp**: User must provide a 6-digit TOTP code generated by their authenticator app. The user will need to have created a TOTP secret beforehand so as to register it on their authentictor app via QR code, URI or even entering the secret itself. |
| code     | string | For the `phone_code` strategy: The one-time code that was sent to the user as part of the prepareSecondFactor step.For the `totp` strategy: The TOTP generated by the user's authenticator app. |

### Returns

| Type                    | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| {"Promise<SignInResource>"} | This method returns a `Promise` which resolves with a `SignIn` object. Check the `secondFactorVerification` attribute for the status of the second factor verification process. |
