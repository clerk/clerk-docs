- Use Clerk to authenticate access to your Firebase data.
- Configure your Firebase Clerk integration.

</TutorialHero>

Integrating Firebase with Clerk gives you the benefits of using Firebase's NoSQL database while leveraging Clerk's authentication, prebuilt components, and webhooks.

<Steps>

### Configure the integration 

To get started:
1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
1. In the sidebar, select **[Integrations](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=integrations)**, and toggle the Firebase integration on.

The Firebase integration enables you to use Clerk to generate a valid authentication token to send to Firebase's API. To do so, you can upload your Firebase project's service account key JSON file to configure the integration automatically.

To generate a service account key:

1. Visit [the Service Accounts settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk) in your Firebase project.
1. Near the bottom of the page, select **Generate New Private Key** and save the file.

See [the manual configuration instructions](#configure-firebase-manually) if you don't want to use a service account key.

### Enable authentication in Firebase

To use Firebase auth, ensure authentication is enabled in your Firebase dashboard. To do so:

1. Navigate to your Firebase dashboard.
1. In the sidebar navigation, expand **Build** and select **Authentication**.
1. Enable authentication on this page, and enable any sign-in method you want, such as **Email/Password**.

### Add a Security Rule to your Firestore database

To use Firestore with Clerk, ensure that you have defined [Security Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started) that allow authenticated requests to access your database. For example:

```bash
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Get your Firebase config object

To connect to your Firebase app in your code, you need a config object from your Firebase project. To find it:

1. Visit [your Firebase project settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general/).
1. Scroll down to the setup code snippet on this page, and copy the config. It should be similar to the following:
    ```typescript
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      authDomain: "clerk-example-xxxxx.firebaseapp.com",
      databaseURL: "https://clerk-example-xxxxx-default-xxxx.firebaseio.com",
      projectId: "clerk-test-xxxx",
      storageBucket: "clerk-test-xxxx.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "012345678910",
      appId: "1:012345678:web:abcdef123456hijklm",
      measurementId: "G-ABC123DEF"
    };
    ```
1. Save this information somewhere secure. You'll need it to connect to your Firebase app.

See [Google's Firebase documentation](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592) for more information on the config object.

### Use Firebase with Clerk in your code

The following example:
- Uses Clerk to generate an authentication token for Firebase's API.
- Creates a button for signing into your Firebase app.
- Creates a button for fetching example data from your Firestore database.

```tsx filename="app/firebase/page.tsx"
"use client";
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth, signInWithCustomToken } from "firebase/auth";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
import { doc, getDoc } from "firebase/firestore";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  authDomain: "clerk-example-xxxxx.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://clerk-example-xxxxx-default-xxxx.firebaseio.com",
  projectId: "clerk-test-xxxx",
  storageBucket: "clerk-test-xxxx.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "012345678910",
  appId: "1:012345678:web:abcdef123456hijklm",
  measurementId: "G-ABC123DEF",
};

// Connect to your Firebase app
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
// Connect to your Firestore database
const db = getFirestore(app);
const auth = getAuth(app);

const getFirestoreData = async () => {
  const docRef = doc(db, "example", "example-document");
  const docSnap = await getDoc(docRef);
  if (docSnap.exists()) {
    console.log("Document data:", docSnap.data());
  } else {
    // docSnap.data() will be undefined in this case
    console.log("No such document!");
  }
};

export default function FirebaseUI() {
  const { getToken } = useAuth();
  const signInWithClerk = async () => {
    console.log("Sign in with clerk");
    const token = await getToken({ template: "integration_firebase" });
    const userCredentials = await signInWithCustomToken(auth, token || "");
     // The userCredentials.user object can call the methods of
     // the Firebase platform as an authenticated user.
    console.log("User:", userCredentials.user);
  };

  return (
    <main style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", rowGap: "1rem" }}>
      <button onClick={signInWithClerk}>Sign in</button>
      <button onClick={getFirestoreData}>Get document</button>
    </main>
  );
}
```
</Steps>

## Configure Firebase manually

You should use a service account key to [configure your integration automatically](#configure-your-project).

If you want to manually configure your Firebase integration, you must provide Clerk with the following information about your Firebase project:

- **Service account email** – Find this in your Firebase project's [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?consoleUI=FIREBASE&hl=fi&supportedpurview=project), or in the `client_email` field of your service account key JSON file.
- **Firestore project ID** – Find this under **Project Settings** in the Firebase dashboard, or in the `project_id` field of your service account key JSON file.
- **Private Key** – You can [generate this manually](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/auth-server#:~:text=In%20the%20Firebase%20console%2C%20open,confirm%20by%20clicking%20Generate%20Key.), or find it in the `private_key` field of your service account key JSON file.
- **Firebase database URL** *(Optional)* – To find this:
  - In the Firebase dashboard, select **Realtime Database**
  - Select the **Data** tab, and select the copy button to add the database URL to your clipboard
