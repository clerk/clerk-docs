Add the Clerk Android SDK to your application's dependencies:

```gradle
dependencies {
   ...
   implementation("com.clerk:clerk-android:<latest-version>")
   ...
}
```

## Configure Clerk

Before using any part of the Clerk SDK, you must call `initialize` to set the application context, which is used for registering activities/receivers/deeplinks.

1. Import the Global `Clerk` object
1. Call `Clerk.initialize`
1. Pass in your application context and publishable key.

From an Application Class:

```kotlin {{ filename: 'App.kt', mark: [1, [7, 10]] }}
import.com.clerk.Clerk

class App: Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
      super.onCreate()
      ...
      Clerk.initialize(
          this,
          publishableKey = "pk_test..."
      )
      ...
    }
}
```
