title: Email/SMS OTP (One-time Password)
description: Learn how to send one-time codes (OTP) to authenticate users.
---

Clerk supports passwordless authentication, which lets users sign in and sign up without having to remember a password. During sign-in, users will be asked to enter their identifier (email address or phone number) to receive a one-time password (OTP), also referred to as a one-time code, and complete the authentication process.

Arguably, passwordless authentication provides greater security and a better user experience than traditional passwords. However, it is not without its downsides, and often still boils down to the email providers "knowledge based factor" instead of yours.

There are multiple ways to set up passwordless authentication in Clerk such as using [Clerk Components](/docs/components/overview), or by creating a [custom flow](#custom-flow) using Clerk's SDKs.

The rest of this guide will explain how to set up passwordless authentication using any of the above methods. Before you start, you will need to [configure](#configuration) your instance to allow passwordless sign-ins.

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) guide.
- You need to install the correct SDK for your application. You can find steps on how to do so through Clerk's [quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/overview) guides.

## Set up passwordless authentication for your Clerk application

To enable passwordless authentication, you need to configure your instance to allow passwordless sign-ins. You can do this through the Clerk Dashboard or by creating a custom flow using the Clerk API.

### Enable passwordless authentication in the Clerk Dashboard

Passwordless authentication can be configured through the Clerk Dashboard. Go to **User & Authentication > [Email, Phone, and Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username)**. In the **Authentication strategies** section of this page, choose one of the available passwordless authentication strategies that send one-time codes.

For more information on how to configure passwordless authentication, check out the [Sign-in and sign-up options](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#authentication-strategies) guide.

### Enable passwordless authentication using the Clerk API

In case one of the above integration methods doesn't cover your needs, you can make use of lower-level commands and create a completely custom passwordless authentication flow.

<Callout type="warning">
  You still need to configure your instance in order to enable passwordless authentication, as described at the top of this guide.
</Callout>

#### Sign up using a custom flow (Clerk API)

The passwordless sign-up flow is a process that requires users to provide their authentication identifier (email address or phone number) and a one-time code that is sent to them. The important thing to note here is that a user's email address or phone number needs to be verified before the registration is completed.

A successful sign-up consists of the following steps:

- Initiate the sign-up process by collecting the user's identifier (email address or phone number).
- Prepare the identifier verification.
- Attempt to complete the identifier verification.

Let's see the above in action. If you want to learn more about sign-ups, check out our documentation on Clerk's [sign-up flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview#sign-up-flow).

You can also verify your users via their email address. There's two additional helper methods: [`prepareEmailAddressVerification`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/email-verification#prepare-email-address-verification) and [`attemptEmailAddressVerification`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/email-verification#attempt-email-address-verification) that work the same way as their phone number counterparts do. You can find all available methods in the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object documentation.

#### Sign in using a custom flow (Clerk API)

The passwordless sign-in flow is a process that requires users to provide their authentication identifier (email address or phone number) and subsequently a one-time code that is sent to them. We call this one-time code the first factor of authentication.

So, in essence, when you want to authenticate users in your application, you need to

- Initiate the sign-in process by collecting the user's authentication identifier.
- Prepare the first factor verification.
- Attempt to complete the first factor verification.

Let's see the above in action. If you want to learn more about sign-ins, check out our documentation on Clerk's [sign-in flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview#sign-in-flow).

You can also achieve passwordless sign-ins with an email address. Simply pass the value `email_code` as the first factor strategy. Just make sure you've collected the user's email address first. You can find all available methods in the [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object documentation.
