> [!WARNING]
> If you're using Duo as an authenticator app, please note that Duo generates TOTP codes differently than other authenticator apps. Duo allows a code to be valid for 30 seconds from _the moment it is first displayed_, which may cause frequent `invalid_code` errors if the code is not entered promptly. More information can be found in [Duo's Help Center](https://help.duo.com/s/article/2107).
