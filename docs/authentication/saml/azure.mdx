  - Use Microsoft Azure Entra ID to enable SSO via SAML for your Clerk app.
</TutorialHero>

Enabling single sign-on (SSO) with **Microsoft Azure Entra ID** (formerly [Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/new-name)) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Microsoft account.

In _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials, which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your Microsoft Entra ID dashboard account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

<Steps>
  ### Set up an enterprise connection in Clerk

  To create a SAML connection in Clerk:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For specific domains**.
  1. In the modal that opens, select **Microsoft Entra ID (Formerly AD)** as the identity provider.
  1. Add the **Name** of the connection. This is the name that will be displayed on the sign-in form.
  1. Enter the **Specific Domain** that you want to allow this connection for. This is the domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your app.
  1. Select **Add connection**. You'll be redirected to the connection's configuration page.
  1. Find the **Service Provider Configuration** section.
  1. Save the **Identifier (Entity ID)** and **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** values somewhere secure. You'll need these in the [Configure your service provider](#configure-your-service-provider) step. Leave this page open.

  ### Create a new enterprise app in Microsoft

  To create a new enterprise app in Microsoft:

  1. In a separate page, navigate to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/azure-portal) and sign in.
  1. Under the **Azure Services** section, find and select **Enterprise applications**. You may have to go to the [**All services**](https://portal.azure.com/#allservices) page and then scroll down to the **Identity** section to find it.
  1. Select **New application**. You'll be redirected to the **Browse Microsoft Entra Gallery** page.
  1. Select **Create your own application**.
  1. In the modal that opens:

  - Enter the **Name** of your app.
  - Ensure the option **Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)** is selected.
  - Select **Create**.

  ### Assign selected user or group in Microsoft

  Now that you have created the enterprise app, you need to assign users or groups to the app. For example, if you were part of the Clerk organization, you would have access to users and groups within the Clerk organization. In this case, you could assign individual users or entire groups to the enterprise app you just created.

  1. In the **Getting Started** section, select the **Assign users and groups** link.
  1. Select **Add user/group**. You'll be redirected to the **Add Assignment** page.
  1. Select the **None Selected** link.
  1. To assign a user to the enterprise app, you can either use the search field to find a user or select the checkbox next to the user in the table.
  1. Select **Select** at the bottom of the page. You'll be redirected to the **Add Assignment** page.
  1. Select **Assign** at the bottom of the page.

  ### Configure SSO in Microsoft

  After assigning the user or group to the enterprise app, you need to configure the SSO settings to enable SAML SSO.

  1. In the navigation sidebar, open the **Manage** dropdown and select **Single sign-on**.
  1. In the **Select a single sign-on method** section, select **SAML**.

  ### Configure your service provider

  To configure Clerk as your service provider, add these two fields to your IdP's application:

  - **Identifier (Entity ID)** - A unique identifier for your SAML connection, required by your IdP app.
  - **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** - The URL of your app where your IdP will redirect your users after they authenticate.

  To complete the following values for these fields:

  1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, find the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.
  1. Select **Edit** to open the **Basic SAML Configuration** panel.
  1. Paste the **Identifier (Entity ID)** and **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** values you saved earlier into their respective fields. These values will be saved automatically.
  1. Select **Save** at the top of the panel. Close the panel.

  ### Configure your identity provider

  To configure Microsoft Entra ID as your identity provider, add the following fields to your app:

  1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, find the **SAML Certificates** section.
  1. Copy the **App Federation Metadata Url**.
  1. Navigate back to the **Clerk Dashboard**. In the **Identity Provider Configuration** section, under **App Federation Metadata Url**, paste the **App Federation Metadata URL**.
  1. Select **Fetch & save**.

  ### Map Microsoft claims to Clerk attributes

  Mapping the claims in your IdP to the attributes in Clerk ensures that the data from your IdP is correctly mapped to the data in Clerk.

  | Clerk attribute | Microsoft claim |
  | - | - |
  | `mail` | `user.userprincipalname` |
  | `firstName` | `user.givenname` |
  | `lastName` | `user.surname` |

  The only Microsoft claim that is necessary to map is the email address claim. This is the email address that your users will use to log in to your app.

  1. Navigate back to the Microsoft Azure portal.
  1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, find the **Attributes & Claims** section.
  1. Select **Edit**.
  1. To edit the email claim, select the claim with the value of `user.email`. You'll be redirected to the **Manage claim** page.
  1. Next to **Source attribute**, search and select the dropdown and choose `user.userprincipalname`.
  1. Select **Save** at the top of the page.

  ### Enable the connection for Clerk

  To make the connection available for your users to authenticate with:

  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where you should still have the connection's configuration page open. If not, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page and select the connection.
  1. At the top of the page, toggle on **Enable connection** and select **Save**.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal) page.
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:

     - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
     - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
  1. Sign in with your Microsoft account.
