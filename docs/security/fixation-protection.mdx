# Fixation protection

Session Fixation is an attack that permits an attacker to hijack a valid user session. The attack explores a limitation in the way the web application manages the session ID, more specifically the vulnerable web application. When authenticating a user, it doesn't assign a new session ID, making it possible to use an existent session ID.

[The OWASP® Foundation, Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_fixation)

Session fixation is a technique for hijacking a user session.

Consider an attacker visits a public computer, navigates to `example.com` and starts the sign in process, but does not finish signing in. Before leaving the computer, the attacker inspects the session token and takes it with them.

Then, consider a victim sits at the same computer, navigates to `example.com`, and signs in with their own account.If `example.com` failed to reset the session token for the victim, then the attacker can hijack the victim's session and act on their behalf.

## How does Clerk protect against session fixation?

Clerk resets the session token each time a user signs in or out of a browser. When the session is reset, the old session token is invalidated and can no longer be used for authentication.
