The `<ClerkLoaded>` component guarantees that the Clerk object has loaded and will be available under `window.Clerk`. This allows you to wrap child components to access the `Clerk` object without the need to check it exists.

  ## Usage with frameworks

  It's not recommended to wrap the entire app in the `<ClerkLoaded>` component; instead, only wrap the components that need access to the `Clerk` object.

  ## Usage with JavaScript

  The following methods available on an instance of the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk) class is used to render and control the `<ClerkLoaded />` component:

  <Properties>
    - `appearance`
    - <code>[Appearance](/docs/customization/overview) | undefined</code>
