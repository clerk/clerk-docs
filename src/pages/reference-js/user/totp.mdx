## Methods

### `createTOTP()`

```typescript
function createTOTP(): Promise<TOTPResource>;
```

Generates a TOTP secret for a user that can be used to register the application on the user's authenticator app of choice. Note that if this method is called again (while still unverified), it replaces the previously generated secret.

#### Returns

// TODO: Write

### `verifyTOTP()`

```typescript
function verifyTOTP(params: VerifyTOTPParams): Promise<TOTPResource>;
```

Verifies a TOTP secret after a user has created it. The user must provide a code from their authenticator app, that has been generated using the previously created secret. This way correct setup and ownership of the authenticator app can be validated.

#### `VerifyTOTPParams`

// TODO: Write

#### Returns

// TODO: Write

### `disableTOTP()`

```typescript
function disableTOTP(): Promise<DeletedObject>;
```

Disables TOTP by deleting the user's TOTP secret.

#### Returns

// TODO: Write

### `createBackupCode()`

```typescript
function createBackupCode(): Promise<BackupCodeResource>;
```

Generates a fresh new set of backup codes for the user. Note that if this method is called again, it replaces the previously generated codes.

#### Returns

// TODO: Write
