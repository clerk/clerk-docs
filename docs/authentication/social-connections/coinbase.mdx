  - Use Coinbase to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [Coinbase](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/coinbase-app/docs/coinbase-app) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Coinbase account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Coinbase**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your Coinbase account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Coinbase's Developer Platform](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Coinbase as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Coinbase**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create a Coinbase app

  > [!NOTE]
  > Coinbase automatically creates a default project for you named `Project 1`. Select the icon next to the project name to rename.

  1. In your [Coinbase Developer Platform project dashboard](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects), navigate to the **API Keys** tab.
  1. Select **OAuth**, then select **Create client**.
  1. Complete the required fields. In **Redirect URIs**, paste the **Redirect URI** you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Create client**. The page will refresh and you should see the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** in the **OAuth** section. Save both values somewhere secure. Keep this page open.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  1. Navigate back to your Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open. Paste these values into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the Coinbase connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal) page.
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:

  - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
  - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`

  1. Sign in with your Coinbase account.
