</TutorialHero>


<Steps>

### Set up a React application using Vite

Scaffold your new React application using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm create vite@latest clerk-react -- --template react-ts
  cd clerk-react
  npm install
  npm run dev

  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn create vite clerk-react--template react-ts
  cd clerk-react
  yarn install
  yarn dev
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm create vite clerk-react --template react-ts
  cd clerk-react
  pnpm install
  pnpm dev
  ```

</CodeBlockTabs>


### Install `@clerk/clerk-react`

Clerk's React SDK gives you access to prebuilt [components](/docs/components/overview), [hooks](/docs/references/react/use-user), and helpers for React. Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn" ]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/clerk-react
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @clerk/clerk-react
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add @clerk/clerk-react
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment keys

In your React project's root folder, you may have an `.env` file alongside `package.json` and other configuration files. If you don't see it, create it.

Add the following code to your `.env.local` file to set your public and secret keys.

**Pro tip!** If you are signed into your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/), your keys should become visible by clicking on the eye icon.
<InjectKeys>

```sh filename=".env"
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
```

</InjectKeys>

### Wrap your app in `<ClerkProvider />`

The [`<ClerkProvider />`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component provides active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components. Import it into your app by adding `import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react'` at the top of your `/src/main.tsx` file. You will need to import your Publishable Key and provide it to your `<ClerkProvider />` using the `publishableKey` prop. 


```tsx filename="src/main.tsx" {5, 7, 9-11, 15, 17}
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.tsx'
import './index.css'
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Missing Publishable Key")
}

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
      <App />
    </ClerkProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

At this point, your application should use Clerk's [Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview) pages that are available out of box. Start your React application via `npm run dev`, visit `http://localhost:5173`, and sign up to get access to your application. 

### Embed the `<UserButton />` and `<SignInButton />`

Clerk offers a set of [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) to add functionality to your app with minimal effort. The [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button) allows users to manage their account information and log out, completing the full authentication circle. The [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button) is an unstyled component that you can use to either create a basic button or to wrap around your styled button and turn it into a Sign In button.

Lastly you will use the [`<SignedIn />`](/docs/components/control/signed-in) and [`<SignedOut />`](/docs/components/control/signed-out) control components. These will allow you to render the `<UserButton />` only to users who are signed in and `<SignInButton />` only to users who are signed out.

Add the following anywhere inside `<ClerkProvider />` in your app. First add `import { UserButton, SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut } from "@clerk/clerk-react";` to the top of your file. Then add the following somewhere inside of your application -- a header area is a great place. The `afterSignOutUrl` prop lets you customize what page the user will be redirected to after sign out.

```tsx filename="src/App.tsx {1, 7-12}
import { SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from "@clerk/clerk-react"

function App() {

  return (
    <div>
      <SignedOut>
        <SignInButton />
      </SignedOut>
      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/" />
      </SignedIn>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

If you removed the Vite boilerplate from `App.tsx` by copying and pasting the boce, you probably want to also delete `src/App.css` and `src/assets/react.svg`.

</Steps>

## You're authenticated!

Congratulations! Your app is now only available to authenticated users! But this is just the first step. If you would like to clone or investigate this application, please check out:

## Add routing to your Clerk Powered application

React has many options for handling routing and you are free to choose the option that suits you best. If you would like to learn how to integrate React Router's latest Data API based router (nicknamed Data Router) please see the [Add React Router to your Clerk Powered application](/docs/references/react/add-react-router) guide. 


### Next steps

Now that you have an application integrated with Clerk, you will want to read the following documentation:
