  - Use Okta Workforce to enable SSO via SAML for your Clerk app
</TutorialHero>

Enabling SAML with Okta Workforce allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Okta account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for the [Okta dashboard](https://www.okta.com/).

<Steps>
  ## Enable Okta as a SAML connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For specific domains or organizations**.
  1. Under **SAML**, select **Okta Workforce**.
  1. Enter the **Domain**. This is the email domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your application. Optionally, select an **Organization**.
  1. Enter the **Name**. This will be displayed on the sign-in form.
  1. Select **Add connection**. You'll be redirected to the connection's configuration page.
  1. In the **Service Provider Configuration** section, save the **Single sign-on URL** and **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)** values somewhere secure. Keep this page open.

  ## Create a new enterprise application in Okta

  1. Navigate to [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) and sign in.
  1. In the Okta dashboard, select **Admin** in the top right corner.
  1. In the navigation sidenav, select the **Applications** dropdown and select **Applications**.
  1. Select **Create App Integration**.
  1. In the **Create a new app integration** modal, select the **SAML 2.0** option and select the **Next** button.
  1. Once redirected to the **Create SAML Integration** page, complete the **General Settings** fields. An **App name** is required.
  1. Select **Next**. You'll be redirected to the **Configure SAML** page.
  1. Paste the **Single sign-on URL** and the **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)** values that you saved from the Clerk Dashboard into their respective fields.

  ## Map Okta claims to Clerk attributes

  Mapping the claims in your IdP to the attributes in Clerk ensures that the data from your IdP is correctly mapped to the data in Clerk.

  | Clerk attribute | Okta claim |
  | - | - |
  | `mail` | `user.email` |
  | `firstName` | `user.firstName` |
  | `lastName` | `user.lastName` |

  1. In the Okta dashboard, find the **Attribute Statements (optional)** section.
  1. For the **Name** field, enter `mail`.
  1. For the **Value** field, choose `user.email` from the dropdown.
  1. Select the **Add Another** button to add another attribute.
  1. For the **Name** field, enter `firstName`.
  1. For the **Value** field, choose `user.firstName` from the dropdown.
  1. Select the **Add Another** button to add another attribute.
  1. For the **Name** field, enter `lastName`.
  1. For the **Value** field, choose `user.lastName` from the dropdown.
  1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the **Next** button to continue.
  1. You will be redirected to the **Feedback** page. Fill out the feedback however you would like and select the **Finish** button to complete the setup.

  ## Assign selected user or group in Okta

  You need to assign your users/user groups to your enterprise application. For example, if you were part of the Clerk organization, you would have access to users and groups in the Clerk organization. In this case, you could assign one or more users or entire groups to the enterprise application you just created.

  1. In the Okta dashboard, select the **Assignments** tab.
  1. Select the **Assign** dropdown. You can either select **Assign to people** or **Assign to groups**.
  1. In the search field, enter the user or group of users that you want to assign to the enterprise application.
  1. Select the **Assign** button next to the user or group that you want to assign.
  1. Select the **Done** button to complete the assignment.

  ## Configure Okta as your Identity Provider

  Once you have completed the setup in Okta, you will be redirected to the application instances page with the **Sign On** tab selected.

  1. Under **Sign on methods**, copy the **Metadata URL**.
  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard and find the **Identity Provider configuration** section.
  1. Under the **Metadata configuration** option, paste the **Metadata URL**.
  1. Select the **Fetch & save** button to complete the setup.
