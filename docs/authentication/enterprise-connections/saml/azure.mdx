  - Use Microsoft Azure Entra ID to enable SSO via SAML for your Clerk app
</TutorialHero>

Enabling SAML with Microsoft Azure Entra ID (formerly [Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/new-name)) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Microsoft account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

<Steps>
  ## Enable Microsoft Entra ID as a SAML connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For specific domains or organizations**.
  1. Under **SAML**, select **Microsoft Entra ID (Formerly AD)**.
  1. Enter the **Domain**. This is the email domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your application. Optionally, select an **Organization**.
  1. Enter the **Name**. This will be displayed on the sign-in form.
  1. Select **Add connection**. You'll be redirected to the connection's configuration page.
  1. In the **Service Provider Configuration** section, save the **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** and **Identifier (Entity ID)** values somewhere secure. Keep this page open.

  ## Create a new enterprise app in Microsoft

  1. In a separate page, navigate to the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/get-started/azure-portal) and sign in.
  1. Under the **Azure Services** section, find and select **Enterprise applications**. You may have to go to the [**All services**](https://portal.azure.com/#allservices) page and then scroll down to the **Identity** section to find it.
  1. Select **New application**. You'll be redirected to the **Browse Microsoft Entra Gallery** page.
  1. Select **Create your own application**.
  1. In the modal that opens:

  - Enter the **Name** of your app.
  - Select **Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)**.
  - Select **Create**.

  ## Assign selected user or group in Microsoft

  Now that you have created the enterprise app, you need to assign users or groups to the app. For example, if you were part of the Clerk organization, you would have access to users and groups within the Clerk organization. In this case, you could assign individual users or entire groups to the enterprise app you just created.

  1. In the **Getting Started** section, select the **Assign users and groups** link.
  1. Select **Add user/group**. You'll be redirected to the **Add Assignment** page.
  1. Select the **None Selected** link.
  1. To assign a user to the enterprise app, you can either use the search field to find a user or select the checkbox next to the user in the table.
  1. Select **Select** at the bottom of the page. You'll be redirected to the **Add Assignment** page.
  1. Select **Assign** at the bottom of the page.

  ## Configure Clerk as your Service Provider

  After assigning the user or group to the enterprise app, you need to configure the SSO settings in Microsoft to enable SAML SSO.

  1. In the navigation sidenav, open the **Manage** dropdown and select **Single sign-on**.
  1. In the **Select a single sign-on method** section, select **SAML**. You'll be redirected to the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page.
  1. Find the **Basic SAML Configuration** section.
  1. Select **Edit**. The **Basic SAML Configuration** panel will open.
  1. Paste the **Identifier (Entity ID)** and **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** values you saved from the Clerk Dashboard into their respective fields. These values will be saved automatically.
  1. Select **Save** at the top of the panel. Close the panel.

  ## Configure Microsoft as your Identity Provider

  1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, find the **SAML Certificates** section.
  1. Copy the **App Federation Metadata Url**.
  1. Navigate back to the **Clerk Dashboard**. In the **Identity Provider Configuration** section, under **App Federation Metadata Url**, paste the **App Federation Metadata URL**.
  1. Select **Fetch & save**.

  ## Map Microsoft claims to Clerk attributes

  Mapping the claims in your IdP to the attributes in Clerk ensures that the data from your IdP is correctly mapped to the data in Clerk.

  | Clerk attribute | Microsoft claim |
  | - | - |
  | `mail` | `user.userprincipalname` |
  | `firstName` | `user.givenname` |
  | `lastName` | `user.surname` |

  The only Microsoft claim that is necessary to map is the email address claim. This is the email address that your users will use to authenticate into your app.

  1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, find the **Attributes & Claims** section.
  1. Select **Edit**.
  1. To edit the email claim, select the claim with the claim name ending with `/claims/emailaddress`. You'll be redirected to the **Manage claim** page.
  1. Next to **Source attribute**, search for and select `user.userprincipalname` in the dropdown.
  1. Select **Save** at the top of the page.
