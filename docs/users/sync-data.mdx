# Sync data to your backend with webhooks

A common set up for applications involves a frontend and some sort of backend storage system. Since authentication and user management happens on Clerk's side, data eventually needs to reach the application's backend.

The recommended way to sync data between Clerk and your application's backend is via webhooks. In this guide, you'll learn how to enable webhooks and how to set up your backend so that it is updated every time an event happens on your Clerk instance.

Given the asynchronous nature of webhooks, they might not fit in every use case out there but they are a great fit for most applications.

<Steps>

### Enable webhooks

To enable webhooks, go to the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks) page in the Clerk dashboard and click on the **Add Endpoint** button.

![Add endpoint](/docs/images/users/guides/sync-backend/enable-webhook.png)

You'll be presented with a form where you can specify the URL of your backend endpoint. This is the URL where Clerk will send the webhook events. You can also specify the events you want to receive. For example, if you only want to receive events related to users, you can select the **user** option.

![Add endpoint form](/docs/images/users/guides/sync-backend/webhook-form.png)

Once you click the **Create** button, you'll be presented with your webhook endpoint dashboard. Here you can see the URL of your endpoint and the events you selected and you can also test your endpoint.

### Setup your backend endpoint

Now that you have your webhook endpoint set up, you need to set up your backend endpoint to receive the events. The Clerk webhook events are sent as HTTP POST requests with a JSON body. The body of the request contains the event type and the data related to the event.

Here's an example of a webhook payload for a `user.created` event:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "birthday": "",
    "created_at": 1654012591514,
    "email_addresses": [
      {
        "email_address": "james@clerk.com"
      }
    ]
  },
  "object": "event",
  "type": "user.created"
}
```

To learn more about the payload structure, check out the [webhooks reference](/docs/integrations/webhooks).

Now you need to set up your backend endpoint to receive the webhook events. The exact steps depend on the backend framework you're using. Below are some examples for common frameworks.

Svix provides a package for verifying the webhook signature, making it easy to verify the authenticity of the webhook events.

<CodeBlockTabs options={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install svix
  ```

```bash filename="terminal"
yarn add svix
```

```bash filename="terminal"
pnpm add svix
```

</CodeBlockTabs>

Next you will want to retrieve the Webhook signing secret from the Clerk Dashboard. You can find this in the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks) section of the Clerk Dashboard. You will need to set this as an environment variable in your Next.js project.

If you're using Next.js with App Router, you can create a webhook endpoint in the `app/api` directory.

```ts filename="app/api/webhook/route.ts"
import { Webhook } from 'svix'
import { headers } from 'next/headers'
import { WebhookEvent } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export async function POST(req: Request) {

  // You can find this in the Clerk Dashboard -> Webhooks -> choose the webhook
  const WEBHOOK_SECRET = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET

  if (!WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
    throw new Error('Please add WEBHOOK_SECRET from Clerk Dashboard to .env or .env.local')
  }

  // Get the headers
  const headerPayload = headers();
  const svix_id = headerPayload.get("svix-id");
  const svix_timestamp = headerPayload.get("svix-timestamp");
  const svix_signature = headerPayload.get("svix-signature");

  // If there are no headers, error out
  if (!svix_id || !svix_timestamp || !svix_signature) {
    return new Response('Error occured -- no svix headers', {
      status: 400
    })
  }

  // Get the body
  const payload = await req.json()
  const body = JSON.stringify(payload);

  // Create a new SVIX instance with your secret.
  const wh = new Webhook(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

  let evt: WebhookEvent

  // Verify the payload with the headers
  try {
    evt = wh.verify(body, {
      "svix-id": svix_id,
      "svix-timestamp": svix_timestamp,
      "svix-signature": svix_signature,
    }) as WebhookEvent
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error verifying webhook:', err);
    return new Response('Error occured', {
      status: 400
    })
  }

  // Get the ID and type
  const { id } = evt.data;
  const eventType = evt.type;

  console.log(`Webhook with and ID of ${id} and type of ${eventType}`)
  console.log('Webhook body:', body)

  return new Response('', { status: 201 })
}

```

</Tab>

<Tab>

If you're using Next.js with Pages Router, you can create a webhook endpoint in the `pages/api` directory.

```ts filename="pages/api/webhook.ts"
import type { IncomingHttpHeaders } from 'http';
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import type { WebhookRequiredHeaders } from 'svix';
import type { WebhookEvent } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
import { Webhook } from 'svix';

const webhookSecret: string = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET;

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequestWithSvixRequiredHeaders,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  const headers = req.headers;
  // Create a new Webhook instance with your webhook secret
  const wh = new Webhook(webhookSecret);

  let evt: WebhookEvent;
  try {
    // Verify the webhook payload and headers
    evt = wh.verify(payload, headers) as WebhookEvent;
  } catch (_) {
    // If the verification fails, return a 400 error
    return res.status(400).json({});
  }
  const { id } = evt.data;

  const eventType = evt.type;
  if (eventType === 'user.created') {
    console.log(`User ${id} was ${eventType}`);
    res.status(201).json({});
  }
}

type NextApiRequestWithSvixRequiredHeaders = NextApiRequest & {
  headers: IncomingHttpHeaders & WebhookRequiredHeaders;
};
```

The code example assumes a working Express application. Please adjust as needed for your setup and framework of choice.

```ts
import bodyParser from 'body-parser'

app.post('/api/webhook', bodyParser.raw({ type: 'application/json' }), async function(req, res) {

   // Check if the 'Signing Secret' from the Clerk Dashboard was correctly provided
   const WEBHOOK_SECRET = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET
   if (!WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
      throw new Error('You need a WEBHOOK_SECRET in your .env')
   }

   // Grab the headers and body
   const headers = req.headers;
   const payload = req.body

   // Get the SVIX headers for verification
   const svix_id = headers["svix-id"] as string;
   const svix_timestamp = headers["svix-timestamp"] as string;
   const svix_signature = headers["svix-signature"] as string;

   // If there are missing SVIX headers, error out
   if (!svix_id || !svix_timestamp || !svix_signature) {
      return new Response('Error occured -- no svix headers', {
         status: 400
      })
   }

   // Initiate SVIA
   const wh = new Webhook(WEBHOOK_SECRET)

   let evt: WebhookEvent

   // Attempt to verify the incoming webhook
   // If successful, the payload will be available from 'evt'
   // If the verification fails, error out and  return error code
   try {
      evt = wh.verify(payload, {
         "svix-id": svix_id,
         "svix-timestamp": svix_timestamp,
         "svix-signature": svix_signature,
      }) as WebhookEvent
   } catch (err: any) {
      // Console log and return errro
      console.log('Webhook failed to verify. Error:', err.message)
      return res.status(400).json({
         success: false,
         message: err.message
      })
   }

   // Grab the ID and TYPE of the Webhook
   const { id } = evt.data;
   const eventType = evt.type;

   console.log(`Webhook with an ID of ${id} and type of ${eventType}`)
   // Console log the full payload to view
   console.log('Webhook body:', evt.data)

   return res.status(200).json({
      success: true,
      message: 'Webhook received'
   })
})
```

### Adding your endpoint to Middleware

Your Route Handler must be made public or ignored by Middleware to allow the request to succeed. The following example will make any webhooks created under `app/api/webhooks/` public. See [authMiddleware](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware) for more information.

 ```tsx filename="middleware.tsx" {4}
 import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";
 
export default authMiddleware({
    publicRoutes: ["/api/webhooks(.*)"]
    });
 
export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],
};
    ```


### Testing the webhook

To test a webhook locally, you can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet. You can then use the ngrok URL as the webhook URL in the Clerk Dashboard.

If you are testing webhooks outside of your development, you can use our webhook test requests to test your webhook. You can find these in the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks) section of the Clerk Dashboard.
