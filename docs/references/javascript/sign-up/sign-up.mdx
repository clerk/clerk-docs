# `SignUp`

The `SignUp` object holds the state of the current sign-up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the [sign-up flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview#sign-up-flow). Once a sign-up is complete, a new user is created.

There are two important steps that need to be done in order for a sign-up to be completed:

- Supply all the required fields. The required fields depend on your instance settings.
- Verify contact information. Some of the supplied fields need extra verification. These are the email address and phone number.

The above steps can be split into smaller actions (e.g. you don't have to supply all the required fields at once) and can done in any order. This provides great flexibility and supports even the most complicated sign-up flows.

Also, the attributes of the `SignUp` object can basically be grouped into three categories:

- Those that contain information regarding the sign-up flow and what is missing in order for the sign-up to complete. For more information on these, check our [detailed sign-up flow guide.](/docs/custom-flows/overview)
- Those that hold the different values that we supply to the sign-up. Examples of these are `username`, `emailAddress`, `firstName`, etc.
- Those that contain references to the created resources once the sign-up is complete, i.e. `createdSessionId` and `createdUserId`.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `'missing_requirements' \| 'complete' \| 'abandoned' \| null` | The status of the current sign-up.<br/>The following values are supported:<br/><ul><li>`missing_requirements:` There are required fields that are either missing or they are unverified.</li><li>`complete:` All the required fields have been supplied and verified, so the sign-up is complete and a new user and a session have been created.</li><li>`abandoned:` The sign-up has been inactive for a long period of time, thus it's considered as abandoned and need to start over.</li></ul> |
| `requiredFields` | `string[]` | An array of all the required fields that need to be supplied and verified in order for this sign-up to be marked as complete and converted into a user. |
| `optionalFields` | `string[]` | An array of all the fields that can be supplied to the sign-up, but their absence does not prevent the sign-up from being marked as complete. |
| `missingFields` | `string[]` | An array of all the fields whose values are not supplied yet but they are mandatory in order for a sign-up to be marked as complete. |
| `unverifiedFields` | `string[]` | An array of all the fields whose values have been supplied, but they need additional verification in order for them to be accepted. Examples of such fields are `emailAddress` and `phoneNumber`. |
| `verifications` | `SignUpVerifications` | An object that contains information about all the verifications that are in-flight. |
| `username` | `string \| null` | The username supplied to the current sign-up. This attribute is available only if usernames are enabled. Check the available instance settings in your Clerk Dashboard for more information. |
| `emailAddress` | `string \| null` | The email address supplied to the current sign-up. This attribute is available only if the selected contact information includes email address. Check the available instance settings for more information. |
| `phoneNumber` | `string \| null` | The phone number supplied to the current sign-up. This attribute is available only if the selected contact information includes phone number. Check the available instance settings for more information. |
| `web3Wallet` | `string \| null` | The Web3 wallet public address supplied to the current sign-up. In [Ethereum](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/common-terms.html#address-public-key), the address is made up of `0x` + `40 hexadecimal characters`. |
| `hasPassword` | `boolean` | The value of this attribute is true if a password was supplied to the current sign-up. This attribute is available only if password-based authentication is enabled. Check the available instance settings for more information. |
| `firstName` | `string \| null` | The first name supplied to the current sign-up. This attribute is available only if name is enabled in personal information. Check the available for more information. lastName |
| `lastName` | `string \| null` | The last name supplied to the current sign-up. This attribute is available only if name is enabled in personal information. Check the available instance settings for more information. |
| `unsafeMetadata` | `{[string]: any} \| null` | Metadata that can be read and set from the frontend. Once the sign-up is complete, the value of this field will be automatically copied to the newly created user's unsafe metadata. One common use case for this attribute is to use it to implement custom fields that can be collected during sign-up and will automatically be attached to the created User object. |
| `createdSessionId` | `string \| null` | The identifier of the newly-created session. This attribute is populated only when the sign-up is complete. |
| `createdUserId` | `string \| null` | The identifier of the newly-created user. This attribute is populated only when the sign-up is complete. |
| `abandonAt` | `number \| null` | The epoch numerical time when the sign-up was abandoned by the user. |

## Methods

### `create()`

```typescript
function create(params: SignUpCreateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>;
```

This method initiates a new sign-up flow. It creates a new `SignUp` object and de-activates any existing `SignUp` that the client might already had in progress.

The form of the given `params` depends on the configuration of the instance. Choices on the instance settings affect which options are available to use.

The `create` method will return a promise of the new `SignUp` object. This sign-up might be complete if you supply the required fields in one go. However, this is not mandatory. Clerk's sign-up process provides great flexibility and allows users to easily create multi-step sign-up flows.

#### `SignUpCreateParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `firstName` | `string \| null` | The user's first name. This option is available only if name is selected in personal information. Please check the instance settings for more information. |
| `lastName` | `string \| null` | The user's last name. This option is available only if name is selected in personal information. Please check the instance settings for more information. |
| `password` | `string \| null` | The user's password. This option is available only if password-based authentication is selected. Please check the instance settings for more information. |
| `gender` | `string \| null` | The user's gender. This option is available only if gender is selected in personal information. Please check the instance settings for more information. |
| `emailAddress` | `string \| null` | The user's email address. This option is available only if email address is selected in contact information. Keep in mind that the email address requires an extra verification process. Please check the instance settings for more information. |
| `phoneNumber` | `string \| null` | The user's phone number. This option is available only if phone number is selected in contact information. Keep in mind that the phone number requires an extra verification process. Please check the instance settings for more information. |
| `web3Wallet` | `string \| null` | The user's Web3 wallet public address. In [Ethereum](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/common-terms.html#address-public-key), the address is made up of `0x` + `40 hexadecimal characters`. |
| `username` | `string \| null` | The user's username. This option is available only if usernames are enabled. Please check the instance settings for more information. |
| `unsafeMetadata` | `{[string]: any} \| null` | Metadata that can be read and set from the frontend. Once the sign-up is complete, the value of this field will be automatically copied to the newly created user's unsafe metadata. One common use case for this attribute is to use it to implement custom fields that can be collected during sign-up and will automatically be attached to the created `User` object. |
| `strategy` | `'oauth_<provider>' \| 'saml' \| 'ticket'` | The strategy to use for the sign-up flow.<br />The following strategies are supported:<br /><ul><li>`oauth_<provider>`: The user will be authenticated with their Social login account. See available [OAuth Strategies](/docs/references/javascript/types/oauth-strategy).</li><li>`saml`: The user will be authenticated with SAML.</li><li>`ticket`: The user will be authenticated via the ticket *or token* generated from the Backend API.</li></ul> |
| `redirectUrl` | `string` | The redirect URL after the sign-up flow has completed. |
| `actionCompleteRedirectUrl?` | `string` |The URL that the user will be redirected to, after successful authorization from the OAuth provider and Clerk sign in. This parameter is required only if `strategy` is set to an OAuth strategy like `oauth_<provider>`, or set to `saml`. |
| `ticket` | `string` | Provide the ticket *or token* generated from the Backend API. This parameter is required only if `strategy` is set to `ticket`. |
| `transfer` | `boolean` | Transfer the user to a dedicated sign-up for an OAuth flow. |

### `update()`

```typescript
function update(params: SignUpUpdateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>;
```

This method is used to update the current sign-up.

As with `create`, the form of the given `params` depends on the configuration of the instance.

#### `SignUpUpdateParams`

`SignUpUpdateParams` is a mirror of [`SignUpCreateParams`](#sign-up-create-params) with the same fields and types.

### `createEmailLinkFlow()`

```typescript
function createEmailLinkFlow(): {
  startEmailLinkFlow: (params: StartEmailLinkFlowParams) => Promise<SignUp>;
  cancelEmailLinkFlow: () => void;
};
```

Sets up a sign-up with email link flow. Calling `createEmailLinkFlow()` will return two functions.

The first function is async and starts the email link flow, preparing an email link verification. It sends the email link email and starts polling for verification results. The signature is `startEmailLinkFlow({ redirectUrl: string }) => Promise<SignUpResource>`.

The second function can be used to stop polling at any time, allowing for full control of the flow and cleanup. The signature is `cancelEmailLinkFlow() => void`.

#### Returns

`createEmailLinkFlow` returns an object with two functions:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `startEmailLinkFlow` | <code>(params: [StartEmailLinkFlowParams](#start-email-link-flow-params)) => Promise\<SignUp\></code> | Function to start the email link flow. It prepares an email link verification and polls for the verification result. |

#### `StartEmailLinkFlowParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `redirectUrl` | `string` | The email link target URL. Users will be redirected here once they click the email link from their email. |
