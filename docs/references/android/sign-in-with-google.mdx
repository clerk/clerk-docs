This guide will teach you how to add native Sign in with Google to your Clerk apps on Android platforms.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open - one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

<Steps>
  ## Enable Google as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Google**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Authorized Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ## Create the Google Developer Android client

  1. Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  1. Select an existing project or [create a new one](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate). You'll be redirected to your project's **Dashboard** page.
  1. In the top-left, select the menu icon (**â‰¡**) and select **APIs & Services**. Then, select **Credentials**.
  1. Next to **Credentials**, select **Create Credentials**. Then, select **OAuth client ID.** You might need to [configure your OAuth consent screen](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849#userconsent). Otherwise, you'll be redirected to the **Create OAuth client ID** page.
  1. For the **Application type**, select **Android**.
  1. Complete the required fields.
     - **Package name**: Your package name is in your `build.gradle` file, formatted as `com.example.myclerkapp`.
     - **SHA-1 certificate fingerprint**: To get your SHA-1, run the following command in your terminal:

       ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
       $ keytool -keystore path-to-debug-or-production-keystore -list -v
       ```

       > [!NOTE]
       > Replace `path-to-debug-or-production-keystore` with the path to your debug or production keystore. By default, the debug keystore is located in `~/.android/debug.keystore`. It may ask for a keystore password, which is `android`. **Please note that Java is required to run the `keytool` command.**
  1. Select **Create**.

  ## Create the Google Developer Web client

  1. In the same project, create another client. Next to **Credentials**, select **Create Credentials**. Then, select **OAuth client ID.**
  1. For the **Application type**, select **Web Application**.
  1. Complete the required fields. In the **Authorized Redirect URIs** setting, paste the **Authorized Redirect URI** value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Create**. A modal will open with your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save these values somewhere secure.

  ## Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ## Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/test-your-connection" />

  > [!WARNING]
  > Google sign-in [**does not** allow users to sign in via in-app browsers](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/modernizing-oauth-interactions-in-native-apps-for-better-usability-and-security).
</Steps>

## Usage

To learn how to build a sign-up and sign-in flow that supports OAuth connections in your Android application, see the [custom flow guide](/docs/custom-flows/oauth-connections).
