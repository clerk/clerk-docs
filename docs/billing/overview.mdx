Clerk Billing is a feature that allows you to create and manage Plans and Features for your application. This guide will walk you through how to enable Billing, create Plans and Features, and use them to gate access to your application.

## Enable Billing

To enable Billing for your application, navigate to the [**Billing Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/settings) page in the Clerk Dashboard. This page will guide you through enabling Billing for your application. If your application was created after the Billing launch, you will only need to create a plan. If your application predates the Billing launch, you will need to complete the steps outlined.

## Create a plan

Plans are what your users subscribe to. There is no limit to the number of Plans you can create.

There are two types of Plans:

- Organization Plans: plans that only [organizations](/docs/organizations/overview) can subscribe to.
- User Plans: plans that only users can subscribe to.

To create a Plan, navigate to the [**Plans**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/plans) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Here, you can create, edit, and delete Plans. When creating a Plan, you can also create Features for the Plan; see the next section for more information.

> Plans appear in some Clerk components depending on what kind of plan it is. All Plans can appear in the `<PricingTable />` component. If it's a User Plan, it can appear in the `<UserProfile />` component. If it's an Organization Plan, it can appear in the `<OrganizationProfile />` component. When creating or editing a Plan, if you'd like to hide it from appearing in Clerk components, you can toggle the **Visible on Components** option off.

## Add features to a plan

Features make it easy to give entitlements to your Plans. You can add any number of Features to a Plan.

You can add a Feature to a Plan when you are creating a Plan. To add it after a Plan is created:

1. Navigate to the [**Plans**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/plans) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
1. Select the Plan you'd like to add a Feature to.
1. In the **Features** section, select **Add Feature**.

If it's a User Plan, it can appear in the `<UserProfile />` component. If it's an Organization Plan, it can appear in the `<OrganizationProfile />` component. When adding a Feature to a Plan, it will also automatically appear in the corresponding Plan. When creating or editing a Feature, if you'd like to hide it from appearing in Clerk components, you can toggle the **Visible on Components** option off.

## Create a pricing page in your app

You can create a pricing page in your app by using the [`<PricingTable />`](/docs/components/pricing-table) component. This component displays a table of Plans and Features that users can subscribe to. It's recommended to create a dedicated page, as shown in the following example.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/pricing/page.tsx' }}
import { PricingTable } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Page() {
  return <PricingTable />
}
```

## Use features and plans in your app

You can use Clerk's Features and Plans to gate access to the content in your app. There are a few ways to do this, but the recommended and simplest way is either using our [`has()`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#has) method or our [`<Protect />`](/docs/components/protect) component.

When deciding which to use, both offer the same functionality, but `has()` is available for any JS-framework, while `<Protect />` is only available for React-based frameworks.

### Example: Using `has()`

You can use the `has()` method to test if the user has access to a **Plan**:

```jsx
const { has } = await auth()
const hasPremiumAccess = has({ plan: 'gold' })
```

Or a **Feature**:

```jsx
const { has } = await auth()
const hasPremiumAccess = has({ feature: 'widgets' })
```

The [`has()`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#has) method checks if the user has been granted a specific type of access control (Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan) and returns a boolean value. It is available on the [`auth` object](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object) server-side, which is accessed differently depending the framework you are using.

The following example accesses the `auth` object and the `has()` method using the [Next.js-specific `auth()` helper](/docs/references/nextjs/auth).

    The following example demonstrates how to use `has()` to check if a user has a Plan.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default async function Page() {
      // Use `auth()` helper to access the `has()` method
      const { has } = await auth()

      // Use `has()` method to check if user has a Plan
      const hasBronzePlan = has({ plan: 'bronze' })

      if (!hasBronzePlan) return <h1>Only subscribers to the Bronze plan can access this content.</h1>

      return <h1>For Bronze subscribers only</h1>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The following example demonstrates how to use `has()` to check if a user has a Feature.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

    export default async function Page() {
      // Use `auth()` helper to access the `has()` method
      const { has } = await auth()

      // Use `has()` method to check if user has a Feature
      const hasPremiumAccess = has({ feature: 'premium_access' })

      if (!hasPremiumAccess)
        return <h1>Only subscribers with the Premium Access feature can access this content.</h1>

      return <h1>Our Exclusive Content</h1>
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Example: Using `<Protect />`

The [`<Protect />`](/docs/components/protect) component protects content or even entire routes by checking if the user has been granted a specific type of access control (Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan). You can pass it a `fallback` prop that will be rendered if the user does not have the access control.

    The following example demonstrates how to use `<Protect />` to protect a page by checking if the user has a Plan.

    ```tsx
    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          plan="bronze"
          fallback={<p>Only subscribers to the Bronze plan can access this content.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

    The following example demonstrates how to use `<Protect />` to protect a page by checking if the user has a Feature.

    ```tsx
    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          feature="premium_access"
          fallback={<p>Only subscribers with the Premium Access feature can access this content.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
