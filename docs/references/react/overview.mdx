description: Learn how to integrate React into your Clerk application.
---

The Clerk React SDK is a wrapper around the Clerk JavaScript SDK. It is the recommended way to integrate Clerk into your React application.

Clerk React provides React.js implementations of [Clerk components](/docs/components/overview); highly customizable, prebuilt components that you can use to build beautiful user management applications. You can find display components for building [sign-in](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in), [sign-up](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up), [account switching](/docs/components/user/user-button), and [user profile management](/docs/components/user/user-profile) pages as well as flow [control components](/docs/components/control/signed-in) that act as helpers for implementing a seamless authentication experience.

Clerk React provides a suite of [custom hooks](/docs/references/react/use-user). These hooks give you access to the [`Clerk` object](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk), and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up.

## Choosing specialized React SDKs

> [!WARNING]
> For some React-based frameworks Clerk offers specialized SDKs which you should use instead of `@clerk/clerk-react`. For example, if you're using Next.js you **have** to install `@clerk/nextjs` as `@clerk/clerk-react` is incompatible.

For some React-based frameworks Clerk offers specialized SDKs which you should use instead of `@clerk/clerk-react`. These SDKs better integrate into the respective framework and will provide you with a better experience. Here's an overview to their quickstart guides:

- [Next.js quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)
- [React Router quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/react-router)
- [Remix quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/remix)
- [Astro quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/astro)
- [Tanstack Start quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/tanstack-start)

## Setting up Clerk React

You need to create a Clerk application in the Clerk Dashboard before you can set up Clerk React. For more information, see the [setup guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).

Once a Clerk application has been created, you can install and start using Clerk React in your application. [The quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/react) will have all the information you need to get started.
