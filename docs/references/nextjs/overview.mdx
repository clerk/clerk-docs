description: Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Next.js application.

# Overview

Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your Next.js application. This documentation covers the capabilities and methods available from Clerk's Next.js SDK.

## Guides

- [Read session and user data](/docs/references/nextjs/read-session-data)
- [Add custom sign up and sign in pages](/docs/references/nextjs/custom-signup-signin-pages)
- [Integrate Clerk into your app with tRPC](/docs/references/nextjs/trpc)

## Client-side helpers

Because Clerk Next.js is a wrapper around Clerk React, you can utilize the hooks that Clerk React provides. These hooks give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object, and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. You can learn more about these hooks [in the React SDK reference](/docs/references/react/overview).

## App router references

Clerk provides first-class support for the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app). The below methods and references show how to integrate Clerk features into applications that take advantage of the latest App Router and React Server Components features.

- [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth)
- [`currentUser()`](/docs/references/nextjs/current-user)
- [Route Handlers](/docs/references/nextjs/route-handlers)
- [Server Actions](/docs/references/nextjs/server-actions)

## Pages router references

Clerk continues to provide drop-in support for the Next.js Pages Router. In addition to the main Clerk integration, several methods are available for instrumenting authentication within Pages Router-based applications.

- [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth)
- [`buildClerkProps()`](/docs/references/nextjs/build-clerk-props)

## Other references

### `Auth` object

Both `auth()` and `getAuth()` return an `Auth` object. This JavaScript object contains important information like session data, your user's ID, as well as their organization ID. Learn more about the `Auth` object [here](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object).

### `clerkMiddleware()`

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Next.js application through middleware. It allows you to integrate authorization into both the client and server of your application. You can learn more [here](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware).

### Demo repositories

To see an example of Clerk's features, such as user and organization management, integrated in a single application, explore the Clerk + Next.js demo repositories:
