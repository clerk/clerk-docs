description: Notify users of unauthorized sign-ins to their accounts

Clerk identifies attempts by unauthorized individuals or entities to access a user's account.

## Detecting unauthorized sign-ins

When a sign-in attempt is made from an unfamiliar device, Clerk notifies the account owner by email with details about the newly created session. The account owner can immediately revoke the session if it's recognized as unauthorized.

## Email notification for unauthorized access

The email notification users receive for unauthorized sign-ins depends on the instance configuration and the application's billing plan.

By default, the email includes information about the unauthorized sign-in attempt, such as the device type, operating system, IP address, location, and sign-in method. If you've set a support email for your app, Clerk adds instructions for users to contact the app administrator.

For instances with device tracking enabled, the email also includes a button for users to sign out from the unrecognized device. Clicking this button immediately revokes the session.

Customize the unauthorized sign-in email notification:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Emails**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=customization/email) page.
1. Select the **Sign in from new device** option. You'll be redirected to the template settings page.
1. Edit the email template.
1. Select **Apply changes**.

## Revoke sessions for unauthorized sign-ins

> [!WARNING]
> This feature isn't available in production for free plans but can be tested for free in development mode. For more information, see the [pricing](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} page.

For apps that support it, users can immediately revoke unauthorized sign-ins directly from the email notification. A single click will revoke the suspicious session and redirect the user to a confirmation page. The contents of the confirmation page depend on the instance's configuration.

- [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview) enabled: The user is redirected to the [Unauthorized sign-in](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview#unauthorized-sign-in) page, where content can be customized based on the app's theme.
- Account Portal disabled: The user sees a plain text confirmation of the successful session revocation.

In either case, after revoking the session, users must sign in again unless they have an active session on their device.

To customize the URL path of the unauthorized sign-in page:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Paths**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=paths) page.
1. Edit the **Unauthorized sign in page** path.
1. Select **Save**.
