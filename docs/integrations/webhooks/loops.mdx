  - Sync Clerk users to your Loops audience and send automated emails.
</TutorialHero>

[Loops](https://loops.so) is an email platform that helps you send marketing and transactional emails to help increase revenue and engagement or improve your user's experience of your app.

This tutorial demonstrates how to sync your Clerk users to Loops so you can email users with Loop's email marketing tools. You will also learn how to send email sequences to new Clerk users.

<Steps>
  ### Create a Clerk webhook endpoint in Loops

  Loops' [Incoming webhooks](https://loops.so/docs/integrations/incoming-webhooks) feature lets Loops accept webhooks directly from external platforms like Clerk.

  To create a new webhook endpoint in Loops:

  1. Navigate to the **Clerk** settings page in the [Loops dashboard](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=clerk).
  1. Save the **Endpoint URL** somewhere secure; you're going to need it for Clerk's webhook configuration.

  ### Create a webhook in the Clerk Dashboard

  You must create a new Clerk webhook endpoint so that it can send data to Loops. Here is where you will provide the **Endpoint URL** from the last step, and then choose the events you want to listen to.

  1. Navigate to the **Webhooks** page in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks).
  1. Select the **Add Endpoint** button.
  1. In the **Endpoint URL** field, paste the **Endpoint URL** that you saved from Loops.
  1. In the **Message Filtering** section, select the `user.created` and/or `user.updated` events, depending on your desired setup.
  1. Select the **Create** button.
  1. You will be redirected to your endpoint's settings page. Leave this page open.

  ### Add your signing secret in Loops

  To keep communication secure between the two platforms:

  1. On the Clerk endpoint's settings page, copy the **Signing Secret**. It should be on the right side of the page with an eye icon next to it.
  1. Back in the Loops dashboard, add the **Signing Secret**.

  ### Configure Loops events

  The final step is to configure which events Loops should accept from Clerk and what Loops should do with the data.

  In the Loops dashboard, under **Complete Setup**, enable the events you selected in Clerk in step 2. Doing this will sync your Clerk users to Loops when they are created or updated in Clerk.

  For each event, you can optionally choose to trigger a "[loop](https://loops.so/docs/loop-builder)" when new webhooks are sent to Loops, by selecting an event in the **Trigger an event** field. This is useful, for example, if you want to send an email welcome sequence to new Clerk users.

  You can also choose to assign a user group value for each Clerk user, which will help you organize and segment contacts in Loops.
