Retrieves a list of memberships for an organization. Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) object with a `data` property that contains an array of [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-organization-membership) objects, and a `totalCount` property that indicates the total number of organization memberships in the system for the specified organization.

```ts
function getOrganizationMembershipList(
  params: GetOrganizationMembershipListParams,
): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<OrganizationMembership[]>>
```

## `GetOrganizationMembershipListParams`

<Properties>
  - `organizationId`
  - `string`

  The ID of the organization to retrieve the list of memberships from.

  ---

  - `limit?`
  - `number`

  The number of results to return. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than 501. Can be used for paginating the results together with `offset`. Defaults to `10`.

  ---

  - `offset?`
  - `number`

  Skip the first `offset` results when paginating. Needs to be an integer greater or equal to zero. To be used in conjunction with `limit`. Defaults to `0`.

  ---

  - `orderBy?`
  - `'phone_number' | 'email_address' | 'created_at' | 'first_name' | 'last_name' | 'username'`

  Return memberships in a particular order. Prefix with a `-` to reverse the order. Prefix with a `+` to list in ascending order. Defaults to `'-created_at'`.

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/organizations/{organization_id}/memberships`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organization-Memberships#operation/ListOrganizationMemberships){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
