> [!WARNING]
> Using `has()` **on the server-side** to check Permissions works only with **Custom Permissions**, as [System Permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/roles-and-permissions#system-permissions) aren't included in the session token claims. To check System Permissions, verify the user's Role instead.
