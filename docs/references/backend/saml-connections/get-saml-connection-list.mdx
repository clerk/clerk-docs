title: '`getSamlConnectionList()`'
description: Use Clerk's Backend SDK to retrieve the list of SAML connections for an instance.
---

Retrieves the list of SAML connections for an instance. Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) object with a `data` property that contains an array of [`SamlConnection`](/docs/references/backend/types/saml-connection) objects, and a `totalCount` property that indicates the total number of SAML connections for the instance.

```ts
function getSamlConnectionList(params: SamlConnectionListParams = {}): Promise<SamlConnection[]>
```

## `SamlConnectionListParams`

<Properties>
  - `limit?`
  - `number`

  The number of results to return. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than 501. Default: `10`

  ---

  - `offset?`
  - `number`

  The number of results to skip. Default: `0`
</Properties>

## Examples

### Basic

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

```tsx
const response = await clerkClient.samlConnections.getSamlConnectionList()
```

### Limit the number of results

Retrieves organization list that is filtered by the number of results.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.samlConnections.getSamlConnectionList({
  // returns the first 10 results
  limit: 10,
})
```

### Skip results

Retrieves organization list that is filtered by the number of results to skip.

```tsx
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.samlConnections.getSamlConnectionList({
  // skips the first 10 results
  offset: 10,
})
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/saml_connections`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/SAML-Connections#operation/ListSAMLConnections){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
