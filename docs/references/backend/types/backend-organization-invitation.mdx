# The Backend `OrganizationInvitation` object

The Backend `OrganizationInvitation` object is similar to the [`OrganizationInvitation`](/docs/references/javascript/organization-invitation) object as it is the model around an organization invitation. However, the Backend `OrganizationInvitation` object is different in that it is used in the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organization-Invitations#operation/CreateOrganizationInvitation){{ target: '_blank' }} and is not directly accessible from the Frontend API.
