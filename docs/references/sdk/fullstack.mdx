# Fullstack SDK

A fullstack SDK combines the [frontend-only SDK](/docs/references/sdk/frontend-only) and [backend-only SDK](/docs/references/sdk/backend-only) into one. A fullstack SDK is necessary for frameworks that support multiple rendering strategies (SSR, SSG, etc.), middleware, data fetching, and more. Examples of such frameworks would be Next.js or Rails.

## Expected features

- User only needs to provide their [publishable key](/docs/references/sdk/terminology) and [secret key](/docs/references/sdk/terminology)
- User only needs to adjust one or two files to add Clerk to their app (e.g. adding Clerk to the configuration file of that framework)
- User can use [Clerk’s components](/docs/components/overview) in their choice of framework (e.g. in a React-based framework you import these components as React components)
- Give users access to [`Client`](/docs/references/javascript/client){{ target: '_blank' }}, [`Session`](/docs/references/javascript/session){{ target: '_blank' }}, [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user){{ target: '_blank' }}, and [`Organization`](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization){{ target: '_blank' }} properties through the framework’s choice of state management
- User should be able to use ClerkJS options
- Centralized request authentication (e.g. in a middleware or plugin)
- Give access to the instance of Backend API client (so that users can use all methods)
- User should be able to do auth for roles and permissions

## Optional features

- User should be able to enforce auth on individual routes
- Use singleton pattern to only create one instance of Clerk backend client

## Implementation

Please check out the respective [frontend-only SDK](/docs/references/sdk/frontend-only) and [backend-only SDK](/docs/references/sdk/backend-only) implementation instructions.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're looking for a real-world example, have a look at [`@clerk/nextjs`](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/tree/main/packages/nextjs).
