description: Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Vue application using the Clerk Vue SDK.
---

The Vue SDK is built on top of the [Clerk JavaScript SDK](/docs/references/javascript/overview), and is the recommended way to integrate Clerk into your Vue application.

## Custom composables

The Vue SDK provides access to custom composables that provide direct access to the [`Clerk` object](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk), a user's [`User` object](/docs/references/javascript/user/user), and helper methods for authentication flows.

## Framework-specific SDKs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're building a standard Vue application (client-side only), use `@clerk/vue`. If you're using Nuxt, use the dedicated `@clerk/nuxt` package which includes backend integration.

Clerk offers framework-specific SDKs that are customized to provide the better developer experience and integration with each framework's features. Choose the appropriate SDK based on your framework:

| Framework | Package | Docs |
| - | - | - |
| Nuxt | `@clerk/nuxt` | [Nuxt SDK](/docs/references/nuxt/overview) |

## Set up Clerk Vue

Before you can add Clerk to your Vue application, you must create a Clerk app in the Clerk Dashboard. To get started, follow the [setup guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk). Then, follow the [quickstart guide](/docs/quickstarts/vue) to set up the Vue SDK in your app.
