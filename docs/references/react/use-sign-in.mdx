title: '`useSignIn()`'
description: Access and manage the current user's sign-in state in your React application with Clerk's useSignIn() hook.
---

The `useSignIn()` hook provides access to the [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-in attempt and manage the sign-in flow. You can use this to create a [custom sign-in flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview#sign-in-flow).

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `isLoaded`
  - `boolean`

    A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads.

  ---

  - `setActive()`
  - <code>(params: [SetActiveParams](#set-active-params)) => Promise\<void></code>

  A function that sets the active session.

  ---

  - `signIn`
  - [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in)

  An object that contains the current sign-in attempt status and methods to create a new sign-in attempt.
</Properties>

### `SetActiveParams`

<Properties>
  - `session`
  - <code>[Session](/docs/references/javascript/session) | string | null</code>

  The session resource or session ID (string version) to be set as active. If `null`, the current session is deleted.

  ---

  - `organization`
  - <code>[Organization](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) | string | null</code>

  The organization resource or organization ID/slug (string version) to be set as active in the current session. If `null`, the currently active organization is removed as active.

  ---

  - `beforeEmit?`
  - `(session?: Session | null) => void | Promise<any>`

  Callback run just before the active session and/or organization is set to the passed object. Can be used to hook up for pre-navigation actions.
</Properties>

## How to use the `useSignIn()` hook

### Check the current state of a sign-in

The following example uses the `useSignIn()` hook to access the [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object, which contains the current sign-in attempt status and methods to create a new sign-in attempt. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state.

```tsx {{ filename: 'src/pages/SignInPage.tsx' }}
import { useSignIn } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

export default function SignInPage() {
  const { isLoaded, signIn } = useSignIn()

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null
  }

  return <div>The current sign-in attempt status is {signIn?.status}.</div>
}
```

### `SignIn` status values

The `status` property of the `SignIn` object can be one of the following values:

<Properties>
  - `complete`
  - `string`

  The user has been signed in and the custom flow can proceed to `setActive()` to create a session.

  ---

  - `needs_first_factor`
  - `string`

  One of the following [first factor verification strategies](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/first-factor) is missing: `email_link`, `email_code`, `phone_code`, `web3_metamask_signature`, `web3_coinbase_wallet_signature` or `oauth_provider`.

  ---

  - `needs_second_factor`
  - `string`

  One of the following [second factor verification strategies](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/second-factor) is missing: `phone_code` or `totp`.

  ---

  - `needs_identifier`
  - `string`

  The user's [identifier](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#identifiers) (e.g., email address, phone number, username) is missing.

  ---

  - `needs_new_password`
  - `string`

  The user needs to set a new password.
</Properties>

### Create a custom sign-in flow with `useSignIn()`

The `useSignIn()` hook can also be used to build fully custom sign-in flows, if Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow. Different sign-in flows include email and password, email and phone codes, email links, and multifactor (MFA). To learn more about using the `useSignIn()` hook to create custom flows, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).
