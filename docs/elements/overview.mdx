# Clerk Elements (Beta)

<Callout type="warning">
Clerk Elements is currently in beta and **not yet recommended for production use**.

If you have any feedback, please reach out to [beta-elements@clerk.dev](mailto:beta-elements@clerk.dev) or head over to the [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/orgs/clerk/discussions/3315).

Clerk Elements is a library of unstyled, composable components that can be used to build custom UIs on top of Clerk's APIs without having to manage the underlying logic.

## Why use Clerk Elements?

You should use Clerk Elements if you want a deeper level of control and customization of the styles and layout of your UI while using Clerk's APIs. For example, if [the appearance prop](/docs/components/customization/overview) does not meet your needs, Clerk Elements might be for you. That said, you can also use Clerk Elements alongside the prebuilt components.

- **Component-first** - Make it as easy to build custom UIs with Clerk as it is with Clerk's drop-in prebuilt components. Clerk Elements handles the underlying business logic for you and provides a curated library of components without sacrificing on best practices or features.
- **Unstyled, with a little bit of magic** - Use the web platform and best-in-class components for building great authentication flows. Baked-in to the components are little bits of magic, like the fully accessible segmented one-time-passcode (OTP) input, and instant password validation during sign up.

### Integrate Clerk Elements into your workflow

Clerk Elements can be integrated into your existing appliction and workflows. For example, you may want to use Clerk Elements with:

- **Tailwind CSS** – If you use Tailwind CSS, you can pass a `className` prop to most elements that Clerk Elements renders. See [the styling guide](/docs/elements/guides/styling#tailwind-css) to learn more.
- **Existing styles or component library** – If you have an existing component library that you want to use to build your authentication UIs, Clerk Elements supports composition via an `asChild` prop. Read [the styling guide](/docs/elements/guides/styling#with-existing-components-via-as-child) to learn more.
- **With Clerk's prebuilt components** - Continue using Clerk's prebuilt components while customizing the flows you care most about.

## Getting started

Clerk Elements currently only works with Next.js and [Clerk Core 2](https://clerk.com/changelog/2024-04-19). As it gets closer to a stable release, support for additional frameworks will be added. If your Next.js application is already using Clerk, make sure to [upgrade to Core 2](/docs/upgrade-guides/core-2/nextjs). If you're starting from scratch, follow the [Next.js quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs) before proceeding.

To get started, install the Clerk Elements package:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```sh filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/elements
  ```

  ```sh filename="terminal"
  yarn add @clerk/elements
  ```

  ```sh filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @clerk/elements
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

Once you have your project set up, you can start building custom UIs with Clerk Elements using Clerk's guides and examples. For example, to use Clerk Elements to build a custom sign-in flow, you can explore:

- [Build a sign-in flow](/docs/elements/guides/sign-in)
- [Sign-in examples](/docs/elements/examples/sign-in)
- [Sign-in components](/docs/elements/reference/sign-in)

<Callout type="info">
With the beta release, only sign-up and sign-in flows are supported. Support for building the rest of Clerk's prebuilt components with Elements is actively being worked on.
