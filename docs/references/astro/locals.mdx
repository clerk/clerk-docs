Through Astro [`locals`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/#storing-data-in-contextlocals), Clerk's [`Auth`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object) and current [`User`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-user){{ target: '_blank' }} objects can be accessed between middlewares and pages. These locals are injected when you configure the provided [middleware](/docs/references/astro/clerk-middleware).

## `locals.auth()`

`Astro.locals.auth()` returns an `Auth` object. This JavaScript object contains important information like session data, your user's ID, as well as their active organization ID. Learn more about the `Auth` object [here](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }}.

### Example: Protect a page or form

You can use the `auth()` local to protect your pages and forms. It will return the current user's ID if they are signed in, or `null` if they are not.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["Protect a page", "Protect a form"]}>
  ```astro {{ filename: 'src/pages/protected.astro' }}
  ---
  const { userId, redirectToSignIn } = Astro.locals.auth()

  if (!userId) {
    return redirectToSignIn()
  }
  ---

  <div>Protected page</div>
  ```

  ```astro {{ filename: 'src/pages/form.astro' }}
  ---
  if (Astro.request.method === 'POST') {
    if (!Astro.locals.auth().userId) {
      throw new Error('You must be signed in to add an item to your cart')
    }

    const data = await Astro.request.formData()
    console.log('add item action', data)
  }
  ---

  <form method="POST">
    <input value="test" type="text" name="name" />
    <button type="submit">Add to Cart</button>
  </form>
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## `locals.currentUser()`

Current user data is important for data enrichment. The `currentUser()` local fetch the current user's [Backend `User`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-user){{ target: '_blank' }} object, which includes all of the user's information and provides a set of methods to manage their account.

Under the hood, this local:

- uses the `GET /v1/users/me` endpoint.
- counts towards the [Backend API Request Rate Limit](/docs/backend-requests/resources/rate-limits).

For more information on `currentUser()`, see the [reference](/docs/references/nextjs/current-user){{ target: '_blank' }}.

```astro {{ filename: 'src/pages/form.astro' }}
---
if (Astro.request.method === 'POST') {
  const user = await Astro.locals.currentUser()

  if (!user) {
    throw new Error('You must be signed in to use this feature')
  }

  const data = await Astro.request.formData()
  const serverData = {
    usersHobby: data.get('hobby'),
    userId: user.id,
    profileImage: user.imageUrl,
  }

  console.log('add item action completed with user details ', serverData)
}

<form method="POST">
  <input value="soccer" type="text" name="hobby" />
  <button type="submit">Submit your hobby</button>
</form>
```
