In the Clerk Dashboard, all workspaces are organizations:

- **Personal workspace**: When you sign up for Clerk, an organization labeled "Personal workspace" is automatically created for you. This allows you to invite team members and collaborate immediately.
- **Additional organization workspaces**: You can create additional organizations to manage different projects, teams, or clients. The organization workspace that a user is currently viewing is called the [active organization](/docs/organizations/overview#active-organization).

This guide will walk you through how to use the Clerk Dashboard to create additional organization workspaces, invite collaborators, and transfer your apps between workspaces.

## Create additional organization workspaces

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select **Create organization**. A modal will open.
1. Complete the form. Organization slugs are unique across all instances, so common naming conventions might already be in use by another instance.
1. Select **Create organization**. The newly created organization will be set the active organization.

## Invite collaborators to your organization workspace

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select **Manage**. A modal will open showing the organization's information.
1. In the left nav, select **Members**.
1. Select **Invite**.
1. In the **Invite new members** form, enter the email of the user you want to invite and select the role to assign.
1. Select **Send invitations**.

## Transfer ownership of an application

Transferring an application between two organizations, does not cause disruptions. Your API keys, settings, domains, and other configurations remain unchanged, and your app will continue to function as expected. Only the ownership is updated, so no further action is needed to maintain continuity for existing users.

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), open the workspace dropdown and select the workspace that contains the application you want to transfer.
1. Locate and select the application to transfer.
1. At the top of the Clerk Dashboard, select **Configure**.
1. In the navigation sidenav, under the **Application** heading, select [**Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=settings).
1. Select **Transfer ownership**. A modal will open.
1. Complete the form and select **Transfer ownership**. The page will redirect to the **Applications** page and show the transferred application.

### Transfer to an org without billing information

**An application with an existing paid subscription can only be transferred to an organization with active billing information**. You can set up billing information on the receiving organization without being charged.

To set up a payment method without being charged:

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select the workspace that you want to transfer the application to.
1. Select the workspace dropdown again, and select **Manage**.
1. In the sidenav, select **Billing**, then select **Upgrade to unlimited members**.
1. Add your billing information. **You will not be charged immediately**. Doing this just ensures billing information is added to the organization.
1. Once that billing information is added, you will be able to transfer your Clerk app to the receiving organization.
