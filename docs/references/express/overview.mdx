description: Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Express application using the Clerk Express SDK.
---

The Clerk Express SDK is the recommended method for integrating Clerk into your Express application. Refer to the [quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/express) to get started.

## Methods

### `clerkMiddleware()`

The `clerkMiddleware()` function checks the request's cookies and headers for a session JWT and if found, attaches the [`Auth`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#auth-object) object to the request object under the `auth` key.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

const app = express()

// Pass no parameters
app.use(clerkMiddleware())

// Pass options
app.use(clerkMiddleware(options))
```

### `clerkMiddleware()` Options

The `clerkMiddleware()` function accepts [these options](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#clerk-middleware-options) in addition to the following:

<Properties>
  - `clerkClient`
  - [`ClerkClient`](/docs/references/backend/overview#create-clerk-client-options)

  An instance of the ClerkClient class. This is used to interact with the Clerk API.

  ---

  - `debug`
  - `boolean`

  A flag to enable debug mode. When enabled, the middleware will log debug information to the console.

  ---

  - `enableHandshake`
  - `boolean`

  Enables Clerk's handshake flow, which helps verify the session state when a session JWT has expired. It issues a 307 redirect to refresh the session JWT if the user is still logged in. Defaults to `true`.
</Properties>

### `requireAuth()`

The `requireAuth()` middleware works similarly to `clerkMiddleware()` but adds an extra layer of protection by redirecting unauthenticated users to the sign-in page. By default, the middleware checks for the `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` environment variable and uses it as the sign-in URL. If the variable is not set, you must provide a sign-in URL as an option when configuring the middleware.

#### Example: Use `requireAuth()` to protect a route

The following example uses `requireAuth()` to protect the route based on _authentication_ status, and then uses `getAuth()` to protect the route based on _authorization_ status.

```js
import { requireAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()

// Apply middleware to all routes
app.use(requireAuth())

// Apply middleware to a specific route
// Requires `process.env.CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` to be present
app.get('/protected', requireAuth(), (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route.')
})

// Use a custom sign-in URL instead of the environment variable
app.get('/protected', requireAuth({ signInUrl: '/sign-in' }), (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route.')
})
```

This middleware accepts the same [options](/docs/references/express/overview#options) as `clerkMiddleware()`.

### `getAuth()`

The `getAuth()` function retrieves the current user's authentication state from the request object. See the [Next.js reference documentation](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) to learn more about how to use the returned `auth` object.

#### Example: Use `getAuth()` to protect a route

The following example uses `requireAuth()` to protect the route based on _authentication_ status, and then uses `getAuth()` to protect the route based on _authorization_ status.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware, getAuth, requireAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const port = 3000

// Apply Clerk middleware to all routes
app.use(clerkMiddleware())

// Protect the route from unauthenticated users
const hasPermission = (req, res, next) => {
  const auth = getAuth(req)

  // Return a 403 Forbidden response if the user doesn't have the required permission
  if (!auth.has({ permission: 'org:admin:example' })) {
    return res.status(403).send('Forbidden')
  }

  return next()
}

app.get('/path', requireAuth(), hasPermission, (req, res) => res.json(req.auth))

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```

### `clerkClient`

[Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) provides access to Backend API resources and low-level authentication utilities for JavaScript environments. For example, to retrieve a list of all users in your application, you can use the `users.getUserList()` method from the JavaScript Backend SDK instead of manually making a fetch request to the `https://api.clerk.com/v1/users` endpoint.

All resource operations are mounted as sub-APIs on the `clerkClient` object. See the [reference documentation](/docs/references/backend/overview#usage) for more information.

#### Example: Use `clerkClient` to get a user's information

The following example uses `clerkClient` to get information about the currently signed-in user. First, it retrieves the `userId` from the `Auth` object on the request. Then, it passes that `userId` to `clerkClient.users.getUser()` to fetch the user's information. Finally, it returns the user's information as a JSON response.

```js
import { clerkClient, requireAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  // Get the `userId` from the `Auth` object
  const userId = req.auth.userId

  if (!userId) {
    return void res.status(400).json({ error: 'Error: No signed-in user' })
  }

  // Use the userId to get information about the user
  const user = await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId)
  return void res.status(200).json(user)
})

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```
