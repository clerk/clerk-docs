An **opaque token** is a type of access token that is not human-readable and cannot be easily inspected or decoded. It is used to authenticate requests to a protected resource. Opaque tokens are normally verified with a network call to the issuer rather than a digital signature verification, and can be revoked immediately -- both properties that are different from JWTs.
