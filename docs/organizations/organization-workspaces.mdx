description: Use the Clerk Dashboard to create and invite collaborators to an organization workspace, and to transfer your apps between workspaces.

In the Clerk Dashboard, there are two types of workspaces:

- **Personal account**: A personal account/workspace is a user's unique, individual space, independent of any organization.
- **Organization workspace**: An organization workspace is owned and managed by an organization, which can have multiple members, also known as collaborators. The organization workspace that a user is currently viewing is called the [active organization](/docs/organizations/overview#active-organization).

This guide will walk you through how to use the Clerk Dashboard to create an organization workspace, invite collaborators, and transfer your apps between workspaces.

1. In the top left navigation, select the workspace (such as **Personal account**) and select **Create organization**. A modal will appear.
1. Create an organization by providing a name and an optional organization logo. organization slugs are unique across instances, so common organization naming conventions may already be in use for another instance.
1. When finished, select **Create organization**. Clerk will set the newly created organization as the active organization.
