  - Use Hugging Face to authenticate users with OAuth.
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) allows your users to sign in and sign up to your Clerk application with their Hugging Face account.

## Configure for your development instance

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for _development instances_ — no other configuration is needed.

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Hugging Face**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

In _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials, which includes generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your Hugging Face account. This tutorial will walk you through that process in just a few steps.

<Steps>
  ### Create a Hugging Face Connected App

  1. Navigate to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and sign in to your account.
  1. in the top right corner, select your avatar and select **Settings**.
  1. In the sidebar, select **Connected Apps**.
  1. Under **Developer Applications**, select **Create App**.
  1. Fill out the form as follows:
     - **Application Name**: Name the application whatever you'd like.
     - **Homepage URL**: Enter the homepage URL of your application.
     - **Logo URL**: Enter the URL of the logo for your application.
     - **Token Expiration**: Set the duration for which the token will be valid.
     - **Scopes**: Select the scopes that your application requires. Ensure that **openid**, **profile**, and **email** are included.
     - **Redirect URLs**: You will need to add the **Authorized redirect URI** from Clerk. See the next step.

  ### Get your Redirect URI from Clerk

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
  1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
  1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Hugging Face**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on. Then, copy the **Authorized redirect URI**.
  1. Navigate back to Hugging Face and paste the **Authorized redirect URI** into the **Redirect URLs** field.
  1. Select **Create application**.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in Clerk

  1. Once you have created your Hugging Face Connected App, copy the **Client ID** and **App Secret**.
  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. In the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** field, paste the values you copied from Hugging Face.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk application's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk applications out-of-the-box.

  1. In the navigation sidebar of the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal).
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:
     - For development – [https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in](https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in)
     - For production – [https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in](https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in)
  1. On the sign-in page, you should see **Hugging Face** as an option. Use it to sign in with your Hugging Face account.
