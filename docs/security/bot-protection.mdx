# Bot protection

To protect your sign-ups from bots, Clerk leverages data from our CDN to determine whether a user attempting to sign up might be a bot or not.

## Enable bot sign-up protection

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/attack-protection).
1. Go to **User & Authentication > Attack Protection** in the sidebar menu.
1. In the **Bot sign-up protection** section, enable the feature and choose the **CAPTCHA type** you want to use:
   - **Smart**: The CAPTCHA widget will only be shown if the client is suspected to be a bot. Users suspected of being a bot will be shown a interactive challenge (like clicking a checkbox), in an attempt to verify they are human.
   - **Invisible**: Bot traffic will be automatically blocked. No CAPTCHA widget will be displayed. Users suspected of being a bot will not be allowed to sign up, and are shown an error message instructing them to reach out to your configured support email address.

## Limitations

- Clerk's Expo SDK does not support **Bot sign-up protection** yet.
- If you're building a custom sign-up flow using Clerk's API, instead of using Clerk components, and you have enabled **Bot sign-up protection**, then you need to ensure you have added a DOM node to render the CAPTCHA widget. Refer to the [Add bot protection to your custom sign-up flow](/docs/custom-flows/bot-sign-up-protection) guide for more information.
