# Networkless token verification

Clerk's JWT session token can be verified in a networkless manner using the JWT verification key. By default, Clerk will use our JWKs endpoint to fetch and cache the key for any subsequent verification. If you use the `CLERK_JWT_KEY` environment variable to supply the key, Clerk will pick it up and do networkless verification for session tokens using it.

To learn more about Clerk's token verification, you can find more information on our guide to [validating session tokens](/docs/backend-requests/handling/manual-jwt).

The value of the JWT verification key can also be added at the instance level or for any single middleware call.

Custom instance initialization:

```js
import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/express';

const clerk = createClerkClient({ jwtKey: 'my_clerk_public_key' });
```

## Validate the authorized party of a session token

Clerk's JWT session token contains the `azp` claim, which equals the Origin of the request during token generation. You can provide the middleware with a list of allowlisted origins to verify against, to protect your application from subdomain cookie leaking attacks. You can find an example below:

```js
// Express app
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express';

const authorizedParties = ['http://localhost:3000', 'https://example.com'];

app.use(clerkMiddleware({ authorizedParties }));
```
