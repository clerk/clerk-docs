</Properties>

### `SetActiveParams`

<Properties>
  - `session`
  - <code>[Session](/docs/references/javascript/session) | string | null</code>

  The session resource or session ID (string version) to be set as active. If `null`, the current session is deleted.

  ---

  - `organization`
  - <code>[Organization](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) | string | null</code>

  The organization resource or organization ID/slug (string version) to be set as active in the current session. If `null`, the currently active organization is removed as active.

</Properties>

## How to use the `useSessionList()` hook

### Get a list of sessions

The following example uses `useSessionList()` to get a list of sessions that have been registered on the client device. The `sessions` property is used to show the number of times the user has visited the page.

```tsx {{ filename: 'src/Home.tsx' }}
import { useSessionList } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

export default function Home() {
  const { isLoaded, sessions } = useSessionList()

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Welcome back. You've been here {sessions.length} times before.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```
