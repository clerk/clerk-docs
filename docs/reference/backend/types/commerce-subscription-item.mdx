description: The Backend `CommerceSubscriptionItem` object holds information about a subscription item of your application.

<Include src="_partials/billing/billing-experimental" />

The `CommerceSubscriptionItem` object is similar to the [`BillingSubscriptionItemResource`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/billing-subscription-item-resource) object as it holds information about a subscription item, as well as methods for managing it. However, the `CommerceSubscriptionItem` object is different in that it is used in the [Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/model/commercesubscriptionitem){{ target: '_blank' }} and is not directly accessible from the Frontend API.
