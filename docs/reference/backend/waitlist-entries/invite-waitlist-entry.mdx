Invites a waitlist entry by ID. Returns a [`WaitlistEntry`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-waitlist-entry) representing the invited entry.

```ts

```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `id`
  - `string`

  The ID of the waitlist entry to invite.

  ---

  - `params`
  - [`WaitlistEntryInviteParams`](#waitlist-entry-invite-params)

  An object representing additional parameters for the invitation.
</Properties>

## `WaitlistEntryInviteParams`

<Properties>
  - `ignoreExisting?`
  - `boolean`

  Whether an invitation should be created if there is already an existing invitation for this email address, or has been claimed by another user. Defaults to `false`.
</Properties>

## Example

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

```tsx
const waitlistId = 'waitlist_123'

const response = await clerkClient.waitlistEntries.invite(waitlistId)
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `POST/waitlist_entries/{waitlist_entry_id}/invite`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/waitlist_entries/post/waitlist_entries/\{waitlist_entry_id}/invite){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
