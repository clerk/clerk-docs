How to set up social connection with Discord

## Overview

Adding social connection with Discord to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your Discord account.

> [!NOTE]
> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Discord account and a Discord OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Discord account. To create one, [click here](https://discord.com/register).

## Configuring Discord social connection

First, you need to register a new OAuth Discord app at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

![Creating an OAuth Discord app](/docs/images/authentication-providers/discord/79076b03d80901a41644b8956ec42b4620d9a6c4-1920x838.png)

Set a name for your new application and click create. Now that your application has been created, from the left side panel click on **OAuth2**, this is where you also need to add your **Redirect URL.**

In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)** and enable Discord. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Paste the value into the **Redirect** input and save the changes.

Once all the above are complete, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret.** Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with Discord is now configured for your instance.
