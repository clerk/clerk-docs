title: Cognito password migrator
description: Seamlessly migrate AWS Cognito user passwords into Clerk.
---

## Overview

It is a known limitation that AWS Cognito does not include hashed passwords when listing user pool users.
This necessitates a password reset flow when migrating users to another platform.

To eliminate the need for a cumbersome password reset flow, Clerk provides a password migrator that enables your end users
to sign in to Clerk using their existing Cognito passwords.

In its barest form, it is simply two fields that you set on a Clerk `user` object, through
the [backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/CreateUser).

- `password_hasher`: `awscognito`
- `password_digest`: `awscognito#<COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID>#<COGNITO_CLIENT_ID>#<identifier>`

## Pre-flight checks

<Steps>
  ### Enable the feature

  Get in touch with Clerk to have your `instance_id`s feature-flagged in. You can reach out to us on [Discord][discord], [X/Twitter][x/twitter], or through our [support form][support].

  ### Create a public client

  In AWS, you will need to ensure that your Cognito user pool has a **public** client with the `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` auth flow enabled.

  > [!CAUTION]
  > This step is critical for the migration to work as intended. You can create a new user pool client at any time from the AWS console or through the [AWS CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cognito-idp/create-user-pool-client.html)
</Steps>

## One-time upload

For any Cognito user object that you’d wish to migrate, you will need to have an equivalent Clerk user object,
with the `password_hasher` and `password_digest` fields set.

Below is one method of conducting a batch upload of your Cognito users into Clerk.
However, you are not limited to this approach, nor does it impact the migration flow.

Run the following to create a new script directory and project.

```shell {{ title: '~/' }}
user@~: $ mkdir cognito_to_clerk
user@~: $ cd cognito_to_clerk
user@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ node -v
# Ensure >= 20.0.0

user@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ npm init -y
user@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ npm i @aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity-provider
user@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ npm i @clerk/clerk-sdk-node

user@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ touch .env
# Reference the sample .env below

user@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ touch main.ts
# Feel free to use the snippet below
```

Fill in the `.env` file with your AWS and Clerk credentials.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Always double check that the `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` points to the desired Clerk instance (development vs. production)
> - The `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` should be the public client ID that you created earlier in the [Pre-flight checks](#pre-flight-checks) section.

```shell {{ title: '~/cognito_to_clerk/.env' }}
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=

COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=

CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
```

The provided script below lists your Cognito user pool users, calls
`CreateUser` for each user, and sets the `password_hasher` and `password_digest` fields.

> [!CAUTION]
> As usual, rate limits apply to the `CreateUser` endpoint. [^1]

[^1]: CreateUser has a rate limit rule of 20 requests per 10 seconds. [https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/CreateUser](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Users#operation/CreateUser)

const idpClient = new IDP.CognitoIdentityProviderClient({
  region: AWS_REGION,

async function main() {
  const usersResponse = await idpClient.send(
    new IDP.ListUsersCommand({ UserPoolId: COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID }),
  )
  if (!usersResponse.Users) {
    throw new Error('No users found')
  }

  usersLoop: for (const cognitoUser of usersResponse.Users) {
    // Skip unconfirmed users or EXTERNAL_PROVIDER users (like Facebook, Google, etc)
    if (cognitoUser.UserStatus !== 'CONFIRMED') {
      console.log(
        'Skipping user: User is not confirmed:',
        cognitoUser.Username,
        cognitoUser.UserStatus,
      )
      continue
    }

    // This identifier must match the one that use used for sign in on the Cognito user pool.
    // Note that in AWS, this option is only configurable at the time of user creation.
    let identifier: string
    // Comment/Uncomment the block(s) below to use the identifier from the Cognito user pool.
    {
      identifier = cognitoUser.Attributes?.find((a) => a.Name === 'sub')!.Value!
    }
    {
      identifier = cognitoUser.Attributes?.find((a) => a.Name === 'email')!.Value!
    }
    {
      identifier = cognitoUser.Username!
    }

    if (!identifier) {
      console.log('Skipping user: No identifier found:', cognitoUser)
      continue
    }

    const email = cognitoUser.Attributes?.find((a) => a.Name === 'email')!.Value!

    try {
      await clerk.users.createUser({
        emailAddress: [email],
        passwordDigest: `awscognito#${COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID}#${COGNITO_CLIENT_ID}#${identifier}`,
        // @ts-expect-error - awscognito works, but is not a valid TypeScript yet
        passwordHasher: 'awscognito',
      })
      console.log('Created clerk user for:', identifier)
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 200))
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err)
      break usersLoop
    }
  }
}

main()
```

Run the batch upload script.

```shell {{ title: '~/cognito_to_clerk' }}
user@~/cognito_to_clerk: $ npx tsx --env-file=.env main.ts
```

## Post-upload

Once you have users with the special hasher and digest in your Clerk instance,
you will be able to validate the migration behavior.

<Steps>
  ### Validate

  We recommend validating the integration by taking a single user whose
  Cognito password you know, such as your own, uploading it to Clerk with
  the special `awscognito` hasher and custom digest, and then attempting to sign in
  via your Clerk instance’s managed Account Portal.

  If the password is correct, sign in should work seamlessly.

  > [!TIP]
  > If at any point you need to _reset_, you can delete the user via the Clerk dashboard, and restart the process.
  >
  > This validation may be performed on both your `development` and `production` instances.

  ### Rollout changes

  Up until this point, you were possibly using the Cognito hosted UI for your application’s user sign-in.
  With the [one-time upload](#one-time-upload) out of the way and integration validated, you should be ready to
  update your application to use Clerk’s managed [Account Portal](https://clerk.com/docs/account-portal/overview)
  or the [`<SignIn />`](https://clerk.com/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component.

  Your end users will now be able to sign in to Clerk using their existing passwords without any password reset required.
</Steps>

As users successfully sign in to Clerk, their passwords will be re-hashed, and stored securely. No plaintext passwords are ever stored.
