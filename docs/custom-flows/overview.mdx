# Custom flows

A _custom flow_ refers to a user flow created entirely from scratch using the Clerk API. If Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API.

## How authentication flows work in Clerk

Before building custom authentication flows, read the following sections to get a general understanding of how authentication flows work in Clerk.

### Sign-up flow

The [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) object is the pivotal concept in the sign-up process. It is used to gather the user's information, verify their email address or phone number, add OAuth accounts, and finally, convert them into a [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user).

Every `SignUp` has a set of requirements it must meet before it is turned into a `User`. These requirements are defined by the instance settings you selected in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For example, on the [Email, Phone, Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) page, configuring passwords or email links or even both as the [authentication strategies](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#authentication-strategies).

Once all requirements are met, the `SignUp` will turn into a new `User`, and an active session for that `User` will be created on the current [`Client`](/docs/references/javascript/client).

Don't worry about collecting all the required fields at once and passing them to a single request. The API is designed to accommodate progressive multi-step sign-up forms.

The following steps outline the sign-up process:

1. Initiate the sign-up process by collecting the user's authentication information and passing the appropriate parameters to the [`create()`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in#create) method.
1. Prepare the verification.
1. Attempt to complete the verification.
1. If the verification is successful, set the newly created session as the active session by passing the `SignIn.createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object.

#### The state of a `SignUp`

The `SignUp` object will show **the state of the current sign-up** in the `status` property.

If you need further help on where things are and what you need to do next, you can also consult the `required_fields`, `optional_fields`, and `missingFields` properties.

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| `requiredFields` | All fields that must be collected before the `SignUp` converts into a `User`. |
| `optionalFields` | All fields that can be collected, but are not necessary to convert the `SignUp` into a `User`. |
| `missingFields` | A subset of `requiredFields`. It contains all fields that still need to be collected before a `SignUp` can be converted into a `User`. Note that this property will be updated dynamically. As you add more fields to the `SignUp`, they will be removed. Once this property is empty, your `SignUp` will automatically convert into a `User`. |

#### Verified fields

Some properties of the `SignUp`, such as `emailAddress` and `phoneNumber`, must be **verified** before they are **fully** added to the `SignUp` object.

The `SignUp` object will show **the state of verification** in the following properties:

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| `unverifiedFields` | A list of all [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user) attributes that need to be verified and are pending verification. This is a list that gets updated dynamically. When verification for all required fields has been successfully completed, this value will become an empty array. |
| `verifications` | An object that describes the current state of verification for the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in). There are currently three different keys: `email_address`, `phone_number`, and `external_account`. |

### Sign-in flow

The [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object is the pivotal concept in the sign-in process.

Sign-ins are initiated by creating a `SignIn` object on the current `Client`. If the sign-in is successfully authenticated, it will transform into an active session for that [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user) on the current `Client`.

The following steps outline the sign-in process:

1. Initiate the sign-in process by collecting the user's authentication information and passing the appropriate parameters to the [`create()`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in#create) method.
1. Prepare the [first factor verification](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in#first-factor). Users must complete a first factor verification to prove their identity. This can be something like providing a password, an email link, a one-time code (OTP), a web3 wallet public address, or providing proof of their identity through an external social account (SSO/OAuth).
1. Attempt to complete the first factor verification.
1. Optionally, if you have enabled [multi-factor](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options) for your application, you will need to prepare the [second factor verification](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in#second-factor) for users who have set up 2FA for their account.
1. Attempt to complete the second factor verification.
1. If verification is successful, set the newly created session as the active session by passing the `SignIn.createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object.
