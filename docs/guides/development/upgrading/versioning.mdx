title: Versioning overview
description: A brief guide on how versioning works in Clerk.
---

When backwards incompatible changes are necessary for an API, new versions are released to prevent disruption to existing applications. These versions are identified by their release date, such as 2021-02-05. Both the frontend and backend APIs follow the same version.

## What constitutes a breaking change

A breaking change is any modification that would require users to alter their existing setups. These include:

- **Change in property type**: Altering the data type of a property in either requests or responses.
- **Removal of a property**: Deleting a property or parameter from a request or response.
- **Change in property name**: Renaming a property in request or response payloads.
- **Backwards incompatible endpoint changes**: Implementing changes in an endpoint's functionality that older client versions cannot support. For instance, adding a new status to the sign-in process.
- **Endpoint removal**: Discontinuing access to an existing endpoint, which remains accessible in earlier versions.

## When using an SDK

Each Clerk SDK version corresponds to a specific API version, so by updating the SDK, you're also updating to the latest compatible API version.

### Choosing an API version

When making direct API calls to an endpoint, there are two options to specify the version:

1. **Query parameter**: Set the `__clerk_api_version` query parameter in your request URL.
1. **Clerk-API-Version header**: Include a `Clerk-API-Version` header in your requests.

> [!NOTE]
> You must choose only one method to specify a version. Using both the query parameter and the header simultaneously will lead to an invalid request.
> The same is also true when the version is invalid.

## Available versions

The following is a list of all the available API versions with their respective breaking changes.

### 2025-04-10

Adds support for [version 2 of Clerk session tokens](/docs/guides/how-clerk-works/session-tokens).
The following SDKs are compatible with this version:

| Next.js | @clerk/nextjs v6.15.0 or higher |
| Astro | @clerk/astro v2.6.4 or higher |
| Expo | @clerk/expo v2.9.12 or higher |

### 2024-10-01

- Notification for new sign-ins to users' accounts feature becomes available.
- The response for sign-ins with an email address that matches a **SAML connection** is updated:
  - Instead of responding with a status of `needs_identifier`, the API now returns a status of `needs_first_factor`.
  - The email address that matched will be returned in the identifier field.
  - The only strategy that will be included in supported first factors is `enterprise_sso`.

### 2021-02-05

The initial API version was released on 2021-02-05 as part of the first Clerk release. It predates the versioning system. All changes made to it since then are backwards compatible.

## Long term support policy

This section explains the support plans for major versions of Clerk's SDKs. When a new major version of an official Clerk SDK is released, the previous version is placed into long term support (LTS) mode for a period of **one year**. During this period, new features and bugfixes will not be actively backported, however, any critical patches will be actively backported.

After the LTS period ends, there will be no further changes to the code for that version in any form, and we will strongly recommend upgrading to a new version for product and security improvements. While we strongly recommend upgrading to keep your application secure, all previous versions of SDKs will continue to function indefinitely even if not upgraded.

### Schedule

> [!NOTE]
> Future time ranges are listed when a specific target date is not yet determined. The version "Core `N`" refers to [how Clerk SDKs are versioned and released](/docs/guides/development/upgrading/sdk-versioning).

| Version | Status | As Of | Until |
| - | - | - | - |
| Core 2 | Active | April 19, 2024 | TBD |
| Core 1 | Unsupported | - | - |
| Legacy (v3) | Unsupported | - | - |

### Library compatibility

Clerk's SDKs run in the browser, in Node.js (+ other compatible runtimes), or in both. Below you can find out which Node.js and browser versions Clerk's SDKs support.

| Version | Node.js | Browsers |
| - | - | - |
| Core 2 | `>=18.17.0` | Browsers released in the last two years |
| Core 1 | `>=14.0.0` | Chrome 114, Edge 115, Firefox 116, Safari 12.1 |

### Terminology

- **Critical Patch** - A critical patch addresses an issue that prevents an SDK from delivering intended user value under typical conditions. Other items, such as minor bug fixes and new features are not considered "critical patches".

- **Active** - Receives priority attention from the core maintainers of Clerk. New features to Clerk are only available in the Active version.

- **Long term support** - Receives critical patches, but does not receive new features.

- **Unsupported** - This version of Clerk no longer receives official support of any kind.

- **Evergreen browser** - Includes these browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge (Chromium), Safari, Opera. **No** support for Internet Explorer (IE).
