These are all methods on the [`PhoneNumber`](/docs/references/javascript/phone-number/phone-number) class that allow you to verify a user's phone number.

## `prepareVerification()`

function prepareVerification(): Promise<PhoneNumber>;
```

## `attemptVerification()`

function attemptVerification(params: AttemptPhoneNumberVerificationParams): Promise<PhoneNumber>;
```
