These steps apply to both Clerk UI components and custom auth flows.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need your own domain for production.

<Steps>
  ## Start with the general Deploy to production guide

  Start with [Deploy to production](/docs/guides/development/deployment/production).
  After going through the general production steps, there are a few additional steps for Android.

  ## Confirm your Android app is registered in production

  Make sure your Android app exists in the production instance under [**Native Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/native-applications).
  You will need your **Package Name** and **SHA-256 certificate fingerprint**.

  ## Confirm allowlisted redirect URLs

  Verify that your production instance has the correct [allowlisted redirect URLs](/docs/guides/development/customize-redirect-urls) for your Android app.
  By default, Clerk uses `{packageName}://callback` as the redirect URL.

  ## Test on a physical device

  Build a signed release APK or use Play Store internal testing with production keys and verify behavior.
