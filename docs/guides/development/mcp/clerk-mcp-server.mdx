title: Clerk MCP server
description: Connect AI coding assistants to Clerk's MCP server to get SDK snippets and patterns.
---

Clerk provides a remote [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that allows AI coding assistants like Claude, Cursor, and VS Code Copilot to access Clerk SDK snippets and implementation patterns. This helps AI assistants provide accurate, up-to-date code examples when building authentication features with Clerk.

The Clerk MCP server provides:

- **SDK snippets**: Ready-to-use code patterns for common Clerk features
- **Implementation guides**: Best practices for authentication flows, organizations, and more
- **Framework-specific examples**: Patterns optimized for Next.js, React, and other supported frameworks

## Setup instructions

Clerk's MCP server follows the [authenticated remote MCP spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization), so the server is centrally hosted and managed. The server supports both Server-Sent Events (SSE) and Streamable HTTP transports. Both transports use OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client registration for authentication.

- **HTTP**: `https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp`
- **SSE**: `https://mcp.clerk.com/sse`

We recommend using the Streamable HTTP endpoint where supported for increased reliability.

### Cursor

To add the MCP server to Cursor, you can install by clicking [here](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Clerk&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5jbGVyay5jb20vbWNwIn0=), or searching for Clerk from Cursor's [MCP tools page](https://cursor.directory).

Alternatively, you can manually configure it:

1. Navigate to **Cursor Settings**. To find this, open the **Command Palette** (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`) and search for **Cursor Settings**, or select the gear icon in the top right corner of the app.
1. In the sidenav, select **Tools & Integrations**.
1. Click the **New MCP Server** button to open the MCP configuration JSON file.
1. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clerk": {
      "url": "https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

5. Select the **Needs login** option when it loads. You'll be redirected to authorize Cursor to access the Clerk MCP server.
6. Once authorized, you should see a green active status.

1. Scroll to **Cascade -> MCP Servers**.
1. Select **Add Server -> Add custom server**.
1. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clerk": {

### Codex

**Configuration via CLI:**

Run the following command in Terminal:

```bash
codex mcp add clerk --transport http https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp
```

This will automatically prompt you to log in and connect it to your Codex.

> [!NOTE]
> If this is the first time you are using an MCP in Codex, you will need to enable the `rmcp` feature. Add the following into your `~/.codex/config.toml`:
>
> ```toml
> [beta]
> rmcp = true
> ```

**Configuration through environment variables:**

1. Open the `~/.codex/config.toml` file in your preferred editor.
1. Add the following:

```toml
[mcp_servers.clerk]
type = "url"
url = "https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp"
```

Run `codex mcp login clerk` to complete the authentication flow.

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Why am I seeing an internal server error when trying to connect?">
  This typically occurs when there's a network issue or the authentication flow wasn't completed. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the MCP server, ensuring you complete the OAuth flow when prompted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does the MCP server support Streamable HTTP?">
  Yes, at the `https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp` endpoint. We recommend using this endpoint for increased reliability.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I'm using WSL on Windows, and seeing an error">
  Try connecting using this configuration instead:

  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "clerk": {
        "command": "wsl",
        "args": ["npx", "-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.clerk.com/sse", "--transport", "sse-only"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use this with my own Clerk application?">
  The Clerk MCP server provides SDK snippets and patterns that work with any Clerk application. It does not access your specific Clerk instance data - it provides general implementation guidance and code examples.
