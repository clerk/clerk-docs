The Clerk Express SDK provides a powerful set of tools and utilities to seamlessly integrate authentication, user management, and organization management into your Express application. Refer to the [quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/express) to get started.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are upgrading from the Node SDK, see the [upgrade guide](/docs/upgrade-guides/node-to-express) for more information.

## `clerkMiddleware()`

The `clerkMiddleware()` function checks the request's cookies and headers for a session JWT and if found, attaches the [`Auth`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object) object to the `request` object under the `auth` key.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/express'

const app = express()

// Pass no parameters
app.use(clerkMiddleware())

// Pass options
app.use(clerkMiddleware(options))
```

### `clerkMiddleware()` options

<Include src="_partials/clerk-middleware-options" />

<Properties>
  - `clerkClient`
  - [`ClerkClient`](/docs/references/backend/overview#create-clerk-client-options)

  An instance of the `ClerkClient` class. This is used to interact with the Clerk API.

  ---

  - `debug`
  - `boolean`

  A flag to enable debug mode. When set to `true`, the middleware will log debug information to the console. Defaults to `false`.

  ---

  - `enableHandshake`
  - `boolean`

  A flag to enable Clerk's handshake flow, which helps verify the session state when a session JWT has expired. It issues a `307` redirect to refresh the session JWT if the user is still logged in. Defaults to `true`.
</Properties>

## `requireAuth()`

The `requireAuth()` middleware functions similarly to `clerkMiddleware()`, but also protects your routes by redirecting unauthenticated users to the homepage. It accepts the same [options](/docs/references/express/overview#clerk-middleware-options) as `clerkMiddleware()`.

You can also specify a custom sign-in URL to redirect unauthenticated users to by setting the `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` environment variable or by passing a `signInUrl` option to the middleware. It's recommended to set the environment variable.

```js
import { requireAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const PORT = 3000

// Apply middleware to all routes
app.use(requireAuth())

// Apply middleware to a specific route
// Redirects to the homepage if the user is not authenticated
app.get('/protected', requireAuth(), (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route.')
})

// Redirects to a custom URL if the user is not authenticated
// Requires `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` to be set in env vars
app.get('/protected', requireAuth({ signInUrl: process.env.CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL }), (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route.')
})

// Redirects to a custom URL if the user is not authenticated
// Uses the `signInUrl` option instead of the environment variable
app.get('/protected', requireAuth({ signInUrl: '/sign-in' }), (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is a protected route.')
})

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`)
})
```

## `getAuth()`

The `getAuth()` helper retrieves authentication state from the `request` object. See the [Next.js reference documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) for more examples on how to use the returned `auth` object.

## `getAuth()` options

<Properties>
  - `acceptsToken?`
  - `TokenType`

  The type of authentication token(s) to accept. Valid values are:

  - `'session_token'`
  - `'oauth_token'`
  - `'machine_token'`
  - `'api_key'`

  Can be set to:

  - A single token type.
  - An array of token types.
  - `'any'` to accept all available token types.

  Defaults to `'session_token'`.
</Properties>

### Example: Protecting a route with `requireAuth()` and role-based authorization using `getAuth()`

The following example uses `requireAuth()` to protect the route based on _authentication_ status, and then uses `getAuth()` to protect the route based on _authorization_ status.

```js
import { clerkMiddleware, getAuth, requireAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const PORT = 3000

// Apply `clerkMiddleware()` to all routes
app.use(clerkMiddleware())

// Use `getAuth()` to protect a route based on authorization status
const hasPermission = (req, res, next) => {
  const auth = getAuth(req)

  // Handle if the user is not authorized
  if (!auth.has({ permission: 'org:admin:example' })) {
    return res.status(403).send('Forbidden')
  }

  return next()
}

// Use `requireAuth()` to protect this route
// If user is not authenticated, requireAuth() will redirect back to the homepage
app.get('/path', requireAuth(), hasPermission, (req, res) => res.json(req.auth))

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`)
})
```

### Example: Protecting a route by accepting and verifying multiple token types using `getAuth()`

The following example uses `getAuth()` to protect the route based on token type:

- It accepts any token type `(acceptsToken: 'any')` from the request.
- If the token is a `session_token`, it logs that the request is from a user session.
- Otherwise, it logs that the request uses a machine token and specifies its type.

```js
import express from 'express'
import { getAuth } from '@clerk/express'

const app = express()

app.get('/path', (req, res) => {
  // Use `getAuth()` to protect a route based on token type
  const authObject = getAuth(req, { acceptsToken: 'any' })

  if (authObject.tokenType === 'session_token') {
    console.log('this is session token from a user')
  } else {
    console.log('this is some other type of machine token')
    console.log('more specifically, a ' + authObject.tokenType)
  }
})
```

## `clerkClient`

[Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) provides access to Backend API resources and low-level authentication utilities for JavaScript environments. For example, to retrieve a list of all users in your application, you can use the `users.getUserList()` method from the JavaScript Backend SDK instead of manually making a fetch request to the `https://api.clerk.com/v1/users` endpoint.

All resource operations are mounted as sub-APIs on the `clerkClient` object. See the [reference documentation](/docs/references/backend/overview#usage){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.

### Example: Use `clerkClient` to get a user's information

The following example uses `clerkClient` to get information about the currently signed-in user. If the user is authenticated, their `userId` is passed to [`clerkClient.users.getUser()`](/docs/references/backend/user/get-user){{ target: '_blank' }} to get the current user's [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user){{ target: '_blank' }} object. If not authenticated, the request is rejected with a `401` status code.

```js
import { clerkClient, requireAuth } from '@clerk/express'
import express from 'express'

const app = express()
const PORT = 3000

app.get('/user', async (req, res) => {
  // Get the `userId` from the `Auth` object
  const userId = req.auth.userId

  // If user isn't authenticated, return a 401 error
  if (!userId) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'User not authenticated' })
  }

  // Use `clerkClient` to access Clerk's Backend SDK methods
  // and get the user's User object
  const user = await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId)

  res.json(user)
})

// Start the server and listen on the specified port
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`)
})
```
