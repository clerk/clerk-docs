Organization metadata lets you store custom information about an organization that is not part of the standard fields, such as custom attributes that are specific to your application. This is useful for advanced user segmentation, analytics, or storing application-specific data like subscription tier, department, or region.

There are two types of metadata: **public** and **private**.

- Both **public** and **private** metadata are set and can be accessed from the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }}.
- Only **public** metadata can be accessed from the [Frontend API](/docs/reference/frontend-api/){{ target: '_blank' }}.

Both the `Organization` and `Organization Membership` objects have the metadata fields: `publicMetadata` and `privateMetadata`.

- Use the `publicMetadata` property if you need to set some metadata from your backend and have them displayed as read-only on the frontend.
- Use the `privateMetadata` property if the custom attributes contain sensitive information that should not be displayed on the frontend.

## Set organization metadata

You can set organization metadata in the Clerk dashboard or using the [JS Backend SDK](/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart).

### Clerk Dashboard

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Organizations**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations) page.
1. Select the organization you want to update.
1. In the **Organization metadata** section, select **Edit** next to the metadata you want to update.

### JS Backend SDK

To ease the flow of setting metadata, Clerk provides the [`updateOrganizationMetadata()`](/docs/reference/backend/organization/update-organization-metadata) and [`updateOrganizationMembershipMetadata()`](/docs/reference/backend/organization/update-organization-membership-metadata) methods from the [JS Backend](/docs/js-backend/getting-started/quickstart), which is a wrapper around the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }}.

## Next steps

Now that you understand organization metadata, you can:

- [Use organization slugs in URLs](/docs/guides/organizations/org-slugs-in-urls) for tenant-specific routing
- [Add metadata to invitations](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/invitations#invitation-metadata) to track invitation sources or assign attributes
- [Create and manage organizations](/docs/guides/organizations/create-and-manage) to see metadata in action
- [Check roles and permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/check-access) to control access based on metadata values
