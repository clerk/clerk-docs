## How to use the `useSession()` composable

### Access the `Session` object

The following example uses `useSession()` to access the `Session` object, which has the `lastActiveAt` property. The `lastActiveAt` property is a `Date` object used to show the time the session was last active.

```vue {{ filename: 'SessionStatus.vue' }}
<script setup>
import { useSession } from '@clerk/vue'

const { isLoaded, session, isSignedIn } = useSession()
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">
    <!-- Handle loading state -->
  </div>

  <div v-else-if="!isSignedIn">
    <!-- Handle signed out state -->
  </div>

  <div v-else>
    <p>This session has been active since {{ session.lastActiveAt.toLocaleString() }}</p>
  </div>
</template>
```
