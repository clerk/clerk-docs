> Metadata is limited to **8KB** maximum. If you're storing metadata as a custom claim in the session token, it's highly recommended to keep it under **1.2KB**. [Learn more about the session token size limitations](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens#size-limitations).

> If you use Clerk metadata and modify it server-side, the changes won't appear in the session token until the next refresh. To avoid race conditions, either [force a JWT refresh](/docs/guides/force-token-refresh) after metadata changes or handle the delay in your application logic.
