title: Build your own sign-up page for your Remix app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add a custom sign-up page to your Remix app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

By default, the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/references/remix/custom-sign-in-or-up-page) component handles signing-in or signing-up, but if you'd like to have a dedicated sign-up page, this guide shows you how to use the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component with the [Next.js optional catch-all route](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/route#optional-segments) in order to build custom sign-up page for your Remix app.

If the prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-up.$.tsx' }}
  import { SignUp } from '@clerk/remix'

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignUp />
  }
  ```

  ## Configure your sign-up page

  <Tabs items={["SSR Mode", "SPA Mode"]}>
    <Tab>
      - Set the `CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` environment variable to tell Clerk where the `<SignUp />` component is being hosted.
      - Set `CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users visit the `/sign-up` route directly.
      - Set `CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users select the 'Already have an account? Sign in' link at the bottom of the component.

      Learn more about these environment variables and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/custom-redirects).

      ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
      CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
      CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
      CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      For SPA Mode, add paths to your `ClerkApp` options to control the behavior of the components when you sign in or sign up and when you click on the respective links at the bottom of each component.

      ```ts {{ filename: 'app/root.tsx', mark: [4, 6] }}
      export default ClerkApp(App, {
        publishableKey: PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
        signInUrl: '/sign-in',
        signUpUrl: '/sign-up',
        signInFallbackRedirectUrl: '/',
        signUpFallbackRedirectUrl: '/',
      })
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ## Visit your new page

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    bun dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/sign-up).
