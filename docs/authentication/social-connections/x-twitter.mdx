## Overview

Clerk does not currently support preconfigured shared OAuth credentials for X/Twitter on development instances. This means you will have to provide custom credentials for both development _and_ production instances, which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your X/Twitter Developer account. This tutorial will walk you through that process in just a few simple steps.

> [!WARNING]
> X/Twitter v2 is currently not providing email addresses of users. The user will have to fill in their email address manually when they return to your application after authenticating with X/Twitter.

<Steps>
  ### Create an X/Twitter application

  If you don't have an existing X/Twitter application you've set up for social connection, you need to register a new one at the [X/Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). Note that the process requires approval from X/Twitter before your new application can be used.

  To create a new X/Twitter application:

  1. Navigate to the X/Twitter Developer Portal and go to [**Projects & Apps**](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps).
  1. Select **+ Add App**. After entering a name, you will be presented with your app's credentials. However, for setting up the X/Twitter v2 social connection with Clerk, **you won't need these credentials**. This is because you will be utilizing the OAuth 2.0 flow, which relies on different authentication details.

  ### Enable X/Twitter as a social connection

  To enable X/Twitter as a social connection for your Clerk application:

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
  1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
  1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **X/Twitter**.
  1. Toggle on **Use custom credentials** and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Set the Authorized Redirect URI in your X/Twitter application

  1. Navigate back to the X/Twitter Developer portal.
  1. On the application settings screen, scroll down to the **User authentication settings** section and select **Set up**. You'll be presented with the **User authentication settings** page.
  1. Under **App permissions**, you can choose the permissions you want to request from the user. For this tutorial, select the **Read** permission.
  1. Under **Type of App**, select **Web App, Automated App or Bot**.
  1. Under **App info**, in the **Callback URI / Redirect URL** input, paste the **Authorized Redirect URI** value you copied from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Fill any other required fields, such as the **Website URL**, and select **Save**.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  After setting up your X/Twitter application, you should be able to copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

  Go back to the Clerk Dashboard, where the modal should still be open, and paste these values into the respective fields.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections). In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**. Next to **X/Twitter**, select the settings cog icon. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk application's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk applications out-of-the-box.

  1. In the navigation sidebar of the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal).
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:
     - For development – [https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in](https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in)
     - For production – [https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in](https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in)
  1. On the sign-in page, you should see **X/Twitter** as an option. Use it to sign in with your X/Twitter account.
