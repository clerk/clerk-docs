description: Learn how to delete users in your Clerk application.
---

There are two ways to delete users in Clerk: [in the Clerk Dashboard](#in-the-clerk-dashboard) or [using the Backend API](#using-the-backend-api).

## In the Clerk Dashboard

To delete users in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. At the top of the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Users**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=users).
1. You can either select the user and then in the side navigation menu, select **Delete user**, or select the menu icon on the right side of the user's row and select **Delete user**.

## Using the Backend API

You can delete users in your app using Clerk's Backend API.

Use the following tabs to see examples of how to delete users using one of the following:

- Frontend SDKs, such as Next.js, React, or Remix
- Express
- cURL

<Tabs items={["Fullstack SDKs", "Express", "cURL"]}>

    The following example shows how to delete a user using the JavaScript Backend SDK's [`deleteUser()`](/docs/references/backend/user/delete-user) method from the `users` sub-api of the `clerkClient` instance.

    ```ts {{ filename: 'route.ts' }}
    export async function DELETE() {
      const userId = 'user_123'

      try {
        await clerkClient.users.deleteUser(userId)
        return Response.json({ message: 'User deleted' })
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(error)
        return Response.json({ error: 'Error deleting user' })
      }
    }
    ```

    <If sdk="nextjs">
      If you're using Next.js, you must `await` the instantiation of the `clerkClient` instance, like so:

      ```ts
      const client = await clerkClient()

      const response = await client.users.deleteUser(userId)
      ```
    </If>
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```ts {{ filename: 'delete-user.ts' }}
    import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/express'

    app.post('/deleteUser', async (req, res) => {
      const userId = req.body.userId

      try {
        await clerkClient.users.deleteUser(userId)
        res.status(200).json({ message: 'User deleted' })
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(error)
        res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error deleting user' })
      }
    })
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    curl 'https://api.clerk.com/v1/users/{user_id}' -X DELETE -H 'Authorization:Bearer {{secret}}' -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
    ```
  </Tab>
