title: Testing with Playwright
description: Use Playwright to write end-to-end tests with Clerk.
---

[Playwright](https://playwright.dev) is an open-source, end-to-end testing framework that automates web application testing across multiple browsers. This guide will help you set up your environment for creating authenticated tests with Clerk, assuming you have some familiarity with both Clerk and Playwright.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check out the [demo repo](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-playwright-nextjs) that demonstrates testing a Clerk-powered application using [Testing Tokens](/docs/testing/overview#testing-tokens). To run the tests, you'll need dev instance Clerk API keys, a test user with username and password, and have username and password authentication enabled in the Clerk Dashboard.

<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/testing`

  Clerk's testing package provides integration helpers for popular testing frameworks. Install it by running the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
    ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm i @clerk/testing --save-dev
    ```

    ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add -D @clerk/testing
    ```

    ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/testing -D
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your API keys

  In your test runner, set your publishable and secret key as the `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variables, respectively.

  To find your keys:

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
  1. In the top navbar, select **Configure**. In the sidebar, select **API Keys**.
  1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.

  > [!WARNING]
  > Ensure that the secret key is provided securely to prevent exposure to third parties. For example, if you are using GitHub Actions, refer to [_Using secrets in GitHub Actions_](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

  ### Configure Playwright with Clerk

  The `clerkSetup()` function obtains a Testing Token when your test suite starts, making it available for all subsequent tests to use. This ensures that you don't have to manually generate a Testing Token for each test.

  To configure Playwright with Clerk, call the `clerkSetup()` function in your [global setup file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-global-setup-teardown), as shown in the following example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'global.setup.ts' }}
  import { clerkSetup } from '@clerk/testing/playwright'
  import { test as setup } from '@playwright/test'

  setup('global setup', async ({}) => {
    await clerkSetup()
  })
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can manually set the Testing Token by using the `CLERK_TESTING_TOKEN` environment variable instead of calling `clerkSetup()`.

  ### Use `setupClerkTestingToken()`

  Now that Playwright is configured with Clerk, you can use the `setupClerkTestingToken()` function to include the Testing Token in individual test cases. This function injects the Testing Token for the specific test, ensuring the test can bypass Clerk's bot detection mechanisms. See the following example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'my-test.spec.ts' }}
  import { setupClerkTestingToken } from '@clerk/testing/playwright'
  import { test } from '@playwright/test'

  test('sign up', async ({ page }) => {
    await setupClerkTestingToken({ page })

    await page.goto('/sign-up')
    // Add additional test logic here
  })
  ```
</Steps>
