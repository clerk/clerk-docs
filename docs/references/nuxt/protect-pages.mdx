description: Learn how to protect the pages in your Clerk + Nuxt application.

There are two ways to protect pages in your Nuxt application:

- [Use the `useAuth()` composable](#use-use-auth)
- [Use `createRouteMatcher()`](#use-create-route-matcher)

> [!NOTE]
> To learn how to protect API routes, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/references/nuxt/clerk-middleware#protect-api-routes).

## Use `useAuth()`

<Include src="_partials/vue-nuxt/use-auth" />

## Use `createRouteMatcher()`

The `createRouteMatcher()` is a Clerk helper function that allows you to protect multiple routes in your Nuxt application. It accepts an array of route patterns and checks if the route the user is trying to visit matches one of the patterns passed to it.

The `createRouteMatcher()` helper returns a function that, when called with the `to` route object from Nuxt's [`defineNuxtRouteMiddleware()`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/define-nuxt-route-middleware), will return `true` if the user is trying to access a route that matches one of the patterns provided.

### Configure route middleware

In your `middleware/` directory, create a file named `auth.global.ts` with the following code. This middleware:

- Uses the `userId` returned by the [`useAuth()`](/docs/references/vue/use-auth){{ target: '_blank' }} composable to check if the user is signed in
- Uses the `createRouteMatcher()` helper to check if the user is trying to access a protected route.

If they aren't signed in and are trying to access a protected route, they are redirected to the sign-in page.

```ts {{ filename: 'middleware/auth.global.ts' }}
const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)', '/forum(.*)'])

export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to) => {
  const { userId } = useAuth()

  // If the user is not signed in, they aren't allowed to access
  // the protected route and are redirected to the sign-in page
  if (!userId.value && isProtectedRoute(to)) {
    return navigateTo('/sign-in')
  }
})
```
