This tutorial will demonstrate how to create a new React app using Vite and add authentication to it using Clerk. If you would like to create an application using the React Router framework, see the [React Router quickstart](/docs/react-router/getting-started/quickstart).

<Steps>
  ## Create a React app using Vite

  Run the following commands to create a new React app using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project):

  ```npm
  npm create vite@latest clerk-react -- --template react-ts
  cd clerk-react
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  ## Install `@clerk/clerk-react`

  The [Clerk React SDK](/docs/reference/react/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  ```npm
  npm install @clerk/clerk-react
  ```

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add your Clerk Publishable Key to your `.env` file. It can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable Key.
    1. Paste your key into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  ```

  ## Import the Clerk Publishable Key

  In your `main.tsx` file, import your Clerk Publishable Key. You can add an `if` statement to check that it is imported and that it exists. This will prevent running the app without the Publishable Key, and will also prevent TypeScript errors.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [[6, 7], [9, 11]] }}
  import { StrictMode } from 'react'
  import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
  import './index.css'
  import App from './App.tsx'

  // Import your Publishable Key
  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
    throw new Error('Add your Clerk Publishable Key to the .env file')
  }

  createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <StrictMode>
      <App />
    </StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

  ## Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your app

  <Include src="_partials/clerk-provider/explanation" />

  Pass your Publishable Key as a prop to the component.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [5, 16, 18] }}
  import { StrictMode } from 'react'
  import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
  import './index.css'
  import App from './App.tsx'
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

  // Import your Publishable Key
  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
    throw new Error('Add your Clerk Publishable Key to the .env file')
  }

  createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <StrictMode>
      <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
        <App />
      </ClerkProvider>
    </StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

  ## Create a header with Clerk components

  You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with the [prebuilt control components](/docs/reference/components/overview#control-components). The following example creates a header using the following components:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/reference/components/user/user-button): Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/reference/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page. In this example, since no props or [environment variables](/docs/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables) are set for the sign-in URL, this component links to the [Account Portal sign-in page](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/account-portal#sign-in).

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/App.tsx', mark: [1, [5, 12]] }}
  import { SignedIn, SignedOut, SignInButton, UserButton } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

  export default function App() {
    return (
      <header>
        <SignedOut>
          <SignInButton />
        </SignedOut>
        <SignedIn>
          <UserButton />
        </SignedIn>
      </header>
    )
  }
  ```

  ## Create your first user

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit your app's homepage at [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173). Sign up to create your first user.
