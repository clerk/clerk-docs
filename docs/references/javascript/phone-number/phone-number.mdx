# `PhoneNumber`

The `PhoneNumber` object describes a phone number. Phone numbers can be used as a proof of identification for users, or simply as a means of contacting users.

Phone numbers must be verified, so that we can make sure they can be assigned to their rightful owners. The `PhoneNumber` object holds all the necessary state around the verification process.

The verification process always starts with the [PhoneNumber.prepareVerification()](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/clerkjs/phonenumber#prepare-verification) method, which will send a one-time verification code via an SMS message. The second and final step involves an attempt to complete the verification by calling the [PhoneNumber.attemptVerification()](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/clerkjs/phonenumber#attempt-verification) method, passing the one-time code as a parameter.

Finally, phone numbers are used as part of [multi-factor authentication](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/custom-flows/multifactor). Users receive an SMS message with a one-time code that they need to provide as an extra verification step.
