The `UserProfileView` renders a comprehensive user profile interface that displays user information and provides account management options. It includes personal information, security settings, account switching, and sign-out functionality.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `UserProfileView` only appears when a user is signed in.

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `clerkTheme`
  - `ClerkTheme`

  The theme to apply to the `UserProfileView`. This will override any theme applied to the `UserProfileView`'s parent view, or configured in the `Clerk` global object.

  - `onDismiss`
  - `() -> Unit`

  A callback function that is called when the user dismisses the view, such as when they tap a back button or close button. Use this callback to handle navigation or perform cleanup when the user closes the profile view, for example, navigating back to the previous screen or updating your app's state.
</Properties>

## Usage

The following example shows how to use the `UserProfileView` in your Android app.

### Full-screen profile view

Use `UserProfileView` as a full-screen view when you want to dedicate the entire screen to profile management.

```kotlin

import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
import androidx.compose.runtime.getValue
import androidx.lifecycle.compose.collectAsStateWithLifecycle
import com.clerk.api.Clerk
import com.clerk.ui.userprofile.UserProfileView

@Composable
fun ProfileView() {
  val user by Clerk.userFlow.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
  if (user != null) {
    UserProfileView()
  }
}
```
