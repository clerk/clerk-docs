Organizations let you group users with Roles and Permissions, enabling you to build multi-tenant B2B apps like Slack (workspaces), Linear (teams), or Vercel (projects) where users can switch between different team contexts. This tutorial will demonstrate how to add Organizations, create and switch Organizations, and protect routes by Organization and Roles.

<Steps>
  ## Add `<OrganizationSwitcher/>` to your app

  The `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component is the easiest way to let users create, switch between, and manage Organizations. It's recommended to place it in your app's header or navigation so it's always accessible to your users. For example:

  ```astro {{ filename: 'src/layouts/Layout.astro', fold: [[27, 34]] }}
    ---
    import {
      SignedIn,
      SignedOut,
      UserButton,
      SignInButton,
  +   OrganizationSwitcher,
    } from '@clerk/astro/components'
    ---

    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
        <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
        <title>Astro Basics</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <header>
  +       <OrganizationSwitcher />
          <SignedOut>
            <SignInButton mode="modal" />
          </SignedOut>
          <SignedIn>
            <UserButton />
          </SignedIn>
        </header>
        <slot />
      </body>
    </html>

    <style>
      html,
      body {
        margin: 0;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
      }
    </style>
  ```

  ## Access Organization data

  <Tabs items={['Server-side', 'Client-side']}>
    <Tab>
      To access information about the currently [Active Organization](!active-organization) on the server-side, use [`clerkClient()`](/docs/reference/astro/overview#example-use-clerk-client-to-get-a-users-information) to call the [`getOrganization()`](/docs/reference/backend/organization/get-organization) method, which returns the Backend [`Organization`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-organization) object. You'll need to pass an `orgId`, which you can access from the [`Auth`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) object.

      ```astro {{ filename: 'src/pages/index.astro' }}
      ---
      import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro'
      import { SignedIn, SignedOut } from '@clerk/astro/components'
      import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/astro/server'

      // Use the `locals.auth()` local to access the `Auth` object
      // https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object
      const { isAuthenticated, orgId, orgRole } = Astro.locals.auth()

      let organization = null
      if (isAuthenticated && orgId) {
        organization = await clerkClient(Astro).organizations.getOrganization({ organizationId: orgId })
      }
      ---

      <Layout title="Clerk + Astro">
        <SignedOut>
          <p>Sign in to try Clerk out!</p>
        </SignedOut>
        <SignedIn>
          {
            organization && (
              <div class="p-8">
                <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
                  Welcome to the <strong>{organization.name}</strong> organization
                </h1>
                <p class="mb-6">
                  Your role in this organization: <strong>{orgRole}</strong>
                </p>
              </div>
            )
          }
        </SignedIn>
      </Layout>
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      To access information about the currently [Active Organization](!active-organization) on the client-side, use the [`$organizationStore`](/docs/reference/astro/client-side-helpers/organization-store) store, which returns the [`Organization`](/docs/reference/javascript/organization) object. This requires that you've [set up your Astro app to be integrated with React](/docs/reference/astro/react).

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'components/Home.tsx' }}
      import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react'
      import { $organizationStore } from '@clerk/astro/client'

      export default function Home() {
        const organization = useStore($organizationStore)

        // Handle loading state
        if (organization === undefined) return <p>Loading...</p>

        // Handle no Active Organization state
        if (organization === null) return <p>Set an Active Organization to access this page.</p>

        return <p>This current Organization is {organization.name}</p>
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ## Visit your app

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit your app locally at [`localhost:4321`](http://localhost:4321).

  ### Enable Organizations

  When prompted, select **Enable Organizations**.

  ### Create first user and Organization

  You must sign in to use Organizations. When prompted, select **Sign in to continue**. Then, authenticate to create your first user.

  Since you selected disabled personal accounts when you enabled Organizations, every user must be in at least one Organization. [Clerk will prompt you](!choose-organization) to create an Organization for your user.

  ## Create and switch Organizations

  At this point, Clerk should have redirected you to a page with the [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher) component. This component allows you to create, switch between, and manage Organizations.

  1. Select the `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component, then **Create an organization**.
  1. Enter `Acme Corp` as the Organization name.
  1. Invite users to your Organization and select their Role.

  ## Protect routes by Organization and Roles

  You can protect content and even entire routes based on Organization membership, Roles, and Permissions by performing [authorization checks](!authorization-check).

  In the following example, the page is protected from unauthenticated users, users that don't have the `org:admin` Role, and users that are not in the `Acme Corp` Organization. It uses the [`has()`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#has) helper to perform the authorization check for the `org:admin` Role.

  <Tabs items={['Server-side', 'Client-side']}>
    <Tab>
      ```astro {{ filename: 'src/pages/protected.astro' }}
      ---
      import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro'
      import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/astro/server'

      const { isAuthenticated, has, orgId, orgRole } = Astro.locals.auth()

      const requiredOrgName = 'Acme Corp'

      let organization = null
      if (isAuthenticated && orgId) {
        organization = await clerkClient(Astro).organizations.getOrganization({ organizationId: orgId })
      }
      ---

      <Layout title="Protected Page">
        <!-- Check if the user is authenticated -->
        {!isAuthenticated && <p>You must be signed in to access this page.</p>}

        <!-- Check if there is an Active Organization -->
        {!organization && <p>Set an Active Organization to access this page.</p>}

        <!-- Check if the user has the required Role to access this page -->
        {!has({ role: 'org:admin' }) && <p>You must be an admin to access this page.</p>}

        <!-- Check if Organization name matches (e.g. 'Acme Corp') -->
        {
          organization &&
            (organization.name !== requiredOrgName ? (
              <p>
                This page is only accessible in the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization.
                Switch to the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization to access this page.
              </p>
            ) : (
              <p>
                You are currently signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> in the{' '}
                <strong>{organization.name}</strong> Organization.
              </p>
            ))
        }
      </Layout>
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      ```tsx {{ filename: 'components/Home.tsx' }}
      import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react'
      import { $organizationStore } from '@clerk/astro/client'
      import { useAuth } from '@clerk/astro/react'

      export default function Home() {
        const organization = useStore($organizationStore)
        const { has, isSignedIn } = useAuth()
        const requiredOrgName = 'Acme Corp'

        if (!isSignedIn) return <p>You must be signed in to access this page.</p>

        // Handle loading state
        if (organization === undefined) return <p>Loading...</p>

        // Handle no Active Organization state
        if (organization === null) return <p>Set an Active Organization to access this page.</p>

        // Check if user has the required Role to access this page
        if (!has({ role: 'org:admin' })) {
          return <p>You must be an admin to access this page.</p>
        }

        // Check if Organization name matches (e.g. 'Acme Corp')
        if (organization.name !== requiredOrgName) {
          return (
            <p>
              This page is only accessible in the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization. Switch
              to the <strong>{requiredOrgName}</strong> Organization to access this page.
            </p>
          )
        }

        return (
          <p>
            You are currently signed in as an <strong>admin</strong> in the{' '}
            <strong>{organization.name}</strong> Organization.
          </p>
        )
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  Navigate to [`localhost:4321/protected`](localhost:4321/protected). You should see a green message confirming you are an admin in `Acme Corp`. Use the `<OrganizationSwitcher/>` to switch Organizations or rename the Organization to show the red message.
