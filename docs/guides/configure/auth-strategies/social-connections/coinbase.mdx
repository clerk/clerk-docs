Enabling OAuth with [Coinbase](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/coinbase-app/docs/coinbase-app) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Coinbase account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Coinbase**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Coinbase as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Coinbase**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create a Coinbase app

  > [!NOTE]
  > Coinbase automatically creates a default project for you named `Project 1`. Select the icon next to the project name to rename it.

  1. In your [Coinbase Developer Platform project dashboard](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/projects), select the **API keys** tab.
  1. Select **OAuth**, then select **Create client**.
  1. Complete the required fields. In **Redirect URIs**, paste the **Redirect URI** you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Create client**. The page will refresh and you should see the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Save these values somewhere secure.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ### Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/test-your-connection" />
