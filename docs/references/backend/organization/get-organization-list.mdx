# `getOrganizationList()`

Retrieves a list of organizations.

```tsx {{ prettier: false }}
function getOrganizationList: (params: GetOrganizationListParams) => Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<Organization[]>>;
```

## `GetOrganizationListParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `limit?` | `number` | The number of results to return. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than 501. Can be used for paginating the results together with `offset`. Defaults to `10`. |
| `offset?` | `number` | Skip the first `offset` results when paginating. Needs to be an integer greater or equal to zero. To be used in conjunction with `limit`. Defaults to `0`. |
| `includeMembersCount?` | `boolean` | Whether the member counts of each organization should be included in the response or not. |
| `query?` | `string` | Filters organizations with ID, name, or slug that match the given query. Uses exact match for organization ID and partial match for name and slug. |
| `orderBy?` | `'name' \| 'created_at' \| 'members_count'` | Return organizations in a particular order. Prefix with a `-` to reverse the order. Prefix with a `+` to list in ascending order. Defaults to `'-created_at'`. |

## Examples

### Basic

In the following example, you can see that the returned [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) includes `data`, which is an array of [`Organization`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-organization) objects, and `totalCount`, which indicates the total number of organizations in the system.

While the response can return up to 10 data items, for the sake of brevity, only two are shown in this example response.

```tsx {{ prettier: false }}
const response = await clerkClient.organizations.
getOrganizationList();

console.log(response);
/*
{
  data: [
    _Organization {
      id: 'org_123',
      name: 'Test Org',
      slug: 'test-org',
      imageUrl: 'https://img.clerk.com/eyJ...',
      hasImage: false,
      createdBy: 'user_123',
      createdAt: 1705534741971,
      updatedAt: 1705534741971,
      publicMetadata: {},
      privateMetadata: {},
      maxAllowedMemberships: 3,
      adminDeleteEnabled: true,
      members_count: undefined
    },
    _Organization {
      id: 'org_456',
      name: 'Test Org 2',
      slug: 'test-org-2',
      imageUrl: 'https://img.clerk.com/eyJ.',
      hasImage: false,
      createdBy: 'user_123',
      createdAt: 1705526650229,
      updatedAt: 1705526650229,
      publicMetadata: {},
      privateMetadata: {},
      maxAllowedMemberships: 3,
      adminDeleteEnabled: true,
      members_count: undefined
    },
    ...
  ],
  totalCount: 25,
}
*/
```

### Limit the number of results

Retrieves organization list that is filtered by the number of results.

```tsx {{ prettier: false }}
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList({
  // returns the first 10 results
  limit: 10,
});
```

### Skip results

Retrieves organization list that is filtered by the number of results to skip.

```tsx {{ prettier: false }}
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList({
  // skips the first 10 results
  offset: 10,
});
```

### Filter by query

Retrieves list of organizations that match the query.

```tsx {{ prettier: false }}
// returns organizations that have 'test' in their name
const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationList({ query: 'test' })
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/organizations`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organizations#operation/ListOrganizations) for more details.
