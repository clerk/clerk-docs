title: Enterprise SSO
description: Clerk provides Enterprise SSO to authenticate users via federated Identity Providers such such as Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace and more.
---

With Enterprise SSO, users can sign in seamlessly using their IdP's credentials and have their user data synchronized with Clerk. You can learn more about the process in the [Enterprise SSO authentication flows](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/authentication-flows) and [Account linking](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/account-linking) guides, or you can jump straight into integrating an IdP with Clerk.

Clerk offers direct SAML integrations with [Microsoft Azure AD](/docs/authentication/saml/azure), [Google Workspace](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/saml/google), and [Okta Workforce](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/saml/okta) as IdPs. However, you can also [integrate with any other IdP](/docs/authentication/saml/custom-provider) that supports the SAML protocol.

For [EASIE](https://easie.dev), Clerk offers integration with Google Workspace and Microsoft Entra ID. For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured credentials and redirect URIs - no other configuration is needed. For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client Secret, following the same steps outlined in our guides:

- [Google](docs/authentication/social-connections/google)
- [Microsoft](docs/authentication/social-connections/azure)

## SAML vs. EASIE

[EASIE](https://easie.dev) allows for enterprise-grade SSO through a multi-tenant OpenID provider. It is designed to support an easier alternative to fully fledged SAML SSO, without requiring additional configuration in the Identity Provider and potential sharing of credentials or secrets.

A key consideration is [security](https://easie.dev#security). While Clerk implements measures to [address potential security issues](https://easie.dev/#mitigating-tenant-crossover-vulnerabilities), applications that require single-tenant Identity Providers should opt for SAML SSO.

## Add your first Enterprise Connection

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
1. Click on **Add connection** on the top right and select **For specific domains**.
1. Select one of the Identity Provider options based on your protocol of choice.
1. On the next page, enter any required configuration information.

## Allow subdomains for SAML

Authenticating via SAML SSO requires the user's email address domain to match the exact domain the SAML connection has been configured with. By default, subdomains are not supported. For example, a user with the email address `john@sales.example.com` would not be able to use a SAML connection with the `example.com` domain in order to authenticate.

To support SAML SSO with subdomains,

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
1. Select the SAML Connection you want to allow subdomains for.
1. Select the **Advanced** tab.
1. Toggle on the **Allow subdomains** option.

> [!NOTE]
> To enable the **Allow subdomains** option, your SAML Connection domain must be an eTLD+1.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### I've enabled other strategies but they don't work

A Clerk application can have multiple authentication strategies, but a domain that enables Enterprise SSO can not. Once Enterprise SSO is enabled for a domain, there can be no other authentication methods for that specific domain. This is in line with an organization's intent to manage their users' identity from one place. This will allow your Clerk application to enable Enterprise SSO connections for certain domains while others use non-Enterprise SSO methods depending on each organization's needs.

### Will Enterprise SSO work for my existing users?

Yes, Enterprise SSO will work for your existing users as well! If you enable SAML or EASIE, any existing users with an email address that matches the SAML or EASIE Connection domain will have to authenticate on the IdP side and an Enterprise Account will be linked to their existing account.

### What happens if I have multi-factor enabled at Clerk?

This will work: Once the user comes back from the IdP, they will need to go through the extra factors of authentication. This is in case you need to add extra factors on top of what your IdP supports (or in case they don't). You can choose to not enable this feature if you wish.

### What happens if I delete the Enterprise Connection? Will my users be deleted?

The users will not be deleted, so your application will not break. However, they will need to use another [strategy](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#authentication-strategies) such as password, email OTP, etc., to authenticate themselves moving forward.

### Does Clerk support IdP-initiated SSO?

Yes, for SAML only. Clerk supports both Service Provider-initiated (SP-initiated) and Identity Provider-initiated (IdP-initiated) SSO flows. [Learn more](/docs/authentication/saml/authentication-flows).

### How much does it cost?

For development instances, Enterprise Connections will always be free, but capped to 5.

Production instances require the Pro plan and the Enhanced Authentication Add-on. Please see [pricing](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.

### Can I get a bulk discount?

Yes, [reach out to support](/contact/support){{ target: '_blank' }} to work out a custom plan.
