# Testing with Cypress

> [!WARNING]
> Our `@clerk/testing` package only supports end-to-end testing. Unit tests are not supported.

Testing with Cypress requires the use of Clerk's [Testing Tokens](/docs/testing/overview#testing-tokens) to bypass various bot detection mechanisms that typically safeguard Clerk applications against malicious bots. Without Testing Tokens, you may encounter "Bot traffic detected" errors in your requests.

This guide aims to help you set up your environment for creating Clerk-authenticated tests with Cypress.

> [!NOTE]
> Check out the [demo repo](https://github.com/clerk/example-cypress-nextjs) that tests a Clerk-powered application using [Testing Tokens](/docs/testing/overview#testing-tokens).

<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/testing`

  Clerk's testing package provides integration helpers for popular testing frameworks. Install it by running the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
    ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm i @clerk/testing --save-dev
    ```

    ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add -D @clerk/testing
    ```

    ```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/testing -D
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your API keys

  In your test runner, set your publishable and secret key as the `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` environment variables, respectively.

  To find your keys:

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
  1. In the navigation sidebar, select **API Keys**.
  1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.

  > [!WARNING]
  > Ensure you provide the secret key in a secure manner, to avoid leaking it to third parties. For example, if you are using GitHub Actions, refer to [_Using secrets in GitHub Actions_](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).

  ### Global setup

  To set up Clerk with Cypress, add the following code to your [`cypress.config.ts`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) file.

  ```tsx filename="cypress.config.ts"
  import { clerkSetup } from '@clerk/testing/cypress'
  import { defineConfig } from 'cypress'

  export default defineConfig({
    e2e: {
      setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
        return clerkSetup({ config })
      },
      baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000', // your app's URL
    },
  })
  ```

  `clerkSetup` will obtain a [Testing Token](/docs/testing/overview#testing-tokens) when your test suite starts, making it available for all subsequent tests to use.

  ### Use Clerk Testing Tokens

  Now that Cypress is configured with Clerk, you can use the `setupClerkTestingToken()` function in your tests to augment them with the Testing Token. See the following example:

  ```tsx filename="my-test.cy.ts"
  import { setupClerkTestingToken } from '@clerk/testing/cypress'

  it('sign up', () => {
    setupClerkTestingToken()

    cy.visit('/sign-up')
    // ...
  })
  ```
</Steps>

## Custom Commands

The `@clerk/testing` package also provides [Cypress custom commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands) to sign in/sign out with Clerk in your Cypress tests without having to interact with the UI.
To use these commands, you must import them in your [Cypress E2E support file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Support-file), as shown in the following example.

```ts {{ filename: 'cypress/support/e2e.ts' }}
/// <reference types="cypress" />
import { addClerkCommands } from '@clerk/testing/cypress'
addClerkCommands({ Cypress, cy })

export {}
```

### `cy.clerkSignIn`

The `cy.clerkSignIn` command is used to sign in a user using Clerk. This custom command supports only the following first factor strategies:

- Password
- Phone code
- Email code

Multi-factor authentication is not supported.

> [!NOTE]
> This helper internally uses the `setupClerkTestingToken()` helper, so you don't need to call it separately.

#### Prerequisites

- Before calling this command, you must call `cy.visit`.
- Before using this command, navigate to a non-protected page that loads Clerk.

#### Parameters

`cy.clerkSignIn` accepts an object with the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `strategy` | `'password' \| 'phone_code' \| 'email_code'` | The sign-in strategy. Supported strategies are: <br /><ul><li>`password`: The command will sign in the user using the provided password and identifier.</li><li>`phone_code`: You must have a user with a test phone number as an identifier (e.g., `+15555550100`).</li><li>`email_code`: You must have a user with a test email as an identifier (e.g., `your_email+clerk_test@example.com`).</li></ul> |
| `identifier` | `string` | The user's identifier. This could be a username, a phone number, or an email. |
| `password` | `string` | The user's password. This is required only if the `strategy` is set to `'password'`. |

#### Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the `cy.clerkSignIn()` command in a test to sign in a user.

```ts {{ filename: 'cypress/e2e/my-test.cy.ts' }}
it('sign in', () => {
  cy.visit(`/`)
  cy.clerkSignIn({ strategy: 'phone_code', identifier: '+15555550100' })
  cy.visit('/protected')
  // user is signed in from here on
})
```

### `cy.clerkSignOut`

The `cy.clerkSignOut` command is used to sign out the current user using Clerk.

#### Prerequisites

- Before calling this command, yu must call `cy.visit`.
- Before using this command, navigate to a page that loads Clerk.

#### Parameters

`cy.clerkSignOut` accepts an optional parameter `signOutOptions`, which includes the following properties:

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `sessionId?` | `string` | The ID of a specific session to sign out of. Useful for multi-session applications. |
| `redirectUrl?` | `string` | The redirect URL to navigate to after sign out is complete. |

#### Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the `cy.clerkSignOut()` command in a test to sign a user out.

```ts {{ filename: 'cypress/e2e/my-test.cy.ts' }}
it('sign out', () => {
  cy.visit(`/`)
  cy.clerkSignIn({ strategy: 'phone_code', identifier: '+15555550100' })
  cy.visit('/protected')
  cy.clerkSignOut()
  // user is signed out from here on
})
```

### `cy.clerkLoaded`

The `cy.clerkLoaded` command asserts that Clerk has been loaded.

#### Prerequisites

- Before calling this command, you must call `cy.visit`.
- Before using this command, navigate to a page that loads Clerk.

#### Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the `cy.clerkLoaded()` command in a test to assert that Clerk has been loaded.

```ts {{ filename: 'cypress/e2e/my-test.cy.ts' }}
it('check Clerk loaded', () => {
  cy.visit(`/`)
  cy.clerkLoaded()
  // Clerk has been loaded from here on
})
```
