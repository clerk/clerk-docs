![The \<Waitlist /> component renders a form that allows users to join for early access to your app.](/docs/images/ui-components/waitlist.png){{ style: { maxWidth: '460px' } }}

In **Waitlist** mode, users can register their interest in your app by joining a waitlist. This mode is ideal for apps in early development stages or those wanting to generate interest before launch. [Learn more about additional features available in **Waitlist** mode](/docs/authentication/configuration/restrictions#waitlist).

The `<Waitlist />` component renders a form that allows users to join for early access to your app.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using Next.js, the`<Waitlist />` component is available in `@clerk/nextjs@6.2.0` and above.

## Enable Waitlist mode

Before using the `<Waitlist />` component, you must enable **Waitlist** mode in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Restrictions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/restrictions) page.
1. Under the **Sign-up modes** section, enable **Waitlist**.

## Properties

All props are optional.

<Properties>
  - `appearance`
  - <code>[Appearance](/docs/customization/overview) | undefined</code>

  Optional object to style your components. Will only affect [Clerk components](/docs/components/overview) and not [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview) pages.

  ---

  - `afterJoinWaitlistUrl`
  - `string`

  Full URL or path to navigate to after joining the waitlist.

  ---

  - `signInUrl`
  - `string`

  Full URL or path to the sign in page. Use this property to provide the target of the 'Sign In' link that's rendered. It's recommended to use [the environment variable](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) instead.
</Properties>

## Usage with frameworks

> [!WARNING]
> Before using the `<Waitlist />` component, you must provide the `waitlistUrl` prop either in the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider#properties) or [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in#properties) component to ensure proper functionality.

The following example includes a basic implementation of the `<Waitlist />` component. You can use this as a starting point for your own implementation.

<Tabs items={["Next.js", "React"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```jsx {{ filename: 'app/waitlist/[[...waitlist]]/page.tsx' }}
    import { Waitlist } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    export default function WaitlistPage() {
      return <Waitlist />
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```jsx {{ filename: '/waitlist.tsx' }}
    import { Waitlist } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

    export default function WaitlistPage() {
      return <Waitlist />
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
