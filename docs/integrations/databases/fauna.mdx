Integrating Fauna with Clerk gives you the benefits of using a Fauna database while leveraging Clerk's authentication, prebuilt components, and webhooks.

This guide will walk you through the steps to integrate Fauna with Clerk in your Next.js app.

<Steps>
  ### Get your Clerk publishable key and JWKS URL

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env.local` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
    1. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable key.
    1. In the left sidebar, select **Show JWT public key**.
    1. Copy the **JWKS URL**.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env.local' }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_JWKS_URL={{jwks_url}}
  ```

  ### Configure Fauna

  1. Navigate to the [Fauna Dashboard](https://dashboard.fauna.com/) and select your database.
  1. Select the **Access Providers** tab and select **Create Access Provider**.
  1. Fill out the form:
     - Enter a **Name** for the access provider, such as Clerk.
     - Copy and save the **Audience** URL. You will need this later.
     - In **Issuer**, paste the Clerk publishable key you copied in the previous step.
     - In **JWKS Endpoint**, paste the Clerk **JWKS URL** you copied in the previous step.
     - Select **Create**.
  1. Select the access provider that you just created.
  1. Update the access provider's FSL schema to include a [user-defined role](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/learn/security/roles/). For example:
     ```fsl {{ mark: [6, 7] }}
     access provider Clerk {
       // Don't change the values of the issuer or jwks_uri fields.
       issuer "..."
       jwks_uri "..."

       // Adds a user-defined role to JWTs created by the access provider.
       role <YOUR_ROLE>
     }
     ```
  1. Select **Save**.

  ### Create a JWT template in Clerk

  Clerk's JWT templates allow you to generate a new valid Fauna authentication token for each signed in user. These tokens allow authenticated users to access your data with Fauna's API.

  To create a JWT template for Fauna:

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=jwt-templates).
  1. In the navigation sidebar, select **JWT Templates**.
  1. Select the **New template** button, then select **Fauna** from the list of options.
  1. Configure your template:
     - The value of the **Name** field will be required when using the template in your code. For this tutorial, name it `fauna`.
     - You can leave all other fields at their default settings or customize them to your needs. See the [JWT template guide](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates#creating-a-template) to learn more about these settings.
     - In the **Claims** section, set the `aud` claim to the **Audience URL** you copied from Fauna in Step 2. The URL format should be `https://db.fauna.com/db/<YOUR_FAUNA_DB_ID>`. You can include additional claims if youâ€™d like, but `aud` is the only required one. [Shortcodes](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates#shortcodes) are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.
     - Select **Save** from the notification bubble to complete setup.

  ### Install the Fauna library

  Add the Fauna library to your project.

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm i fauna
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add fauna
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add fauna
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Authenticate queries in your Next.js app

  You can now create Fauna JWTs in Clerk using the JWT template you created in the previous step. Generate the Fauna JWT by calling Clerk's [`useAuth().getToken`](/docs/references/react/use-auth) method, and use it to authenticate with Fauna as an end user, as shown in the following example:

  ```jsx
  import React from 'react'
  import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'
  import { Client, fql } from 'fauna'

  const Example = () => {
    const { getToken } = useAuth()
    const [message, setMessage] = React.useState('')

    const makeQuery = async () => {
      let client
      try {
        const secret = await getToken({ template: '<your-template-name>' })
        client = new Client({ secret: secret })
        const response = await client.query(fql`'Hello World!'`)
        setMessage(response)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(error)
        setMessage('Error occurred')
      } finally {
        if (client) client.close()
      }
    }

    return (
      <>
        <button onClick={makeQuery}>Make authenticated query</button>
        <p>Message: {message}</p>
      </>
    )
  }

  export default Example
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > The `getToken({ template: <your-template-name> })` call is asynchronous and returns a Promise that needs to be resolved before accessing the token value. This token is short-lived for better security and should be called before every request to your Fauna database. The caching and refreshing of the token are handled automatically by Clerk.
