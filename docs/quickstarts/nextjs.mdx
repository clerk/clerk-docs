  The next major version of the Clerk Next.js SDK is coming soon! If you're just starting a project, consider [trying out the Core 2 beta](https://beta.clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs) instead.
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Install `@clerk/nextjs`

Clerk's [Next.js SDK](/docs/references/nextjs/overview) has prebuilt components, React hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

To get started using Clerk with Next.js, add the SDK to your project:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/nextjs
  ```

```bash filename="terminal"
yarn add @clerk/nextjs
```

```bash filename="terminal"
pnpm add @clerk/nextjs
```

</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set your environment variables

1. If you don't have an `.env.local` file in the root directory of your Next.js project, create one now.
2. Find your Clerk publishable key and secret key. If you're signed into Clerk, the `.env.local` snippet below will contain your keys. Otherwise:
  - Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) and select your application.
  - In the navigation sidebar, select **API Keys**.
  - You can copy your keys from the **Quick Copy** section.
3. Add your keys to your `.env.local` file.

The final result should look as follows:

  <InjectKeys>

  ```sh filename=".env.local"
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  </InjectKeys>

### Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your app

All Clerk hooks and components must be children of the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component, which provides active session and user context.

Select your preferred router below to learn how to make this data available across your entire app:

<CodeBlockTabs type="router" options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
  ```tsx filename="/src/app/layout.tsx" {1,10-14}
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
  import './globals.css'

  export default function RootLayout({
    children,
  }: {
    children: React.ReactNode
  }) {
    return (
      <ClerkProvider>
        <html lang="en">
          <body>{children}</body>
        </html>
      </ClerkProvider>
    )
  }
  ```

  ```tsx filename="_app.tsx" {2,6-8}
    import '@/styles/globals.css'
    import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs";
    import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
    function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </ClerkProvider>
      );
    }
    export default MyApp;
    ```

</CodeBlockTabs>

### Add authentication to your app

Now that Clerk is installed and mounted in your application, you can decide which pages are public and which should require authentication to access:

1. Create a `middleware.ts` file at the root of your project, or in your `src/` directory if you have one.
2. In your `middleware.ts`, export Clerk's [`authMiddleware()`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware) helper:
  ```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
  import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

  export default authMiddleware({});
  ```
3. With `authMiddleware()`, authentication will be enabled by default on all routes that your Next.js middleware runs on, blocking access to all signed out visitors. You can specify valid routes using Next.js's [`matcher`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#matcher). Add the following code to your `middleware.ts` to protect your entire application:

  ```tsx filename="middleware.ts" {15}
  import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

  export default authMiddleware({
    // Routes that can be accessed while signed out
    publicRoutes: ['/anyone-can-visit-this-route'],
    // Routes that can always be accessed, and have
    // no authentication information
    ignoredRoutes: ['/no-auth-in-this-route'],
  });

  export const config = {
    // Protects all routes, including api/trpc.
    // See https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware
    // for more information about configuring your Middleware
    matcher: ["/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
  };
  ```

<Callout type="info">
  See the [`authMiddleware()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#default-behaviour) docs to learn more about `publicRoutes` and `ignoredRoutes`.
</Callout>

### Try accessing your app

Access your app to verify that authentication is enabled:

1. Run your project with the following terminal command from the root directory of your project:
  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash filename="terminal"
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    pnpm dev
    ```

  </CodeBlockTabs>
2. Visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to access your app. The Middleware will redirect you to your Sign Up page, provided by Clerk's [Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview) feature.
3. Sign up to gain access to your application.
4. Sign into your new account. You should be able to access it now.

### Embed the `<UserButton />`

[`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button) is a [prebuilt component](/docs/components/overview) that allows users to sign in, log out, and manage their account information.

Use the following code to add a `<UserButton />` to your app:

<CodeBlockTabs type="router" options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" {1,6}
import { UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="h-screen">
      <UserButton />
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="pages/index.tsx" {1,7}
import { UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <header>
        <UserButton />
      </header>
      <div>Your home page's content can go here.</div>
    </>
  );
}
```

</CodeBlockTabs>

Then, visit your app's homepage at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to see the `<UserButton />` in action. It should show your avatar from the account you signed in with.

### Sign out

Finally, use the `<UserButton />` by selecting your avatar, then selecting **Sign out**.

</Steps>
