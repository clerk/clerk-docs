How to set up social connection with LINE

## Overview

Adding social connection with LINE to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

> [!NOTE]
> Clerk preconfigured shared OAuth credentials are using **Japan** as the LINE region

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your LINE account.

> [!NOTE]
> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a LINE account and a LINE OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a LINE developer account. To create one, [click here](https://developers.line.biz/en/).

## Configuring LINE social connection

First, you need to create a new provider. Fill in a name and click **Create**.

The next step is to create a new **LINE Login channel**. You will have to select the provider you created before, the region to provide your LINE service, a channel name, and description and finally select **Web app** as the **App type**.

In the next screen, after the app has been created, you will find the **Basic settings** of the application. If you want to also make email address available for your application, you will have to apply for **Email address permission** in the bottom of your app's **Basic settings**.

Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections). In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **LINE**. Toggle on **Use custom credentials** and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Paste the value into the **LINE login â†’ Callback URL** input.

Once all the above are complete, copy the **Channel ID** and **Channel secret.** Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.

Finally, select **Add connection** so that the settings are applied. Congratulations! Social connection with LINE is now configured for your instance.
