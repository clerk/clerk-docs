`OrganizationCustomPermissionKey` is a type that represents a user's permission in an organization. It will be string unless the developer has provided their own types through [`ClerkAuthorization`](/docs/guides/custom-types#example-custom-roles-and-permissions).

Clerk provides [default system permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#system-permissions). However, you can create [custom permissions](/docs/organizations/create-roles-permissions#create-a-new-permission-for-your-organization) as well.
