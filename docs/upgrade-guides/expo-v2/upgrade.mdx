# Upgrade to @clerk/clerk-expo v2

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to upgrade your application to use the latest version of the Clerk Expo SDK.

As of `@clerk/clerk-expo@2` the minimum required React Native version will be `0.73` which is the minimum required version from Expo `v50`. If you are using an older version of React Native and Expo, you will need to upgrade to `react-native@0.73` and `expo@50` or higher.
