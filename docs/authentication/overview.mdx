description: Learn how to configure authentication and user management for your Clerk application.
---

Clerk supports multiple authentication strategies so that you can implement the strategy that makes sense for _your_ users. You can use Clerk's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal//overview), [pre-built components](/docs/components/overview), or [build your own custom flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

## Configuration

Clerk's configuration settings affect how the users of your application can [sign up and sign in](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options) and which properties are editable via their user profile. You can also manage [user sessions](/docs/authentication/configuration/session-options), [control who gets access](/docs/authentication/configuration/restrictions) to your application, and [customize the email & SMS messages](/docs/authentication/configuration/email-sms-templates) that are sent by Clerk during authentication flows. All of these settings can be found under the **User & Authentication** section in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).
