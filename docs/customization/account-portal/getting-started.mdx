title: Getting started with the Account Portal
description: The Account Portal offers a comprehensive solution for managing user authentication and profile management in your web application and is the fastest way to add Clerk's authentication to your application with minimal code required.
---

To integrate the Account Portal into your application, simply follow one of the [quickstart guides](/docs/quickstarts/overview). Once your application is set up, all you have to do is run it. Clerk will automatically redirect your users to the Account Portal sign-up/sign-in pages. After successful authentication, users will be redirected back to your application with an active session.

You can also integrate the Account Portal into your application using Clerk's prebuilt components. For example, the [`<SignUpButton>`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-up-button) and [`<SignInButton>`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button) components will redirect users to the Account Portal sign-up/sign-in pages if no props or [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) are configured to override this behavior.

> [!NOTE]
> **Dynamic Development Host Detection**
>
> For development environments, the development host (e.g. [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)) is dynamically detected by Clerk at runtime and tied to your client browser. We store this as the ‘home origin’ for your application and it is equivalent to your application domain in production environments.

## Accessing your pages

For development environments, Clerk will issue you a randomly generated domain on "accounts.dev". In production, by default, the URLs for your Account Portal are the following:

```sh
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/sign-in
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/sign-up
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/user
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/organization
https://accounts.<your-domain>.com/create-organization
```

To access these links, in the Clerk Dashboard, go to the **[Account Portal](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal)** page and then open the **Pages** tab.
