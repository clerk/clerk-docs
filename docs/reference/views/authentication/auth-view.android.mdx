title: '`AuthView`'
description: Clerk's AuthView renders a UI for signing in and signing up users on Android.
sdk: android

![The AuthView renders a comprehensive authentication interface that handles both user sign-in and sign-up flows.](/docs/images/ui-components/android-auth-view.png){{ style: { maxWidth: '460px' } }}

The `AuthView` renders a comprehensive authentication interface with support for multiple sign-up flows and sign-in methods, multi-factor authentication, password reset, and account recovery. The functionality of the `AuthView` is controlled by the instance settings you specify in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), such as [sign-in and sign-up options](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options) and [social connections](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/all-providers).
By default, the `AuthView` will automatically determine whether to sign users in or sign them up based on whether they already have an account. This is the default mode that provides seamless authentication without requiring users to choose between sign-in and sign-up.

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `modifier`

  - `Modifier`

  - A modifier that gets applied to the `AuthView` composable. This is by default applied to the top level `NavDisplay` and shouldn't be used
    to change the appearance of the `AuthView` itself.
</Properties>

## Usage

The following examples show how to use the `AuthView` in your Android app.

### Basic usage

```kotlin

import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
import androidx.lifecycle.compose.collectAsStateWithLifecycle
import com.clerk.api.Clerk

  val user by Clerk.userFlow.collecAsStateWithLifecycle()
  Box(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(), contentAlignment = Alignment.Center) {
    if (user != null) {

      AuthView()
