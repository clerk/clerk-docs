# Use Clerk with Next.js

Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Next.js application. Clerk works seamlessly on both client side and server side components.

## Install @clerk/nextjs

Once you have a Next.js application ready, you need to install Clerk's Next.js SDK. This gives you access to prebuilt components and hooks, as well as our helpers for Next.js API routes, server-side rendering, and middleware.

<CodeBlockTabs options={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  ``` bash filename="your-project" copy
  npm install @clerk/nextjs
  ```
  ``` bash filename="your-project" copy
   yarn add @clerk/nextjs
   ```
   ``` bash filename="your-project" copy
   pnpm i @clerk/nextjs
   ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Set Environment Keys

Below is an example of an `.env.local` file. To get your keys go to the API Keys page on the [Clerk dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).

```sh copy filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
```

## Mount `<ClerkProvider>`

Update your root layout to include the `<ClerkProvider>` wrapper. The `<ClerkProvider>` component wraps your Next.js application to provide active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components. It is recommended that the `<ClerkProvider>` wraps the `<body>` to enable the context to be accessible anywhere within the app.

```tsx copy filename="app/layout.tsx"
import React from "react";
import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs/app-beta";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <title>Next.js 13 with Clerk</title>
      </head>
      <ClerkProvider>
        <body>{children}</body>
      </ClerkProvider>
    </html>
  );
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
 The root layout is a server component, if you plan to use the `<ClerkProvider>` outside the root layout it will need to be a server component as well.
 </Callout>

Clerk offers a set of prebuilt components that you can use to embed sign in, sign up, and other user management functions into your Next.js application.

The functionality of the components are controlled by the instance settings you specify in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev).

## Build Your Sign Up

```tsx copy filename="app/sign-up/page.tsx"
import { SignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs/app-beta";

export default function Page() {
  return <SignUp signInUrl="/sign-in" />;
}
```

## Build Your Sign In

```tsx copy filename="app/sign-in/page.tsx"
import { SignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs/app-beta";

export default function Page() {
  return <SignIn signUpUrl="/sign-up" />;
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  By default, the Clerk components inherit the font family. With create-next-app they don't apply a global font family. When you launch your application you may notice that the font family is different.
</Callout>

## Add Middleware

To use server side functionality, you need to add the Clerk middleware to your Next.js application. This allows you to access the session in your Next.js API routes and server-side rendered pages. Middleware should be placed at the root of your project.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
If you select `src/` as part of the create-next-app CLI you will need to place the middleware file inside of that directory.
</Callout>

```tsx copy filename="middleware.ts"
import { withClerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";

export default withClerkMiddleware((req: NextRequest) => {
  return NextResponse.next();
});

// Stop Middleware running on static files and public folder
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
     * - _next
     * - static (static files)
     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)
     * - public folder
     * - public folder
     */
    "/((?!static|.*\\..*|_next|favicon.ico).*)",
    "/",
  ],
}
```

## Protecting Your Pages

Clerk offers two ways to protect your Next.js application, you can use Next.js Middleware or using our Control Components.

<Tabs items={['Extending Middleware', 'Control Components']}>
<Tab>

Using Middleware is the most comprehensive way to implement page protection in your app. Below is an example of page protection using Middleware.

```ts copy filename="middleware.ts"
import { withClerkMiddleware, getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import type { NextRequest } from "next/server";

// Set the paths that don't require the user to be signed in
const publicPaths = ["/", "/sign-in*", "/sign-up*"];

const isPublic = (path: string) => {
  return publicPaths.find((x) =>
    path.match(new RegExp(`^${x}$`.replace("*$", "($|/)")))
  );
};

export default withClerkMiddleware((request: NextRequest) => {
  if (isPublic(request.nextUrl.pathname)) {
    return NextResponse.next();
  }
  // if the user is not signed in redirect them to the sign in page.
  const { userId } = getAuth(request);

  if (!userId) {
    // redirect the users to /pages/sign-in/[[...index]].ts

    const signInUrl = new URL("/sign-in", request.url);
    signInUrl.searchParams.set("redirect_url", request.url);
    return NextResponse.redirect(signInUrl);
  }
  return NextResponse.next();
});

// Stop Middleware running on static files and public folder
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
     * - _next
     * - static (static files)
     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)
     * - public folder
     * - public folder
     */
    "/((?!static|.*\\..*|_next|favicon.ico).*)",
    "/",
  ],
}
```

If you prefer to use Clerk's Control Components for page protection, the following examples shows you how to compose control components.

#### Server Component Example

```tsx copy filename="app/page.tsx"
import { SignedIn, SignedOut } from "@clerk/nextjs/app-beta";
import Link from "next/link";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Next.js 13 with Clerk</h1>
      <SignedIn>
        <p>You are signed in!</p>
      </SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>
        <p>You are signed out!</p>
        <Link href="/sign-in">Sign In</Link>
      </SignedOut>
    </main>
  );
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Read Session & User Data

Clerk provides a set of hooks and helpers that you can use to access the active session and user data in your Next.js application. We have included examples of how to use these helpers in both the client and server side to get you started.

### Client Side

#### `useAuth`

The `useAuth` hook is a convenient way to access the current auth state. This hook provides the minimal information needed for data-loading and helper methods to manage the current active session.

```tsx copy filename="app/example.tsx"
"use client";
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Example() {
  const { isLoaded, userId, sessionId, getToken } = useAuth();

  // In case the user signs out while on the page.
  if (!isLoaded || !userId) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      Hello, {userId} your current active session is {sessionId}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### `useUser`

The `useUser` hook is a convenient way to access the current user data where you need it. This hook provides the user data and helper methods to manage the current active session.

```tsx copy filename="pages/example.tsx"
"use client";
import { useUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Example() {
  const { isLoaded, isSignedIn, user } = useUser();

  if (!isLoaded || !isSignedIn) {
    return null;
  }

  return <div>Hello, {user.firstName} welcome to Clerk</div>;
}
```

### Server Side

#### API Routes

You can protect your API routes by using the `getAuth` helper and retrieve data from your own systems.

```tsx copy filename="pages/api/auth.ts"
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const { userId } = getAuth(req);
  if (!userId) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
    return;
  }
  // retrieve data from your database
  res.status(200).json({});
}
```

In some cases you may need the full user object, for example, if you want to access the user's email address or name. You can use the `clerkClient` helper to get the full user object.

```tsx copy filename="pages/api/auth.ts"
import { getAuth, clerkClient } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const { userId } = getAuth(req);

  if (!userId) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }

  const user = userId ? await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId) : null;

  // use the user object to decide what data to return

  return res.status(200).json({});
}
```

#### `currentUser()`

Current user loads the User object for the authenticated user from Clerk's backend API. This is helpful if you want to render information like their first and last name directly from the server.

Under the hood, this calls `fetch()` so it is automatically deduped per request.

```tsx copy filename="page.tsx"
import { currentUser } from "@clerk/nextjs/app-beta";
import type { User } from "@clerk/nextjs/api";

export default async function Page() {
  const user: User | null = await currentUser();
  // ...
}
```

#### `auth()`

We have introduced a new `auth()` helper that returns the same Authentication Object as `getAuth(req)` in middleware, getServerSideProps, and API routes.

Since request data like `headers()` and `cookies()` is now available in the global scope for Next.js, you no longer need to explicitly pass a Request object to Clerk

```tsx copy filename="app/page.tsx"
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/app-beta';

export default function Page() {
  const { userId } : { userId: string | null } = auth();
  // ...
}
```
