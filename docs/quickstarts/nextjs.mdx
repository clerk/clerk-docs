</TutorialHero>

<Steps>

### Install `@clerk/nextjs`

Clerk's [Next.js SDK](/docs/references/nextjs/overview) has prebuilt components, React hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

To get started using Clerk with Next.js, add the SDK to your project:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/nextjs
  ```

```bash filename="terminal"
yarn add @clerk/nextjs
```

```bash filename="terminal"
pnpm add @clerk/nextjs
```

</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set your environment keys

1. If you don't have a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your Next.js project, create one now.
2. Find your secret key and publishable key. If you're signed into Clerk, the `.env.local` snippet below will contain your both. Otherwise:
    - Navigate to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
    - Select your application, then select **🔑 API Keys** in the sidebar menu.
    - You can copy your keys from the **Quick Copy** section.
3. Add your keys to your `.env.local` file. 

The final result should look as follows:

    <InjectKeys>

    ```sh filename=".env.local"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
    ```

    </InjectKeys>

### Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your app

All Clerk hooks and components must be children of the [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component, which provides active session and user context.

Select your preferred router below to learn how to make this data available across your entire app:

<CodeBlockTabs type="router" options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
    ```tsx filename="/src/app/layout.tsx" {1,10-14}
    import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
    import './globals.css'

    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode
    }) {
      return (        
        <ClerkProvider>
          <html lang="en">
            <body>{children}</body>
          </html>
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    }
    ```

    ```tsx filename="_app.tsx" {2,6-8}
      import '@/styles/globals.css'
      import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
      import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
      function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
        return (          
          <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
          </ClerkProvider>
        );
      }
      export default MyApp;
      ```

</CodeBlockTabs>

### Add authentication to your app with middleware

Now that Clerk is installed and mounted in your application, you can decide which pages are public and which should require authentication to access:

1. Create a `middleware.ts` file at the root of your project, or in your `src/` directory if you have one.
2. In your `middleware.ts`, export Clerk's [`clerkMiddleware`](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware) helper:
    ```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
    import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

    export default clerkMiddleware({});
    ```
3. With `clerkMiddleware()`, authentication will be enabled by default on all routes that your Next.js middleware runs on, blocking access to all signed out visitors. You can specify valid routes using Next.js's [`matcher`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#matcher). Add the following code to your `middleware.ts` to protect your entire application:

    ```tsx filename="middleware.ts" {15}
    import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

    export default clerkMiddleware({
      // Routes that can be accessed while signed out
      publicRoutes: ['/anyone-can-visit-this-route'],
      // Routes that can always be accessed, and have
      // no authentication information
      ignoredRoutes: ['/no-auth-in-this-route'],
    });

    export const config = {
      // Protects all routes, including api/trpc.
      // See https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware
      // for more information about configuring your Middleware
      matcher: ["/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
    };
    ```

<Callout type="info">
  See the [`authMiddleware()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware#default-behaviour) docs to learn more about `publicRoutes` and `ignoredRoutes`.
</Callout>

### Try accessing your app

Access your app to verify that authentication is enabled:

1. Run your project with the following terminal command from the root directory of your project:
    <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
      ```bash filename="terminal"
      npm run dev
      ```

      ```bash filename="terminal"
      yarn dev
      ```

      ```bash filename="terminal"
      pnpm dev
      ```

    </CodeBlockTabs>
2. Visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to access your app. The Middleware will redirect you to your Sign Up page, provided by Clerk's [Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview) feature.
3. Sign up to gain access to your application.
4. Log into your new account. You should be able to access it now.

### Hide content from signed out users

You can control which content signed in and signed out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview). For this app, we'll use:

- [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
- [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.

Add the following code to your page component to hide some of its content:

<CodeBlockTabs type="router" options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" {1,6-11}
import { SignedIn, SignedOut } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SignedOut>
        <p>Only signed out users can see this.</p>
      </SignedOut>
      <SignedIn>
        <p>Only signed in users can see this.</p>
      </SignedIn>
    </div>
  )
}
```
```tsx filename="pages/index.tsx" {1,6-11}
import { SignedIn, SignedOut } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SignedOut>
        <p>Only signed out users can see this.</p>
      </SignedOut>
      <SignedIn>
        <p>Only signed in users can see this.</p>
      </SignedIn>
    </div>
  );
}
``` 
</CodeBlockTabs>

Now visit your app at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) while logged in or logged out. The content of the page should change based on your authentication status.

### Embed `<UserButton />` and `<SignInButton />`

To quickly add a sign-in button to your app with Clerk, you can use:

- [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button), a [prebuilt component](/docs/components/overview) that comes styled out of the box to show the avatar from the account the user is signed in with.
- [`<SignInButton />`(/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button)], an unstyled component.

Both allow users to log in, log out, and manage their account information.

Use the following code to add `<UserButton />` and `<SignInButton />` to your app: 

<CodeBlockTabs type="router" options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" {1,7,9-13,16}
import { SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SignedOut>
        <SignInButton />
        <p>Only signed out users can see this.</p>
        <SignInButton>
          <button>
            You can also wrap SignInButton around button elements
          </button>
        </SignInButton>
      </SignedOut>
      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton />
        <p>Only signed in users can see this.</p>
      </SignedIn>
    </div>
  )
}
```
```tsx filename="pages/index.tsx" {1,7,9-13,16}
import { SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SignedOut>
        <SignInButton />
        <p>Only signed out users can see this.</p>
        <SignInButton>
          <button>
            You can also wrap SignInButton around button elements
          </button>
        </SignInButton>
      </SignedOut>
      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton />
        <p>Only signed in users can see this.</p>
      </SignedIn>
    </div>
  );
}
``` 
</CodeBlockTabs>

Then, visit your app's homepage at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) while signed out or signed in to see `<SignInButton />` and `<UserButton />` in action.

### Sign out

Finally, use the `<UserButton />` by selecting your avatar, then selecting **Sign out**.
