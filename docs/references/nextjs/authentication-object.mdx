# `Authentication` object

Both [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) and  [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) return an `Authentication` object. This JavaScript object contains important information like session data, your user's ID, as well as their active organization ID.

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `actor` | Holds identifier for the user that is impersonating the current user. |
| `debug` | Used to help debug issues when using Clerk in development. |
| `getToken` | A function that returns a promise that resolves to the current user's session token; can also be used to retrieve a custom JWT template. |
| `orgId` | The current user's currently active organization ID. |
| `orgRole` | The current user's currently active organization role. |
| `orgSlug` | The current user's currently active organization slug. |
| `sessionClaim` | The current user's session claim. |
| `sessionId` | The current user's session ID. |
| `userId` | The current user's unique identifier. |
