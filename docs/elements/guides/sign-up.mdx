# Build a sign-up flow

In this guide you'll learn how to build a complete sign-up flow using Clerk Elements components.

<Callout type="info">

Clerk Elements currently only works with Next.js and [Clerk Core 2](https://clerk.com/changelog/2024-04-19). As it gets closer to a stable release, support for additional frameworks will be added. If your Next.js application is already using Clerk, make sure to [upgrade to Core 2](/docs/upgrade-guides/core-2/nextjs). If you're starting from scratch, follow the [Next.js quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs) before proceeding.

</Callout>

<Steps>

### Add a sign-up route

Create a new route in your Next.js application. The route needs to be an [optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments) so the sign-up flow can handled nested paths. Add the following snippet to `/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx`:

```tsx filename="/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx"
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignUp from '@clerk/elements/sign-up'

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <SignUp.Root>
    </SignUp.Root>
  )
}
```

You've also added two imports, which you'll use as you build out the rest of the flow. `<SignUp.Root>` manages the sign-up state and handles connecting the components to Clerk's APIs.

### Add the start step

The Clerk authentication flows are made up of **steps**. Steps handle rendering the UI for each part of the flow. To allow users to create a sign-up attempt, the `start` step needs to be rendered. Use the `<SignUp.Step>` component to render this:

```tsx filename="/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx" {9-11}
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignUp from '@clerk/elements/sign-up'

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <SignUp.Root>
      <SignUp.Step name="start">
        <h1>Create an account</h1>
      </SignUp.Step>
    </SignUp.Root>
  )
}
```

### Add form fields

Make it functional by adding fields. For the sake of this guide, let's assume that your instance is configured to require a username and allow authentication with email codes, as well as with Google. You'll use the Clerk Elements field components to render `identifier` and `username` fields, as well as the `<Connection>` component to render a button that allows users to sign up with Google.

```tsx filename="/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx" {12-28}
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignUp from '@clerk/elements/sign-up'

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <SignUp.Root>
      <SignUp.Step name="start">
        <h1>Create an account</h1>

        <Clerk.Connection name="google">
          Sign up with Google
        </Clerk.Connection>

        <Clerk.Field name="identifier">
          <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <Clerk.Field name="username">
          <Clerk.Label>Username</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <SignUp.Action submit>Sign up</SignUp.Action>
      </SignUp.Step>
    </SignUp.Root>
  )
}
```

`<Clerk.Field>` takes care of wiring up the input with the label element, and `<Clerk.FieldError>` will render any field-specific errors that get returned from the Clerk's API. You've also used the `<SignUp.Action>` component. This component provides common actions that are used throughout the flows. In this case, you're using the `submit` action to render a submit button for the start form.

### Accept additional fields

If a user now attempts to sign up via Google, but username is a required field, you'll need to render the `continue` step to accept the username. Use the `<SignUp.Step>` component to render additional required fields.

```tsx filename="/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx" {30-40}
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignUp from '@clerk/elements/sign-up'

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <SignUp.Root>
      <SignUp.Step name="start">
        <h1>Create an account</h1>

        <Clerk.Connection name="google">
          Sign up with Google
        </Clerk.Connection>

        <Clerk.Field name="identifier">
          <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <Clerk.Field name="username">
          <Clerk.Label>Username</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <SignUp.Action submit>Sign up</SignUp.Action>
      </SignUp.Step>
      <SignUp.Step name="continue">
        <h1>Fill in missing fields</h1>

        <Clerk.Field name="username">
          <Clerk.Label>Username</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <SignUp.Action submit>Continue</SignUp.Action>
      </SignUp.Step>
    </SignUp.Root>
  )
}
```

If your instance has additional required fields, you can add them the same way you added the `username` field to the continue step.

<Callout>
Under the hood, Clerk Elements will conditionally render the fields that are necessary to complete the sign up attempt, so there's no need to check the state of the sign up attempt yourself.
</Callout>

### Email and phone verification

Next up is email and phone verification. If your instance requires verification of either of these fields, you will need to render the verifications step. Inside of verifications, you can render the UI for each verification strategy. In this case, you'll render both the `email_code` and `phone_code` strategies.

```tsx filename="/app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx" {41-54}
'use client'

import * as Clerk from '@clerk/elements/common'
import * as SignUp from '@clerk/elements/sign-up'

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <SignUp.Root>
      <SignUp.Step name="start">
        <h1>Create an account</h1>

        <Clerk.Connection name="google">
          Sign up with Google
        </Clerk.Connection>

        <Clerk.Field name="identifier">
          <Clerk.Label>Email</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <Clerk.Field name="username">
          <Clerk.Label>Username</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <SignUp.Action submit>Sign up</SignUp.Action>
      </SignUp.Step>
      <SignUp.Step name="continue">
        <h1>Fill in missing fields</h1>

        <Clerk.Field name="username">
          <Clerk.Label>Username</Clerk.Label>
          <Clerk.Input />
          <Clerk.FieldError />
        </Clerk.Field>

        <SignUp.Action submit>Continue</SignUp.Action>
      </SignUp.Step>
      <SignUp.Step name="verifications">
        <SignUp.Strategy name="email_code">
          <h1>Check your email</h1>
          <p>We've sent a code to <SignUp.SafeIdentifier /></p>

          <Clerk.Field name="code">
            <Clerk.Label>Email Code</Clerk.Label>
            <Clerk.Input />
            <Clerk.FieldError />
          </Clerk.Field>

          <SignUp.Action submit>Verify</SignUp.Action>
        </SignUp.Strategy>
      </SignUp.Step>
    </SignUp.Root>
  )
}
```

Supporting phone verification requires a similar setup, replace `email_code` with `phone_code` when rendering the strategy.

### Customize and add styling

You might have noticed by now that none of components rendered so far come with their own styling. This is by design! With the exception of `<SignUp.Root>` and `<SignUp.Strategy>`, every component rendered so far can be styled. You can use the `className` prop to add custom classes to each component. Check out the [styling guide](/docs/elements/guides/styling) for a more in-depth guide on styling Clerk Elements.

If you're looking to customize the UI even further, check out additional Clerk Elements components like [`<Loading>`](/docs/elements/reference/common#loading) and [`<FieldState>`](/docs/elements/reference/common#fieldstate).
