# Email and SMS templates

Clerk provides a templating system that allows you to customize the default system email and SMS messages sent during authentication flows.

The template editor enables you to change the wording and styling so that it is more consistent with your own branding.

It is also a useful way to translate the content to another target language in the case that English is not the default locale of your application.

## Terminology

It will be useful to take a look at the following terms as they will reappear in the rest of the guide:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| template name | User-friendly name of the template. This will be visible on the template listing page. |
| variables | Also known as merge tags in the context of email marketing, these are placeholders that are replaced with dynamic data when the actual email or SMS is being sent to the recipient. |
| WYSIWYG | Stands for 'What You See Is What You Get.' This term is used for editors and design tools that allow you create content or layout in a visual manner (i.e. without requiring you to edit the underlying markup) so that you can instantly see how the result is going to display to your users. |
| blocks | Email WYSIWYG editors enable you to use blocks, rows, and columns in order to control the layout of their content (this is then transpiled to table-based HTML). |

## Available templates

Clerk allows you to modify the templates listed below.

### Email

To access the email templates, navigate to the [Emails](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=customization/email) tab under the **Customization** section in the Clerk Dashboard.

## Before you start 

### Revolvapp WYSIWYG email editor plugin

The email editor uses the [Revolvapp](https://imperavi.com/revolvapp) email template editor plugin by Imperavi. To acquaint yourself with the template markup syntax, please consult the corresponding [documentation page](https://imperavi.com/revolvapp/docs/syntax/quick-start).

As you will see, the template markup is an HTML-like language and each type of node supports its own set of attributes which control its behavior. A lot of the attributes are borrowed from HTML itself.

Revolvapp allows the user to design the template using blocks and under the hood transpiles its markup to table-based HTML so that the resulting email renders consistently across email clients.

### Handlebars templating language

Both the email and SMS editor use the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templating language for the interpolation of dynamic values into your content via variables. It is a well established language, especially popular in the Javascript ecosystem, which has been adopted by leading Email Service Providers (ESPs) for templating as well.

The most core Handlebars concept you should bear in mind is that in order to output a variable, you should wrap its name within double curly braces. For example: `{{app.name}}`. When the message is to be sent, this will be replaced with the actual name of the application.

Using the variable insertion widgets, the variables will be inserted into the content at the desired position, so there is no need to write them by hand. Though, you can still do so if you like.

For further information on Handlebars, we recommend you take a look at the [official guides](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/).

There will definitely be a learning curve before you master both Revolvapp syntax and Handlebars, but there's no doubt that you will be crafting beautiful templates in no time!

## Template operations

Please consult the following sub-sections to see which operations are available in the template editor.

<Callout type="info">
  Depending on the state of the template and the current application subscription plan, one or more operations may not not available.
</Callout>

### Edit 

Editing templates allows you to customize existing Clerk-sent emails and SMS messages to make them more inline with your own branding. To edit a template, click on the desired template card from the [Email](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=customization/email) or [SMS](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=customization/sms) template listing page.

To persist your changes, click on the **Apply Changes** button at the bottom right. Your changes will then take immediate effect for the corresponding application instance. 

Templates are editable:

- On the development instance of applications on any subscription plan (free or paid)
- On the staging and production instances of paid plans

This allows you freely test the templating feature on your development environment to see if it fits your individual use case before deciding on a plan upgrade.

### Preview 

The Preview operation enables you to get an idea of how the template will render when sent to the recipient. This is useful for sampling your changes without actually having to commit them first.

To trigger a preview, you can click on the **Preview** button at the bottom left of the screen. The example below shows a preview of the default **Invitation** email template.

<Images 
width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-sms-options/template-preview.jpg"
alt="A preview of the default 'Invitation' email template. A red arrow points to the 'Preview' button."
/>

In email templates, the `app_logo` and `copyright` sections (if present) will be replaced with their actual markup in this view. For both emails & SMS, the template variables will be replaced with sample values.

Previewing is available for all templates.

### Reset 

While editing a template, you can undo all changes since the last save by clicking on the **Reset** button at the bottom right of the edit page.

Template reset is applicable to editable templates.

<Images 
width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-sms-options/reset-template.jpg"
alt="The 'Invitation' email template customization page. A red arrow points to the 'Reset' button."
/>

### Revert

Even if you override a Clerk-provided template with your own customizations, you can always roll back to the system default template version by clicking on the **Revert** button.

<Images 
width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-sms-options/revert-template.jpg"
alt="The 'Invitation' email template customization page. A red arrow points to the 'Revert' button."
/>

This can be useful if you want to start over from scratch.

<Callout type="info">
  Your current changes will be lost, so please make sure you indeed wish to discard them prior to reverting. You will be asked to confirm your choice to prevent an unintentional action.
</Callout>

### Copy to another instance of the same application

If your application has more than one instance, then you will also have the option of copying the current state of the editor to another instance.

This is especially useful for promoting changes from your development or staging environment to production, after you have tested them.

To copy to another instance, you will need to first click on the **Copy to** button and then from the sub-menu, select the target instance.

<Callout type="warning">
  The copy icon will not appear if there are no other instances available on your application.
</Callout>

<Images

height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-sms-options/copy-button.jpg"
alt="The 'Invitation' email template customization page. A red arrow points to the 'Copy' button."
/>

Since this change will override the current state of the template on the target instance, you will be asked to confirm your choice.

## Email template editor 

The email template editor comprises of template settings & the WYSIWYG editor.

The WYSIWYG editor is split into two parts:

- The toolbar
- The text area

Since the toolbar exposes quite a few tools, we will examine them in more detail in the following sub-sections.

<Images 
width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-sms-options/WYSIWYG-editor.jpg"
alt="The 'WYSIWG' editor with a red box around the toolbar and a red box around the text area. Both sections are labeled accordingly."
/>

### Template settings

The following settings can be changed for an email template:

#### Delivered by Clerk

Out of the box, Clerk will deliver your emails using its own Email Service Provider (ESP), which is currently [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/). However, if you wish to handle delivery of emails on your own, then you can toggle **Delivered by Clerk** off.

This means that Clerk will no longer be sending this particular email and in order to deliver it yourself, you will need to listen to the `emails.created` webhook and extract the necessary info from the event payload.

<Callout type="info">
  This is a per-template setting.
</Callout>

height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-sms-options/delivered-by-clerk.jpg"
alt="The 'Invitation' email template customization page. There is a red box around the 'Delivered by Clerk' section."
/>

#### Template name

The template name is a human-friendly name for identifying the template on the template listing page. It does not affect the outgoing email in any way.

<Images 
width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-sms-options/template-name.jpg"
alt="The 'Invitation' email template customization page. There is a red box around the 'Name' section."
/>

#### Send from

Clerk will populate the 'from' email address with:

`<local part>@<your-domain>`

The local part depends on the type of email sent ('verification code', 'invitation', etc).

If you wish to override the local part with your own value, e.g. 'accounting', 'sales', etc, then set that value in the provided input.

width={3024}
height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-sms-options/template-from.jpg"
alt="The 'Invitation' email template customization page. There is a red box around the 'Send from' section."
/>

### Toolbar controls

Note that the toolbar contains two types of controls:

1. Buttons - expose a sub-menu with more settings you can apply to the currently selected block or text; you can switch from one button to another with a single click.
2. Toggles - switch the editor to another view mode, in which all other tools become disabled. To exit the current mode, you will need to toggle back.

#### Shortcuts button

Opens a popup with the keyboard shortcuts that the editor supports.

/>

#### HTML mode toggle

Switches the editor to source mode. The source format is Revolvapp's own template syntax, which is HTML-like and transpiles to HTML that can be rendered by browsers and email clients.

For this tool to appear, you will need to unselect any currently selected block.

To exit HTML/source mode, click on the toggle again.

### How to make buttons & links inherit your theme colors

As you may have noticed, the links and buttons in the Clerk-provided templates automatically show in the colors selected in the **Customization > Theme** section. Specifically:

The color of buttons and links in your emails maps to the primary color set in your theme
The font color of buttons in your emails maps to the button text color set in your theme
Since you may not want all buttons or links to have this behavior, you will need to opt in by using the following classes:

- `cl-branded-button` - for buttons
- `cl-branded-link` - for links

These classes can be added as attributes to the Revolvapp template markup after toggling the editor to HTML (i.e. source) mode.

<Images

height={1652}
src="/docs/images/authentication/email-sms-options/cl-branded-button-class.jpg"
alt="The 'Invitation' email template customization page. The 'email body' WSYIWG editor is toggled to HTML mode. There is a red arrow pointing to the 'cl-branded-button' class."
/>

### Text area controls

The email editor text area is intended mainly for authoring content. Though, if you click on a block, a set of tools will also appear:

- Move handle - Allows the selected block to be moved up or down with regard to its sibling blocks
- Delete - Removes the block from the template
- Clone - Clones the block using the exact same settings

alt="The 'Invitation' email template customization page. The 'Accept invitation' button has been clicked, revealing a small toolbar. There is a red box around the toolbar with a red arrow pointing to it."
/>

## SMS template editor

The SMS editor is much simpler to use since SMS supports plain text only. You can edit the message contents to your liking via the provided text area. You can also set up template settings according to your needs.

When you are satisfied with your edits you can persist them by clicking on the **Apply Changes** button.

### Template settings

The following settings can be changed for an SMS template:

#### Delivered by Clerk

Out of the box, Clerk will deliver your SMS messagess using its own SMS Gateway. However, if you wish to handle SMS delivery on your own, then you can toggle delivery by Clerk off.

This means that Clerk will no longer be sending this particular SMS and in order to deliver it yourself you will need to listen to the `sms.created` webhook and extract the necessary info from the event payload.

<Callout type="info">
  This is a per-template setting.

#### Template name

The template name is a human-friendly name for identifying the template on the template listing page. It does not affect the outgoing SMS message in any way.

/>

#### Variable widget

To insert a variable at the current cursor position, you can click on the corresponding variable badge in the variable widget that is located adjacent to the text area.

Note that the invitation template supports public invitation metadata, whereas the verification code template supports public user metadata (in the case that a user already exists).

You can interpolate a particular metadata key as follows:

`{{invitation.public_metadata.foo.bar}}`
