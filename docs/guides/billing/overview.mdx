## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### Can I use an existing Stripe account with Clerk billing?

Unfortunately, there is no way to use an existing business entity with Clerk billing.

### Can I see subscriptions in my Stripe account?

Clerk billing does not use Stripe products, prices, subscriptions, etc. Clerk manages plans and subscriptions/subscription items, and only uses Stripe for payment processing. You will still be able to see customer information, as well as payment information in your Stripe account.

### Is Clerk a Merchant of Record (MoR) for transactions?

No, Clerk does not provide this service.

### Is Clerk billing supported in all countries?

Clerk Billing is not supported in Brazil, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, and Thailand due to [payment processing restrictions](https://stripe.com/en-th/legal/restricted-businesses) when using Stripe as the payment processor. This limitation applies to the location of your business, not the country of the end customer who is paying. For more details, see [Stripe's list of supported countries](https://stripe.com/global).

### Does Clerk Billing support non-USD currencies?

No, only USD is supported currently.
