Testing is an important part of every application. Clerk has built some helpers to make testing your application with Clerk easier, with more on the way. Each framework may require a slightly different setup. If you're having trouble getting testing to work properly, [send us a message](https://clerk.com/support) and we'll be able to help.

## Testing with one time passcodes

To avoid sending an email or SMS message with a one time passcode (OTP) during testing, you can use a faux email address or phone number that has a fixed code. Read the complete documentation [here](https://clerk.com/docs/testing/test-emails-and-phones).

## End-to-end (E2E) testing

Currently, end-to-end testing is not fully supported with Clerk due to tests getting detected as bot traffic. We are currently working on a solution for this.
