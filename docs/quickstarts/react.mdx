</TutorialHero>

<Steps>
  ### Create a React app using Vite

  Run the following commands to create a new React app using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project):

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm create vite@latest clerk-react -- --template react-ts
    cd clerk-react
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn create vite clerk-react --template react-ts
    cd clerk-react
    yarn install
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm create vite clerk-react --template react-ts
    cd clerk-react
    pnpm install
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Install `@clerk/clerk-react`

  Clerk's [React SDK](/docs/references/react/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn",  "pnpm" ]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/clerk-react
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/clerk-react
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/clerk-react
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add your Clerk publishable key to your `.env.local` file. It can always be retrieved from the [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API Keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable key.
    1. Paste your key into your `.env.local` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env.local' }}
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  ```

  ### Import the Clerk publishable key

  In your `main.tsx` file, import your Clerk publishable key. You can add an `if` statement to check that it is imported and that it exists. This will prevent running the app without the publishable key, and will also prevent TypeScript errors.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [[6, 7], [9, 11]] }}
  import React from 'react'
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
  import App from './App.tsx'
  import './index.css'

  // Import your publishable key
  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
    throw new Error('Add your Clerk publishable key to the .env.local file')
  }

  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

  ### Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your app

  The [`<ClerkProvider>`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component wraps your app to provide active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components. You must pass your publishable key as a prop to the `<ClerkProvider>` component.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [5, 16, 18] }}
  import React from 'react'
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
  import App from './App.tsx'
  import './index.css'
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

  // Import your publishable key
  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
    throw new Error('Add your Clerk publishable key to the .env.local file')
  }

  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY} afterSignOutUrl="/">
        <App />
      </ClerkProvider>
    </React.StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

  ### Create a header with Clerk components

  You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/components/overview#what-are-control-components). Create a header using the following components:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button): Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page or displays the sign-in modal.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/App.tsx', mark: [1, [6, 11]] }}
  import { SignedIn, SignedOut, SignInButton, UserButton } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

  export default function App() {
    return (
      <header>
        <SignedOut>
          <SignInButton />
        </SignedOut>
        <SignedIn>
          <UserButton />
        </SignedIn>
      </header>
    )
  }
  ```

  ### Create your first user

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your app's homepage at [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173). Sign up to create your first user.

## Next step: Add routing with React Router

React has many options for handling routing, and you are free to choose the option that suits you best. If you would like to learn how to integrate React Router's latest Data API-based router (also known as Data Router), see [the dedicated guide.](/docs/references/react/add-react-router)
