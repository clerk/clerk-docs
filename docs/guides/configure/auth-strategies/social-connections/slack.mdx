Enabling OAuth with [Slack](https://api.slack.com/authentication) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Slack account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Slack**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Slack's API Platform](https://api.slack.com/).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Slack as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Slack**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URL** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create a Slack app

  1. In the Slack API Platform, navigate to the [**Your Apps**](https://api.slack.com/apps) page and select **Create New App**.
  1. The **Create an app** modal will open. Depending on your app needs, select either **From a manifest** or **From scratch**. For more information on which to choose, refer to [Slack's doc on manifests](https://api.slack.com/reference/manifests).
  1. After following the respective steps for either option, you'll be redirected to the **App Credentials** page. Save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** somewhere secure. Keep this page open.
  1. In the sidenav, navigate to the **OAuth & Permissions** page.
  1. Scroll down to the **Redirect URLs** section and select **Add New Redirect URL**. Paste the **Redirect URL** you saved from the Clerk Dashboard. Select **Add**, then select **Save URLs**.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ### Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/test-your-connection" />
