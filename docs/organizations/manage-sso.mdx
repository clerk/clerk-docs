title: Organization-level SSO
---

TODO:
- Explain how to add organization-level enterprise connections on the Dashboard
- Include onboarding flows, such as:
  - **Organization created first from Clerk Dashboard**:
    - App owner creates an organization for their customer via Dashboard
    - App owner syncs with their customer’s IT admin to get the necessary info to set up the SSO connection via Dashboard
    - App owner invites their customer's users to that organization, which can then perform SSO
  - **User Signs Up First with Organization, and SSO connection gets created later**:
    1. End user signs up to try out a Clerk customer’s product for their company. They start with a individual account only.
    2. They decide to go with the product and create an organization for their company.
    3. App owner goes to Clerk Dashboard and configures SSO for that organization
    4. Users can now perform enterprise SSO
- Clarify that SSO is enforced by domain. For instance, you can create a SSO connection for one domain within an organization while adding a verified domain to invite external contributors, such as contractors.
