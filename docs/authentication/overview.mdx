# Sign-up & Sign-in

## Configuration

Clerk's configuration settings affect how the users of your application can sign up and sign in and which attributes are editable via their user profile. You can find these settings under the **User & Authentication** section in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/).

Check out our detailed guide for information on [how to set up your application](/docs/authentication/set-up-your-application).

## Custom Flows

Clerk provides the flexibility to create [custom sign-up and sign-in flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview) for your application. Below are some of the most common flows that you can implement with Clerk.

[Email & Password](/docs/custom-flows/email-password)

With this setup, users that come to your website will need to supply an authorized email and password to gain access to their account.

[Email / SMS OTP](/docs/custom-flows/email-sms-otp)

During sign-in, users will enter their identifier (email address or phone number) to receive a one-time code and complete the authentication process.

[Magic Links](/docs/custom-flows/magic-links)

During login or registration, users will enter their email address to receive an email message with a link that can be clicked and complete the authentication process.

[Multifactor](/docs/custom-flows/mfa)

By enabling multifactor authentication (MFA), often referred to as two-factor authentication or 2FA, you can encourage or require your users to perform a second verification check during sign-in.

[Social Login Providers](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview)

Clerk offers a list of Social Login providers that can be used during sign-up and sign-in. There will be a button on the sign-in and sign-up pages with the provider's logo and the appropriate text for each of the selected providers.

Don't see the provider you need? Request others [here](https://clerk.com/support); we can usually add them within a week.
