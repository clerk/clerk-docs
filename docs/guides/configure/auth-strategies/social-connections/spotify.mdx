Enabling OAuth with [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Spotify account.

> [!CAUTION]
> For **development** instances, [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes) requires users to be added to the app's allowlist in order to use Spotify as a social provider in your Clerk app. If they are not allowlisted, any API requests made with an [access token](!access-token) associated with that user and the Spotify app will receive a 403 status code.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/).

<Steps>
  ## Enable Spotify as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Spotify**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ## Create a Spotify app

  1. In the top-right of the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/), select **Create app**.
  1. Complete the required fields. For **Redirect URIs**, paste the **Redirect URI** that you saved from Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Save**. You'll be redirected to your app's **All Stats** page.
  1. Select **Settings**.
  1. Save the **Client ID** and **Client secret** somewhere secure. To get the **Client secret**, select **View client secret**.

  ## Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ## Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/test-your-connection" />
</Steps>
