# Web support

Expo provides a way to [develop web applications](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/web/) using the same codebase as your iOS and Android apps. Though Clerk prebuilt components cannot be used in native apps, they can be used in web applications built with Expo.

## Create a new project with web support

If you're starting from scratch, you can follow the [Expo quickstart](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/expo), which showcases how to create a sign-in and sign-up page with the same code for all platforms Expo supports.

## Add web support to an existing project

If you already have an Expo project and want to add web support, you must first ensure that your existing Clerk [custom flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview) do not have any native-specific code. If you have any native-specific code you will have to either adjust your custom flows to also work on web by leveraging [platform-specific code](https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code#platform-specific-extensions), if you are using Expo Router you can also take a look at the [platform-specific modules](https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/platform-specific-modules/) guide.

> [!WARNING]
> Clerk prebuilt components are only available on the web platform. If you're using Expo for iOS or Android, you'll need to build components using [custom flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview).
