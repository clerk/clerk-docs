Clerk supports a layered approach to UI customization. The different customization layers allow you to customize something as simple as colors and variables, to building a totally custom UI using Clerk's headless APIs. Use this guide to help you pick the customization layer that works for your application.

## Customization layers

### Variables

[Variables](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/variables) allow you to customize the colors and basic design tokens of Clerk's prebuilt components. If you are happy with Clerk's prebuilt components and are only looking to make minimal tweaks, start with Variables.

### Themes

Clerk's prebuilt components are controlled by the [`appearance` prop](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/overview). In addition to Variables, the `appearance` prop also supports defining custom CSS rules for underlying DOM elements under `appearance.elements`. These values can be bundled into a standalone theme and shared with others. Clerk provides a number of prebuilt themes, including a shadcn theme to make Clerk's prebuilt components match your shadcn styling. Use themes if you need to share styling across teams or applications, or if one of Clerk's prebuilt themes matches your brand.

### Bring your own CSS

Clerk assigns a stable CSS class to most elements in the markup, allowing you to style elements from your own stylesheet, or by using `appearance.elements` to assign additional classes and styles via JavaScript. To make overriding the style of Clerk's prebuilt components easier, a `simple` theme is also provided out of the box. To totally control styling of Clerk's prebuilt components, use the `simple` theme in conjunction with custom CSS. To learn more about bringing your own CSS, see the [Bring your own CSS](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/bring-your-own-css) docs.

### Headless APIs

Clerk exposes the underlying APIs and methods that are used to build the prebuilt components if your needs require a fully custom UI implementation. While it is recommended to use the prebuilt components to receive continual updates and reduce maintenance overhead, the headless APIs and accompanying [guides](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview) will help you implement UIs on top of Clerk's APIs.

## Customizing with the `appearance` prop

The `appearance` prop controls customization of Clerk's prebuilt components. The prop can be provided to both the `<ClerkProvider>` as well as any of Clerk's components. The value of the `appearance` prop is also the basis of a [Clerk Theme](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/themes).

## Shadcn integration

[Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) is a set of pre-designed components that can be pulled into your application and serve as a basis for your application's component library.

To support applications using shadcn, Clerk ships a dedicated [`shadcn` theme](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/themes#shadcn-theme) that maps shadcn variables to Clerk's own variables.
