To learn how to customize Clerk iOS components, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/references/ios/clerk-theme).

If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).
