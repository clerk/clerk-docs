## Configure LinkedIn connection for your development instance

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for *development instances* - no other configuration is needed. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard and go to **User & Authentication -> [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)**. From the list of OAuth vendors, scroll to find the LinkedIn option. Toggle it on and click **Save**.

## Configure LinkedIn connection for your production instance

In *production instances*, you must provide custom credentials, which includes generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your LinkedIn Developer account. Don't worry, this tutorial will walk you through that process in just a few steps.

<Steps>

### Create a LinkedIn application

To create a new OAuth LinkedIn app, go to the [LinkedIn Developer portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/) and click on the **Create app** button.

Once redirected to the application creation form, you need to set a name, associate a LinkedIn page with it, and upload a logo for your new application.

### Enable LinkedIn as a social connection

To enable LinkedIn as a social connection for your Clerk application, go to the Clerk Dashboard. Navigate to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)**. From the list of OAuth vendors, toggle on the LinkedIn option.

  alt="The 'Social connections' page in the Clerk Dashboard. An arrow is pointing to the LinkedIn toggle."
/>

In the modal that opened, copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Keep this modal and page open.

### Set the Authorized Redirect URI for your LinkedIn application

Navigate back to the LinkedIn Developer portal and go to the **Auth** tab.

Scroll to the **OAuth 2.0 settings** section. In the **Authorized redirect URLs for your app** input, paste the **Authorized Redirect URI** value you copied from the Clerk Dashboard in the last step.

### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

In the LinkedIn Developer portal, navigate to the **Application credentials** section and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

  alt="The 'Auth' tab in the Linkedin Developer dashboard for a user's application. There are arrows pointing to the 'Client ID' and 'Client Secret' values."

Go back to the Clerk Dashboard, where the modal should still be open, and paste these values into the respective fields.

  If the modal or page is not still open, go to the Clerk Dashboard and navigate to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)**. Click on the settings cog icon next to the LinkedIn option. You can now paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.

### Enable OpenID Connect in your LinkedIn application

In the LinkedIn Developer portal for your application, go to the **Products** tab. Enable the **Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect** product for your OAuth application.

<Callout type="info">
  If you need to ensure the longevity of the user's access token without the need for re-authentication, make sure to obtain approval as a [Marketing Developer Platform (MDP) partner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/quick-start?view=li-lms-2023-10#step-1-apply-for-api-access). This is not required if you don't directly interact with the LinkedIn API using the access token.
