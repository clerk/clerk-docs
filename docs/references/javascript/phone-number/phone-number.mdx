# `PhoneNumber`

The `PhoneNumber` object describes a phone number. Phone numbers can be used as a proof of identification for users, or simply as a means of contacting users.

Phone numbers must be verified to ensure that they can be assigned to their rightful owners. The `PhoneNumber` object holds all the necessary state around the verification process.

The verification process always starts with the [`PhoneNumber.prepareVerification()`](/docs/references/javascript/phone-number/verification#prepare-verification) method, which will send a one-time verification code via an SMS message. The second and final step involves an attempt to complete the verification by calling the [`PhoneNumber.attemptVerification()`](/docs/references/javascript/phone-number/verification#attempt-verification) method, passing the one-time code as a parameter.

Finally, phone numbers are used as part of [multi-factor authentication](/docs/custom-flows/mfa). Users receive an SMS message with a one-time code that they need to provide as an extra verification step.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | A unique identifier for this phone number. |
| `phoneNumber` | `string` | The value of this phone number, in [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164). |
| `reservedForSecondFactor` | `boolean` | Set to `true` if this phone number is reserved for multi-factor authentication (2FA). Set to `false` otherwise. |
| `defaultSecondFactor` | `boolean` | Set to `true` if this phone number is the default second factor. Set to `false` otherwise. A user must have exactly one default second factor, if multi-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled. |
| `verification` | [`Verification`](/docs/references/javascript/verification) | An object holding information on the verification of this phone number. |
| `linkedTo` | `Array<{id: string, type: string}>` | An object containing information about any other identification that might be linked to this phone number. |
| `backupCodes` | `string[] | undefined` | A list of backup codes in case of lost phone number access. |
