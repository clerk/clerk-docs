# Build your own sign-in and sign-up pages for your Next.js app with Clerk

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) and [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) components with the [Next.js optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments) in order to build custom sign-in and sign-up pages for your Next.js app.

If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, check out the [custom flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview) guides.

<Steps>
  ### Build a sign-up page

  Create a new file that will be used to render the sign-up page. In the file, import the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component from `@clerk/nextjs` and render it.

  <CodeBlockTabs type="router" options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'app/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx' }}
    import { SignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export default function Page() {
      return <SignUp />;
    }
    ```

    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: '/pages/sign-up/[[...index]].tsx' }}
    import { SignUp } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export default function Page() {
      return <SignUp />;
    }
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Build a sign-in page

  Create a new file that will be used to render the sign-in page. In the file, import the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component from `@clerk/nextjs` and render it.

  <CodeBlockTabs type="router" options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx' }}
    import { SignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export default function Page() {
      return <SignIn />;
    }
    ```

    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: '/pages/sign-in/[[...index]].tsx' }}
    import { SignIn } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export default function Page() {
      return <SignIn />;
    }
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Update your environment variables

  In the previous steps, a `path` prop is passed to the `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` components. This is because the components need to know which route they are originally mounted on.

  In Next.js applications, you can either pass the `path` prop, _or_ you can define the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` environment variables, like so:

  ```env {{ prettier: false, filename: '.env.local' }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
  ```

  ### Visit your new pages

  Run your project with the following terminal command from the root directory of your project:

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ prettier: false, filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom pages locally at [localhost:3000/sign-in](http://localhost:3000/sign-in) and [localhost:3000/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/sign-up).
