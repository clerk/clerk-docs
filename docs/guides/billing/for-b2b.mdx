Clerk billing for B2B SaaS allows you to create plans and manage subscriptions **for companies or organizations** in your application. If you'd like to charge individual users, see [Billing for B2C SaaS](/docs/guides/billing/for-b2c). You can also combine both B2C and B2B billing in the same application.

## Create a plan

Subscription plans are what your customers subscribe to. There is no limit to the number of plans you can create. If your Clerk instance has existing [custom permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/roles-and-permissions), the corresponding features from those permissions will automatically be added to the free plan for orgs. This ensures that organization members get the same set of custom permissions when billing is enabled, because all organizations start on the free plan.

To create a plan, navigate to the [**Plans**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/plans) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Here, you can create, edit, and delete plans. To setup B2B billing, select the **Plans for Organizations** tab and select **Add Plan**. When creating a plan, you can also create [features](/docs/guides/secure/features) for the plan; see the next section for more information.

> Plans appear in some Clerk components depending on what kind of plan it is. All plans can appear in the `<PricingTable />` component. If it's an organization plan, it can appear in the `<OrganizationProfile />` component. When creating or editing a plan, if you'd like to hide it from appearing in Clerk components, you can toggle the **Publicly available** option off.

## Add features to a plan

[Features](/docs/guides/secure/features) make it easy to give entitlements to your plans. You can add any number of features to a plan.

You can add a feature to a plan when you are creating a plan. To add it after a plan is created:

1. Navigate to the [**Plans**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/plans) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
1. Select the plan you'd like to add a feature to.
1. In the **Features** section, select **Add Feature**.

## Create a pricing page

You can create a pricing page by using the [`<PricingTable />`](/docs/reference/components/billing/pricing-table) component. This component displays a table of plans and features that customers can subscribe to. **It's recommended to create a dedicated page**, as shown in the following example.

<Include src="_partials/billing/create-an-organization-pricing-table" />

## Control access with features, plans, and permissions

You can use Clerk's features, plans, and permissions to gate access to content using [authorization checks](!authorization-check). There are a few ways to do this, but the recommended approach is to either use the [`has()`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#has) method or the [`<Protect>`](/docs/reference/components/control/protect) component.

The `has()` method is available for any JavaScript-based framework, while `<Protect>` is a component, and therefore, is only available for React-based frameworks.

### Example: Using `has()`

Use the `has()` method to test if the organization has access to a **plan**:

```jsx
const hasPremiumAccess = has({ plan: 'gold' })
```

Or a **feature**:

```jsx
const hasPremiumAccess = has({ feature: 'widgets' })
```

The [`has()`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#has) method is a server-side helper that checks if the organization has been granted a specific type of access control (role, permission, feature, or plan) and returns a boolean value. `has()` is available on the [`auth` object](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object), which you will access differently [depending on the framework you are using](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#how-to-access-the-auth-object).

### Example: Using `<Protect>`

The [`<Protect>`](/docs/reference/components/control/protect) component protects content or even entire routes by checking if the organization has been granted a specific type of access control (role, permission, feature, or plan). You can pass a `fallback` prop to `<Protect>` that will be rendered if the organization does not have the access control.
