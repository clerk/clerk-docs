# Email Verificaiton

Test

## `prepareEmailAddressVerification()`

```typescript
function prepareEmailAddressVerification(params?: PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<SignUp>;
```

Helper method that allows you to initiate a verification process for an email address. It basically sends a one-time code to the email address already supplied to the current sign up.

This is equivalent to calling `SignUp.prepareVerification("email_code")`.

## `attemptEmailAddressVerification()`

```typescript
function attemptEmailAddressVerification(params: AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<SignUp>;
```

Helper method that attempts to complete the verification process for an email address. It basically verifies that the supplied code is the same as the one-time code that was sent to the email address during the prepare verification phase.

This is equivalent to calling `SignUp.attemptVerification({strategy: "email_code", ...params})`.
