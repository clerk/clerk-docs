# `useAuth()`

The `useAuth()` hook is a convenient way to access the current auth state. This hook provides the minimal information needed for data-loading and helper methods to manage the current active session.

## `useAuth()` returns

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `isSignedIn` | `boolean` | A boolean that returns true if the user is signed in. |
| `isLoaded` | `boolean` | A boolean that until Clerk loads and initializes, will be set to `false`. Once Clerk loads, `isLoaded` will be set to `true`. |
| `userId` | `string` | The current user's ID. |
| `sessionId` | `string` | The current user's session ID. |
| `orgId` | `string` | The current user's active organization ID. |
| `orgRole` | `string` | The current user's active organization role. |
| `orgSlug` | `string` | The current user's organization slug. |
| `signOut()` | `(options?: SignOutOptions) => Promise<void>` | A function that signs the user out. See the [reference documentation](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk#sign-out) for more information. |
| `getToken()` | `(options?: GetTokenOptions) => Promise\<string \| null\>` | A function that returns a promise that resolves to the current user's session token. Can also be used to retrieve a custom JWT template. See the [reference documentation](/docs/references/javascript/session#get-token) for more information. |
| `has()` | `(isAuthorizedParams: CheckAuthorizationParamsWithCustomPermissions) => boolean` | A function that returns a boolean based on the permission or role provided as parameter. Can be used for authorization. See the [reference documentation](https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#has) for more information. |

## How to use the `useAuth()` hook

The following example demonstrates how to use the `useAuth()` hook to access the current auth state, like whether the user is signed in or not. It also demonstrates a basic example of how you could use the `getToken()` method to retrieve a session token for fetching data from an external resource.

```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'external-data-page.tsx' }}
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

export default function ExternalDataPage() {
  const { getToken, isLoaded, isSignedIn } = useAuth();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state however you like
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (!isSignedIn) {
    // Handle signed out state however you like
    return <div>Sign in to view this page</div>;
  }

  const fetchDataFromExternalResource = async () => {
    const token = await getToken();
    // Add logic to fetch your data
    return data;
  }

  return <div>...</div>;
}
```
