description: Add web support to your Expo project with Clerk.

# Expo web support

Expo provides a way to [develop web applications](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/web/) using the same codebase as your iOS and Android apps. Clerk supports web applications built with Expo, allowing you to use Clerk's prebuilt components to add authentication and user management to your web app.

## Creating a new project with web support

If you're starting from scratch, you can follow the [Expo quickstart](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/expo), which directs you to create custom flows that can be used on all platforms out of the box.

## Adding web support to an existing project

If you already have an Expo project and want to add web support, you must first ensure that your Clerk custom flows do not use any native-specific code. If you have any native-specific code, in your custom flows, you will need to adjust it to work on the web, otherwise you will have to create a new custom flow specifically for the web or use the [prebuilt UI components](http://localhost:3000/docs/components/overview).

## Use prebuilt components on web

<Callout type="warning">
Clerk prebuilt components are only available on the web platform. If you're using Expo for iOS or Android, you'll need to build your components using [custom flows](https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/overview).

### Build sign in and sign up pages with prebuilt components on web

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) and [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) components in order to build custom sign-in and sign-up pages for your Expo web app.

<Steps>

### Build a sign-up page

Create a new file `sign-up.web.tsx` that will be used to render the sign-up page. In the file, import the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component from `@clerk/clerk-expo/web` and render it.

```tsx filename="/app/sign-up.web.tsx"
import { SignUp } from "@clerk/clerk-expo/web";

export default function Page() {
  return <SignUp />;
}
```

### Build a sign-in page

Create a new file `sign-in.web.tsx` that will be used to render the sign-in page. In the file, import the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component from `@clerk/clerk-expo/web` and render it.


```tsx filename="/app/sign-in.web.tsx"
import { SignIn } from "@clerk/clerk-expo/web";

export default function Page() {
  return <SignIn />;
}
```

### Visit your new pages

Run your project with the following terminal command from the root directory of your project:

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash filename="terminal"
    npm run web
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    yarn web
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    pnpm web
    ```

  </CodeBlockTabs>

Visit your new custom pages locally at [localhost:8081/sign-in](http://localhost:8081/sign-in) and [localhost:8081/sign-up](http://localhost:8081/sign-up).
