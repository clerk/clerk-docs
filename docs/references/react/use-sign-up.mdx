The `useSignUp()` hook gives you access to the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-up. This is also useful for creating a [custom sign-up flow.](#create-a-custom-sign-up-flow-with-use-sign-up)

## `useSignUp()` returns

<Properties>
  - `isLoaded`
  - `boolean`

  A boolean that is set to `false` until Clerk loads and initializes.

  ---

  - `setActive()`
  - <code>(params: [SetActiveParams](#set-active-params)) => Promise\<void></code>

  A function that sets the active session.

  ---

  - `signUp`
  - [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up)

  An object that contains the current sign-up attempt status and methods to create a new sign-up attempt.
</Properties>

### `SetActiveParams`

<Properties>
  - `session`
  - <code>[Session](/docs/references/javascript/session) | string | null</code>

  The session resource or session ID (string version) to be set as active. If `null`, the current session is deleted.

  ---

  - `organization`
  - <code>[Organization](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) | string | null</code>

  The organization resource or organization ID/slug (string version) to be set as active in the current session. If `null`, the currently active organization is removed as active.

  ---

  - `beforeEmit?`
  - `(session?: Session | null) => void | Promise<any>`

  Callback run just before the active session and/or organization is set to the passed object. Can be used to hook up for pre-navigation actions.
</Properties>

## How to use the `useSignUp()` hook

### Check the current state of a sign-up with `useSignUp()`

Use the `useSignUp()` hook to access the `SignUp` object and check the current state of a sign-up.

```tsx {{ filename: 'sign-up-step.tsx' }}
import { useSignUp } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

export default function SignUpStep() {
  const { isLoaded, signUp } = useSignUp()

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Add logic to handle loading state
    return null
  }

  return <div>The current sign-up attempt status is {signUp.status}.</div>
}
```

The `status` property of the `SignUp` object can be one of the following values:

| Values | Description |
| - | - |
| `complete` | The user has been created and custom flow can proceed to `setActive()` to create session. |
| `abandoned` | The sign-up attempt will be abandoned if it was started more than 24 hours previously. |
| `missing_requirements` | A requirement from the [Email, Phone, Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) settings is missing. For example, in the Clerk Dashboard, the Password setting is required but a password was not provided in the custom flow. |

### Create a custom sign-up flow with `useSignUp()`

The `useSignUp()` hook can also be used to build fully custom sign-up flows, if Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow. Different sign-up flows include email and password, email and phone codes, email links, and multifactor (MFA). To learn more about using the `useSignUp()` hook to create custom flows, check out the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).
