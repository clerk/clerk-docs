This guide will teach you how to add native [Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/) to your Clerk apps on Apple platforms.

> [!NOTE]
> Apple Sign-In works on both iOS Simulators and physical devices. However, physical devices provide full functionality including biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID), while simulators have limited support. Always test on a physical device before releasing to production.

<Steps>
  ## Add your Native Application

  Add your iOS application to the [**Native applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/native-applications) page in the Clerk Dashboard. You will need your iOS app's **App ID Prefix** and **Bundle ID**.

  ## Enable Apple as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. Select **Apple** from the provider list.
  1. Ensure that **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** is toggled on.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Apple provides a privacy feature called [Hide My Email](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425#hideemail), allowing users to sign in to your app with Apple without disclosing their actual email addresses. Instead, your instance receives an app-specific email address that forwards any emails to the user's real address. To be able to send emails properly to users with hidden addresses, you must configure an additional setting in the Apple Developer portal. See [Configure Email Source for Apple Private Relay](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/social-connections/apple#configure-email-source-for-apple-private-relay){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.

  ## Add the Sign in with Apple capability to your app

  [Add the Sign in with Apple capability to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-sign-in-with-apple#Add-the-Sign-in-with-Apple-capability-to-your-app).

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you are using Clerk's prebuilt components, you don't need to do anything else and can stop here. The `SignInWithApple` button will appear in your `AuthView` automatically.
  > If you are building a [custom flow](!custom-flow), continue to follow the steps below.

  ## Build your sign-in flow

  Use `clerk.auth.signInWithApple()` to start the native Sign in with Apple flow:

  ```swift
  try await clerk.auth.signInWithApple()
  ```
</Steps>
