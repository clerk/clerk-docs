description: Write end to end tests by simulating OTP verifications.

Most of Clerk's sign-in and sign-up flows involve verifying ownership of an email address or phone number via a [one-time password (OTP)](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-sms-otp). To confirm that your integration works correctly, you can simulate verification flows without sending an email or SMS, by using reserved values in test mode.

Verification messages are used during sign-up, sign-in, and when adding an email address or phone number to an existing account.

## Limitations

If Clerk is used to deliver SMS messages and/or emails for your development instance, a maximum of 20 SMS messages and 100 emails can be delivered per calendar month.

After that, requests resulting in SMS and/or email [OTPs](!otp) will be rejected. Other SMS or email notifications will still produce a webhook but won't be sent to the target address.

The following cases do not count toward the limit:

- SMS messages sent to US numbers
- SMS messages or emails sent to test numbers/addresses
- Self-delivered SMS messages or emails (i.e. not delivered by Clerk)
- SMS messages or emails for apps with a paid subscription

If your development instance requires a higher allowance of monthly SMS messages or emails, contact support to request a limit increase.

## Setup test mode

Every development instance has "test mode" enabled by default. If you need to use "test mode" on a production instance, you can enable it via the Clerk Dashboard or via the Backend API.

> [!WARNING]
> You should not be using "test mode" on any instance that manages actual customers.

### Test mode via the Clerk Dashboard

To enable test mode via the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the **Settings** page in the Clerk Dashboard. In the **Enable test mode** section, ensure the toggle is toggled on.

![The 'Enable test mode' section of the Settings page in the Clerk Dashboard. There is a red arrow pointing to the toggled, which is toggled on](/docs/images/testing/enable-test-mode.webp)

## How to use test mode

Once test mode is enabled, all you need to do is use the following test numbers as part of your standard flow.

### Email addresses

Any email with the `+clerk_test` subaddress is a test email address. No emails will be sent, and they can be verified with the code `424242`.

For example:

`jane+clerk_test@example.com`

`doe+clerk_test@example.com`

### Phone numbers

Any [fictional phone number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_\(telephone_number\)) is a test phone number. No SMS will be sent, and they can all be verified with the code `424242`.

Fictional phone numbers have the following structure:

`+1 (XXX) 555-0100` to `+1 (XXX) 555-0199`

For example:

`+12015550100`

`+19735550133`

### Email links

Testing email links in E2E suites is an uphill task. We recommend turning on the [**Email verification code**](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options#email) setting, and using that flow to authenticate your tests. The flows are very similar.

## Code examples

### Testing sign in via email code

```tsx
const testSignInWithEmailCode = async () => {
  const { signIn } = useSignIn()

  const emailAddress = 'john+clerk_test@example.com'
  const signInResp = await signIn.create({ identifier: emailAddress })
  const { emailAddressId } = signInResp.supportedFirstFactors.find(
    (ff) => ff.strategy === 'email_code' && ff.safeIdentifier === emailAddress,
  )! as EmailCodeFactor

  await signIn.prepareFirstFactor({
    strategy: 'email_code',
    emailAddressId: emailAddressId,
  })

  const attemptResponse = await signIn.attemptFirstFactor({
    strategy: 'email_code',
    code: '424242',
  })

  if (attemptResponse.status == 'complete') {
    console.log('success')
  } else {
    console.log('error')
  }
}
```

### Testing sign up with phone number

```jsx
const testSignUpWithPhoneNumber = async () => {
  const { signUp } = useSignUp()

  await signUp.create({
    phoneNumber: '+12015550100',
  })
  await signUp.preparePhoneNumberVerification()

  const res = await signUp.attemptPhoneNumberVerification({
    code: '424242',
  })
  if (res.verifications.phoneNumber.status == 'verified') {
    console.log('success')
  } else {
    console.log('error')
  }
}
```
