# SAML SSO authentication flows

The SAML protocol supports two different methods in order to start an SSO flow: SP-initiated and IdP-initiated. This guide will explore the differences between the two.

## SP-initiated flow

In an SP-initiated flow:
- The user starts the authentication flow from your application (SP), by providing the email address.
- The user is redirected to the SAML provider (IdP) where they must authenticate themselves.
- After successful authentication, the user is redirected back to your application, gaining access to their account.

## IdP-initiated flow

In an IdP-initiated flow:
- The user starts the authentication flow from the SAML provider (IdP), by selecting which application (SP) they would like to access.
- The user is redirected to the application of their choice, gaining access to their account.

  IdP-Initiated flow carries [a security risk](#risks-of-idp-initiated-flow). We recommend using a SP-Initiated flow whenever possible.

To allow IdP-initiated flows for your Enterprise Connection:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).
2. In the navigation sidebar, select **User & Authentication > [Enterprise Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/enterprise-connections)**.
3. Select the Enterprise Connection you want to enable IdP-initiated flow for.
4. Select the **Advanced** tab.
5. Toggle on **Allow IdP-Initiated flow**.

### Risks of IdP-initiated flow

By enabling IdP-Initiated flow, you allow Clerk to receive unsolicited authentication requests by the Identity Provider. Neither the Service Provider or the Identity Provider will be able to verify that the flow was initiated by the specified user.

As a result, the flow is susceptible to MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks in which a bad actor hijacks the IdP response and uses it to gain access to a compromised account.

A bad actor could also can intercept the IdP response and replace it with another to make the target user to sign in as the attacker, performing a Login CSRF attack.

Even if the IdP-initiated flow is considered insecure, Clerk tries to mitigate those flaws in order to protect and offer the best possible security for your application and users.

#### Unsolicited `InResponseTo` attribute

In accordance with the [SAML 2.0 profiles specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-profiles-2.0-os.pdf), Clerk ensures that an unsolicited response does not contain an `InResponseTo` attribute.

This prevents bad actors from stealing a response used in an SP-initiated flow and using it in an IdP-initiated flow.

#### Replay detection

Clerk prevents responses from being re-used by consuming them and remembering which have already been used.
This prevents bad actors from stealing and reusing a response to gain access to a user's account.

#### Use small validation periods

Each SAML response defines when they were issued and when they will expire. As an IdP-initiated flow is expected to be completed within a time frame of seconds, you must ensure that these validation periods are as small as possible.

#### Multi-Factor

MFA is available for the SAML IdP-initiated flow.
