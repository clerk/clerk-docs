## Enable billing

To enable billing for your application, navigate to the [**Billing Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/settings) page in the Clerk Dashboard. This page will guide you through enabling billing for your application.

Clerk billing costs just 0.7% per transaction, plus Stripe's transaction fees which are paid directly to Stripe.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Clerk Billing is **not** the same as Stripe Billing. Plans and pricing are managed directly through the Clerk Dashboard and won't sync with your existing Stripe products or plans. Clerk uses Stripe **only** for payment processing, so you don't need to set up Stripe Billing.

### Payment gateway

Once you have enabled billing, you will see the following **Payment gateway** options for collecting payments via Stripe:

- **Clerk development gateway**: A shared **test** Stripe account so developers can get started testing and building with billing **in development** without needing to create and configure a Stripe account.
- **Stripe account**: Use your own Stripe account.
