  - Use Box to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with Box allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Box account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Box**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Box as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Box**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Create a Box app

  1. On the homepage of the [Box Developer Console](https://app.box.com/developers/console), select **Custom App**. A modal will open.
  1. Fill out the necessary information. Use Box's [guide on OAuth 2.0 setup](https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/oauth2/oauth2-setup/#app-creation-steps) to help you.
  1. Select **Next**.
  1. In the list of authentication methods, select **User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)**.
  1. Select **Create App**. You'll be redirected to the app's **Configuration** page.
  1. In the **OAuth 2.0 Redirect URIs** section, paste the **Redirect URI** value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. In the **OAuth 2.0 Credentials** section, save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** somewhere secure.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/set-client-id-secret" />

  ### Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/social-connections/test-your-connection" />
</Steps>
