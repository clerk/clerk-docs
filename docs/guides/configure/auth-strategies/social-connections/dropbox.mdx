Enabling OAuth with Dropbox allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Dropbox account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Dropbox**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Dropbox as a social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Dropbox**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep this modal and page open.

  ### Configure your Dropbox app

  1. In the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps), select a project or [create a new one](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create).
  1. On your app's **Settings** page, save the **App key** and **App secret** somewhere secure.
  1. In the **Redirect URIs** input, paste the **Redirect URI** value you saved from the Clerk Dashboard and select **Add**.

  ### Set the App Key and App Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open. Paste the **App key** and **App secret** values that you saved into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the values into their respective fields.

  ### Test your connection
