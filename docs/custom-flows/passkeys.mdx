# Passkeys

<Callout type="Info">
  Passkey user sign-in is available on Pro plans. [Upgrade](/pricing) to enable this feature.
</Callout>

A passkey is a type of sign-in credential that requires one user action, but uses two authentication factors:
  1. A pin number or biometric data
  1. A physical device

Because of this, passkeys are generally more secure than passwords, and you should allow users to sign into your Clerk app with them. You can do so with the prebuilt `<SignIn>` component, or with Clerk's JS SDK.

<Callout type="Info">
  Users can't create passkeys with the `<SignUp>` component.
</Callout>

## Enable passkeys in your dashboard

To use passkeys, you must first enable the feature in your Clerk Dashboard:

- Instructions
- Go
- Here

## Manage user passkeys

If you're using the prebuilt `<UserProfile>` component, your users can create and manage their passkeys in the **Security** section of their account portal. The following instructions will teach you how to enable this functionality with a custom UI.

### Create user passkeys

To create a passkey for a user, you must call the `createPasskey()` method on the `User` object as shown in the following example:

<CodeBlockTabs options={["Next.js App router"]}>
```ts filename="components/CustomCreatePasskeysButton.tsx"
create code here
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Rename user passkeys

Sometimes users may want to rename a passkey to make it easier to identify. To rename a user's passkey in your Clerk app, you must call the `x()` method of the `x` object as shown in the following example: 

<CodeBlockTabs options={["Next.js App router"]}>
```ts filename="components/RenamePasskeyForm.tsx"
rename code here
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Delete user passkeys

To delete a user's passkey from your Clerk app, you must call the `x()` method of the `x` object as shown in the following example: 

<CodeBlockTabs options={["Next.js App router"]}>
```ts filename="components/DeletePasskeyForm.tsx"
delete code here
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Sign a user in with a passkey

To sign a user into your Clerk app with a passkey, you must call the `authenticateWithPasskey()` method of the `SignIn` object. This method allows users to choose from discoverable passkeys, such as hardware keys or passkeys in password managers.

If called when the page loads, this method will prompt users to autofill their passkey information.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["Next.js App router"]}>
```ts filename="app/passkey-example/page.tsx"
authenticate code here
```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Limitations

- Passkeys are not currently available as an MFA option.
- Not all devices and browsers are compatible with passkeys. passkeys are built on WebAuthn technology, and you should check [the Browser Compatibility docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API#browser_compatibility) for an up to date list.
    - Passkeys are not officially supported in browsers on iOS devices.
