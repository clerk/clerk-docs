  - Use GitHub to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their GitHub account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and choose **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **GitHub**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your GitHub account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [GitHub Developers](https://GitHub.com/developers/applications) page.

<Steps>
  ### Enable GitHub as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and choose **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **GitHub**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create a GitHub app

  1. On a separate page, go to [GitHub's Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/apps).
  1. In the sidebar, select **OAuth Apps**, then select [**New OAuth app**](https://github.com/settings/applications/new). You'll be redirected to the **Register a new OAuth app** form.
  1. Enter your **Application name** and **Homepage URL**.
  1. In **Authorization callback URL**, paste the **Redirect URI** you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Register application**. You'll be redirected to your GitHub app's **General** page.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  1. In the GitHub app's **General** page, select **Generate a new client secret**. Save your **Client ID** and **Client secret** somewhere secure.
  1. Navigate back to your Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open and paste these values into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the GitHub connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal) page.
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:

  - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
  - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`

  1. Sign in with your GitHub account.
