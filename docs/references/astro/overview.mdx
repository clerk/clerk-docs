The Clerk Astro SDK is the recommended method for integrating Clerk into your Astro application.

## Guides

- [Read session and user data](/docs/references/astro/read-session-data)
- [Migrate from the Astro community SDK to the official Clerk SDK](/docs/references/astro/migrating-from-astro-community-sdk)

## Client-side helpers

The Astro SDK provides [stores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) that give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object and helper methods for authentication flows.

- [`$authStore`](/docs/references/astro/auth-store)
- [`$clerkStore`](/docs/references/astro/clerk-store)
- [`$userStore`](/docs/references/astro/user-store)
- [`$signInStore`](/docs/references/astro/sign-in-store)
- [`$signUpStore`](/docs/references/astro/sign-up-store)
- [`$sessionStore`](/docs/references/astro/session-store)
- [`$sessionListStore`](/docs/references/astro/session-list-store)
- [`$organizationStore`](/docs/references/astro/organization-store)

## Server-side helpers

The following references show how to integrate Clerk features into your Astro app on the server-side.

### Locals

The Astro SDK provides access to Clerk's authentication data through Astro's [`locals`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/#storing-data-in-contextlocals) object. The following references show how to access authentication data in server-side code:

- [Auth](/docs/references/astro/locals#auth)
- [CurrentUser](/docs/references/astro/locals#currentuser)

#### `Auth` object

`Astro.locals.auth()` returns an `Auth` object. This JavaScript object contains important information like session data, your user's ID, as well as their active organization ID. Learn more about the `Auth` object [here](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object){{ target: '_blank' }}.

### `clerkMiddleware()`

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication and authorization into your Astro application through middleware. You can learn more [here](/docs/references/astro/clerk-middleware).
