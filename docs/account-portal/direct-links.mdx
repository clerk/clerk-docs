## Redirect URL

If a user accesses an Account Portal page *directly*, the `redirect_url` query param will not be present, so the user cannot be redirected back to your application once they are finished with their Account Portal flow. To prevent this, it is recommend that you always specify the redirect in the link when sharing it. 

You can use the following format for your direct links:

`https://accounts.<your-domain.com>/<account-portal-page>?redirect_url=<your-redirect-url>`

**Example**  

If you use `https://accounts.myapp.com/sign-in?redirect_url=https://myapp.com/dashboard` 

The domain is `myapp.com`, the user is being linked to the sign-in Account Portal page at `http://accounts.myapp.com/sign-in` and they will be redirected to `https://myapp.com/dashboard` after they are signed in.



## Fallback redirects

In the case that a user does visit an Account Portal page directly without the query param, don't worry - Clerk offers a fallback configuration via the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com).

<Steps>

### Set your static fallback host

To set your fallback host, in the Clerk Dashboard, go to the **[Paths](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=paths)** page.

For development, set your static fallback localhost with the port that you use (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`). Clerk will use this fallback host if a dev browser fails to be retrieved for your client. 

In production, the default is your application homepage.

### Configure fallback redirects

To specify the fallback redirects, in the Clerk Dashboard, go to the **[Account Portal](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal)** page and open the **Redirects** tab.

## Prefill sign in and sign up fields

In the case of direct links, the values to be used for prefilling the fields for sign-in or sign-up can be specified via the following query parameters:

* `email_address`
* `phone_number`
* `username`
* `first_name`
* `last_name`

For example, visiting `https://accounts.example.com/sign-in?username=nick` will result in the username field being prefilled with the value `nick`.
