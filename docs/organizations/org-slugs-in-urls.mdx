</TutorialHero>

Organization slugs are human-readable URL identifiers that help users reference which organization they're working in. A common pattern for organization-scoped areas in an application is to include the organization slug in the URL path.

For example, a B2B application named "Petstore" has two customer organizations: **Acmecorp** and **Widgetco**. Each organization uses its name as a slug in the URL:

- **Acmecorp**: `https://petstore.example.com/orgs/`**`acmecorp`**`/dashboard`
- **Widgetco**: `https://petstore.example.com/orgs/`**`widgetco`**`/dashboard`

Alternatively, [organization IDs](/docs/references/javascript/organization#properties) can be used to identify organizations in URLs:

- **Acmecorp**: `https://petstore.example.com/orgs/`**`org_1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8e`**`/dashboard`
- **Widgetco**: `https://petstore.example.com/orgs/`**`org_1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8f`**`/dashboard`

### When to use organization slugs

This feature is intended for apps that **require** organization slugs in URLs. **Adding slugs to URLs isn't recommended unless necessary.**

Use organization slugs if:

- Users frequently share links for public-facing content (e.g., documentation, marketing materials, and third-party blogs)
- Users regularly switch between multiple organizations
- Organization-specific URLs provide meaningful context

**Don't** use organization slugs if:

- Most users belong to only one organization
- You want to keep URLs simple and consistent
- You're primarily using the Clerk session for organization context

This guide shows you how to add organization slugs to your app's URLs, configure Clerk components to handle slug-based navigation, and access organization data based on the URL slug at runtime.

<Steps>
  ## Configure your app's URL structure

  Your application URLs should be structured to indicate which sections of your app are scoped to organizations versus [personal accounts](/docs/organizations/organization-workspaces#organization-workspaces-in-the-clerk-dashboard:~:text=Personal%20account).

  The following example uses the following URL structure:

  - `/orgs/` indicates the **active organization**, followed by the **organization slug**
  - `/me/` indicates the **active personal account**

  | URL | What should be active? | What should be displayed? |
  | - | - | - |
  | `/orgs/acmecorp` | Organization Acmecorp | Acmecorp's home page |
  | `/orgs/acmecorp/settings` | Organization Acmecorp | Acmecorp's settings page |
  | `/me` | Personal account | Personal home page |
  | `/me/settings` | Personal account | Personal settings page |

  ## Configure `<OrganizationSwitcher />` and `<OrganizationList />`

  The [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/components/organization/organization-switcher) and [`<OrganizationList />`](/docs/components/organization/organization-list) components provide a robust set of options to manage organization slugs and IDs in your application's URLs.

  Set the following properties to configure the components to handle slug-based navigation:

  - Set `hideSlug` to `false` to allow users to customize the organization's URL slug when creating an organization.
  - Set `hidePersonal` to `false` to allow users to select their personal account.
  - Set `afterCreateOrganizationUrl` to `/orgs/:slug` to navigate the user to the organization's slug after creating an organization.
  - Set `afterSelectOrganizationUrl` to `/orgs/:slug` to navigate the user to the organization's slug after selecting it.
  - Set `afterSelectPersonalUrl` to `/me` to navigate the user to their personal account after selecting it.

  For example, if the organization has the slug `acmecorp`:

  - When a user creates or selects that organization using either component, they'll be redirected to `/orgs/acmecorp`.
  - When a user selects their personal account using either component, they'll be redirected to `/me`.

        return (
          <OrganizationList
            hideSlug={false} // Allow users to customize the org's URL slug
            hidePersonal={false} // Allow users to select their personal account
            afterCreateOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug" // Navigate to the org's slug after creating an org
            afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug" // Navigate to the org's slug after selecting it
            afterSelectPersonalUrl="/me" // Navigate to the personal account after selecting it
          />
        )
      }
      ```

  ## Configure `clerkMiddleware()` to set the active organization

  > [!TIP]
  > If your app doesn't use `clerkMiddleware()`, or you prefer to manually set the active organization, use the [`setActive()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk) method to control the active organization on the client-side. See [this guide](/docs/organizations/force-organizations#set-an-active-organization-based-on-the-url) to learn how to manually activate a specific organization based on the URL.

  With [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware), you can use the [`organizationSyncOptions`](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#organization-sync-options) property to declare URL patterns that determine whether a specific organization or user's personal account should be activated.

  If the middleware detects one of these patterns in the URL and finds that a different organization is active in the session, it'll attempt to set the specified organization as the active one.

  In the following example, two `organizationPatterns` are defined: one for the root (e.g., `/orgs/acmecorp`) and one as the wildcard matcher `(.*)` to match `/orgs/acmecorp/any/other/resource`. This configuration ensures that the path `/orgs/:slug` with any optional trailing path segments will set the organization indicated by the slug as the active one.

  The same pattern is used with `personalAccountPatterns` to match the user's personal account.

  > [!WARNING]
  > If no organization with the specified slug exists, or if the user isn't a member of the organization, then `clerkMiddleware()` **won't** modify the active organization. Instead, it will leave the previously active organization unchanged on the Clerk session.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts', mark: [[7, 18]] }}
  import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  export default clerkMiddleware(
    (auth, req) => {
      // Add your middleware checks
    },
    {
      organizationSyncOptions: {
        organizationPatterns: [
          '/orgs/:slug', // Match the org slug
          '/orgs/:slug/(.*)', // Wildcard match for optional trailing path segments
        ],
        personalAccountPatterns: [
          '/me', // Match the personal account
          '/me/(.*)', // Wildcard match for optional trailing path segments
        ],
      },
    },
  )

  export const config = {
    matcher: [
      // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
      '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
      // Always run for API routes
      '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
    ],
  }
  ```

  ### Handle failed activation

  Now that `clerkMiddleware()` is configured to activate organizations, you can build an organization-specific page while handling cases where the organization  can't be activated.

  Failed activation occurs if no organization with the specified slug exists, or if the given user isn't a member of the organization. When this happens, the middleware won't change the active organization, leaving the previously active one unchanged.

  For troubleshooting, a message will also be logged on the server:

  > Clerk: Organization activation handshake loop detected. This is likely due to an invalid organization ID or slug. Skipping organization activation.

  It's ultimately the responsibility of the page to ensure that it renders the appropriate content for a given URL, and to handle the case where the expected organization **isn't** active.

  In the following example, the organization slug is detected as a Next.js [Dynamic Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) param and passed as a parameter to the page. If the slug doesn't match the active organization slug, an error message is rendered and the [`<OrganizationList />`](/docs/components/organization/organization-list) component allows the user to select a valid organization.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/orgs/[slug]/page.tsx' }}
  import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
  import { OrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs'

  export default async function Home({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
    const { orgSlug } = await auth()

    // Check if the organization slug from the URL params doesn't match
    // the active organization slug from the user's session.
    // If they don't match, show an error message and the list of valid organizations.
    if (params.slug != orgSlug) {
      return (
        <>
          <p>Sorry, organization {params.slug} is not valid.</p>
          <OrganizationList
            hideSlug={false}
            hidePersonal={false}
            afterCreateOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
            afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
            afterSelectPersonalUrl="/me"
          />
        </>
      )
    }

    return <div>Welcome to organization {orgSlug}</div>
  }
  ```

  ## Render organization-specific content

  Use the following tabs to learn how to access organization information on the server-side and client-side.

  <Tabs items={["Server-side","Client-side"]}>
    <Tab>
      To get organization information on the server-side, access the [`Auth`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object) object. In Next.js apps, this object is returned by [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth). In other frameworks, use the [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) helper to get the `Auth` object.

      To access additional organization information like the organization name, you'll need to [customize the Clerk session token](/docs/backend-requests/custom-session-token) to include these details:

      1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Sessions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=sessions) page.
      1. In the **Customize session token** section, select **Edit**.
      1. In the modal that opens, add any claim you need to your session token. For this guide, add the following:
         ```json
         {
           "org_name": "{{org.name}}"
         }
         ```
      1. Select **Save**.

      Then, access the [`sessionClaims`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#:~:text=sessionClaims)
      on the `Auth` object.

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/orgs/[slug]/page.tsx', mark: [[23, 24]] }}
      import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
      import { OrganizationList } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default async function Home({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
        const { orgSlug } = await auth()

        if (params.slug != orgSlug) {
          return (
            <>
              <p>Sorry, organization {params.slug} is not valid.</p>
              <OrganizationList
                hideSlug={false}
                hidePersonal={false}
                afterCreateOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
                afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
                afterSelectPersonalUrl="/me"
              />
            </>
          )
        }

        // Access the organization name from the session claims
        let orgName = authObject.sessionClaims['org_name'] as string
        return <div>{orgName && `Welcome to organization ${orgName}`}</div>
      }
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      To get organization information on the client-side, use the [`useOrganization()`](/docs/hooks/use-organization) hook to access the [`organization`](/docs/references/javascript/organization) object.

      ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/orgs/[slug]/page.tsx', mark: [24] }}
      'use client'

      import { OrganizationList, useOrganization } from '@clerk/nextjs'

      export default function Home({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
        const { organization } = useOrganization()

        if (!organization || organization.slug != params.slug) {
          return (
            <>
              <p>Sorry, organization {params.slug} is not valid.</p>
              <OrganizationList
                hidePersonal={false}
                hideSlug={false}
                afterCreateOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
                afterSelectOrganizationUrl="/orgs/:slug"
                afterSelectPersonalUrl="/me"
              />
            </>
          )
        }

        // Access the organization name from the organization object
        return <div>{organization && `Welcome to organization ${organization.name}`}</div>
      }
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Steps>
