## How to use the `useSession()` hook

### Access the `Session` object

The following example uses the `useSession()` hook to access the `Session` object, which has the `lastActiveAt` property. The `lastActiveAt` property is a `Date` object used to show the time the session was last active.

```tsx {{ filename: 'src/Home.tsx' }}
import { useSession } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

export default function Home() {
  const { isLoaded, session, isSignedIn } = useSession()

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null
  }
  if (!isSignedIn) {
    // Handle signed out state
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>This session has been active since {session.lastActiveAt.toLocaleString()}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```
