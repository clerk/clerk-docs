  - Use TikTok ID to authenticate users with OAuth.
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [TikTok](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/login-kit-manage-user-access-tokens) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their TikTok account.

## Configure for your development instance

Due to TikTok's requirement to verify URL ownership for all redirect URLs, **TikTok cannot be used with shared credentials in development environments.** This is because individual users can't verify ownership of the Clerk development URL (`accounts.dev`).

However, TikTok can be used in development environments if you create a sandbox app and configure custom credentials. In this case, you'll need to [verify the redirect URL](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/getting-started-create-an-app#verify_url_ownership) specific to your [sandbox app](https://developers.tiktok.com/blog/introducing-sandbox).

It is recommended to test this integration in a staging or preview environment, as shared credentials require URL verification to function properly.

## Configure for your production instance

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [TikTok Developer Portal](https://developers.tiktok.com/).

<Steps>
  ### Enable TikTok as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **TikTok**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create your app in TikTok

  > [!TIP]
  > If you're creating an app as an organization rather than as an individual developer, you must first [create an organization](https://developers.tiktok.com/organizations). For guidance on which option to choose, refer to [TikTok's guide on working with organizations](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/working-with-organizations/).

  1. On a separate page, go to the [TikTok Developer Portal](https://developers.tiktok.com/) and sign in.
  1. In the top-right, select [**Developer Portal**](https://developers.tiktok.com/apps), then select **Manage apps**. You'll be redirected to the **Manage apps** page.
  1. Select **Connect an app**. Complete the form then select **Confirm**. You'll be redirected to your **App details** page.
  1. In the **Basic information** section, complete the form.
  1. Under **Platforms**, select your platform then paste your app URL.
  1. Select the **Verify URL properties** under any of the URL fields to verify your app URL. A modal will open.
  1. Select **Verify properties**. For Property Type, select either **Domain** to verify ownership of the enter website, including subdomains, or **URL prefix** to verify ownership of a specific part of the website (e.g., `example.com/shop/`).
  1. Enter your website and select **Verify**.
  1. Follow the instructions in the modal to verify your domain with your host provider. After entering the necessary information in your hosting provider's DNS settings, select **Verified**. Once your property is verified, select **Ok**.
  1. Select **Submit for review**. Keep this page open.

  > [!NOTE]
  > Your app needs to be reviewed by TikTok before the registration completes. This process may take a few days.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  1. In your TikTok app's **App details** page, select the icons next to the **Client key** and **Client secret** to reveal them. Copy these values.
  1. Navigate back to your Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open and paste these values into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the **TikTok** connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal) page.
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:

  - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
  - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`

  1. Sign in with your TikTok account.
