title: '`usePaymentElement()`'
description: Clerk's usePaymentElement() hook provides methods and state for interacting with a payment form.
sdk: nextjs, react
---

<Include src="_partials/billing/billing-experimental" />

The `usePaymentElement()` hook is used to control the payment form rendered by the [`<PaymentElement />`](#payment-element) component. It provides the necessary state and methods to submit payment details to a payment provider like Stripe.

This hook must be used within a component that is a descendant of the `<PaymentElementProvider />` component. It is typically used in a checkout flow that prompts a user to add a new payment method, or for adding a new payment method outside of a checkout.

## Parameters

`usePaymentElement()` doesn't accept any parameters. It derives its state and configuration from the nearest [`<PaymentElementProvider />`](#payment-element-provider).

## Returns

`usePaymentElement()` returns an object with the following properties:

<Typedoc src="shared/use-payment-element-return" />

## Payment element components

The `usePaymentElement()` hook works in conjunction with the `<PaymentElementProvider />` and `<PaymentElement />` components.

### `<PaymentElementProvider />`

The `<PaymentElementProvider />` component sets up the context for the payment element. It fetches all the necessary data from the payment provider (e.g., Stripe) and makes it available to its children.

#### Properties

<Typedoc src="shared/payment-element-provider-props" />

### `<PaymentElement />`

This component renders the actual payment form from the provider (e.g., the Stripe Payment Element). It should be rendered as a child of `<PaymentElementProvider />`.

#### Properties

<Typedoc src="shared/payment-element-props" />

## Example

<Include src="_partials/billing/add-new-payment-method" />
