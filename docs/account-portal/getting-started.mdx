# Getting started with the Account Portal  

To integrate the Account Portal into your application, simply follow one of our [quickstart guides](/docs/quickstarts/overview). 

Once your application is set up, all you have to do is fire it up. Clerk will automatically redirect your users to the Account Portal sign-in/sign-up pages. Once a user has successfully authenticated themself, they will be automatically redirected back to your application with an active session.

  **Dynamic Development Host Detection**  

  For development environments, the development host (e.g. http://localhost:3000) is dynamically detected by Clerk at runtime and tied to your client browser. We store this as the â€˜home originâ€™ for your application and it is equivalent to your application domain in production environments.

## Fallback redirects

After a user has finished their flow in an Account Portal page, Clerk automatically redirects them back to your application by appending a `redirect_url` query param on the Account Portal page. However, if a user accesses an Account Portal page directly, they cannot be redirected back to your application since they didn't originate from your application. Don't worry, Clerk offers configurable fallback redirects.

<Steps>

### Set your static fallback host

Set your fallback host under **Paths** in the Clerk Dashboard. 

For development, set your static fallback localhost with the port that you use (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`). Clerk will use this fallback host if a dev browser fails to be retrieved for your client. In production, this will always be your application homepage.

### Configure fallback redirects

Specify the fallback redirects under **Account Portal -> Redirects** in the Clerk Dashboard.

## Direct links

If you would like to provide users with a direct link to an Account Portal page, you need to specify the redirect in the link so that users can be redirected to your application after their Account Portal flow.

### Development 

For development instances, you can use the following format for your direct links:

`https://accounts.<your-domain.com>/<account-portal-page>?redirect_url=http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

#### Example

In this example, the domain is `clerk.dev`, the user is being linked to the sign-in Account Portal page, and the user will be redirected to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` after their Account Portal flow.

`https://accounts.clerk.dev/sign-in?redirect_url=http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

### Production

For production instances, you can use the following format for your direct links:

`https://accounts.<your-domain.com>/<account-portal-page>?redirect_url=https://<your-domain.com>/dashboard`

#### Example

In this example, the domain is `clerk.dev`, the user is being linked to the sign-in Account Portal page, and the user will be redirected to `https://clerk.dev/dashboard` after their Account Portal flow.

`https://accounts.clerk.dev/sign-in?redirect_url=https://clerk.dev/dashboard`
