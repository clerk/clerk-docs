**First factor** is the first factor of authentication that is required to complete the authentication process. For example, when a user signs in with email and password, the password is the first factor. **First factor verification** is the process of verifying a user's identity using a single factor. This can be compared to [second factor verification](!second-factor-verification), also known as two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA), where the user needs to provide an additional factor to verify their identity.
