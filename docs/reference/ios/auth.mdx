Use `Auth` for sign-in and sign-up flows, and to manage sessions.

## Sign in

### Sign in with Password

Sign in directly with an identifier (email, phone, or username) and password:

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signInWithPassword(
  identifier: "user@email.com",
  password: "secretpassword"
)
```

### Sign in with OTP (Email)

Automatically sends a code to the email address:

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signInWithEmailCode(emailAddress: "user@email.com")
signIn = try await signIn.verifyCode("123456")
```

### Sign in with OTP (Phone)

Automatically sends a code to the phone number:

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signInWithPhoneCode(phoneNumber: "+1234567890")
signIn = try await signIn.verifyCode("123456")
```

### Sign in with OAuth

Sign in using an OAuth provider (e.g., Google, GitHub):

```swift
var result = try await clerk.auth.signInWithOAuth(provider: .google)
```

### Sign in with Apple

Sign in using Sign in with Apple:

```swift
var result = try await clerk.auth.signInWithApple()
```

See the [Sign in with Apple guide](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-in-with-apple){{ target: '_blank' }} for native iOS setup.

### Sign in with ID Token

Sign in with an ID token from a provider:

```swift
var result = try await clerk.auth.signInWithIdToken(
  idToken,
  provider: .apple
)
```

### Sign in with Passkey

Sign in using a passkey:

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signInWithPasskey()
```

### Sign in with Enterprise SSO

Sign in using Enterprise SSO:

```swift
var result = try await clerk.auth.signInWithEnterpriseSSO(emailAddress: "user@company.com")
```

### Sign in with Ticket

Sign in using a ticket generated from the Backend API:

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signInWithTicket(ticket)
```

### Sign in with Identifier

Start a sign-in with an identifier (email, phone, or username):

```swift
// Email
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signIn("user@email.com")
```

```swift
// Phone
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signIn("+1234567890")
```

```swift
// Username
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signIn("johndoe")
```

### Continue an Existing Sign-In

Use these methods when you already have a `SignIn` from `clerk.auth.signIn(...)` and want to complete it with a specific factor or provider.

#### Send and verify email code

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.sendEmailCode()
signIn = try await signIn.verifyCode("123456")
```

#### Send and verify phone code

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.sendPhoneCode()
signIn = try await signIn.verifyCode("123456")
```

#### Authenticate with password

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.authenticateWithPassword("secretpassword")
```

#### Authenticate with OAuth

```swift
var result = try await signIn.authenticateWithOAuth(provider: .google)
```

#### Authenticate with Enterprise SSO

```swift
var result = try await signIn.authenticateWithEnterpriseSSO()
```

#### Authenticate with Apple

```swift
var result = try await signIn.authenticateWithApple()
```

See the [Sign in with Apple guide](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-in-with-apple){{ target: '_blank' }} for native iOS setup.

#### Authenticate with ID token

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.authenticateWithIdToken(
  idToken,
  provider: .apple
)
```

#### Authenticate with passkey

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.authenticateWithPasskey()
```

### Multi-Factor Authentication

After completing first factor verification, if MFA is required, use these methods to complete the second factor verification. The examples assume you already have a `SignIn` from a sign-in flow.

#### MFA with phone code

Send and verify an MFA code via SMS:

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.sendMfaPhoneCode()
signIn = try await signIn.verifyMfaCode(
  "123456",
  type: .phoneCode
)
```

#### MFA with email code

Send and verify an MFA code via email:

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.sendMfaEmailCode()
signIn = try await signIn.verifyMfaCode(
  "123456",
  type: .emailCode
)
```

#### MFA with TOTP

Verify using a TOTP code from an authenticator app:

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.verifyMfaCode(
  "123456",
  type: .totp
)
```

#### MFA with backup code

Verify using a backup code:

```swift
signIn = try await signIn.verifyMfaCode(
  "backup123",
  type: .backupCode
)
```

### Password Reset

The Clerk iOS SDK provides methods to reset user passwords via email or phone verification.

#### Password Reset with email

Reset password using email verification:

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signIn("user@email.com")
signIn = try await signIn.sendResetPasswordEmailCode()
signIn = try await signIn.verifyCode("123456")
signIn = try await signIn.resetPassword(
  newPassword: "newpassword",
  signOutOfOtherSessions: true
)
```

#### Password Reset with phone

Reset password using phone verification:

```swift
var signIn = try await clerk.auth.signIn("+1234567890")
signIn = try await signIn.sendResetPasswordPhoneCode()
signIn = try await signIn.verifyCode("123456")
signIn = try await signIn.resetPassword(
  newPassword: "newpassword",
  signOutOfOtherSessions: true
)
```

## Sign up

### Sign up

Create a new account:

```swift
var signUp = try await clerk.auth.signUp(
    emailAddress: "newuser@email.com",
    phoneNumber: "+1234567890",
    password: "secretpassword",
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    username: "johndoe",
    legalAccepted: true
)
```

### Verify Email via OTP

Verify the email address for the new account:

```swift
signUp = try await signUp.sendEmailCode()
signUp = try await signUp.verifyEmailCode("123456")
```

### Verify Phone via OTP

Verify the phone number for the new account:

```swift
signUp = try await signUp.sendPhoneCode()
signUp = try await signUp.verifyPhoneCode("123456")
```

### Update a Sign Up

Update sign-up information:

```swift
signUp = try await signUp.update(
    emailAddress: "newuser@email.com",
    phoneNumber: "+1234567890",
    password: "secretpassword",
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    username: "johndoe",
    legalAccepted: true
)
```

### Sign up with OAuth

```swift
var result = try await clerk.auth.signUpWithApple()

var result = try await clerk.auth.signUpWithEnterpriseSSO(emailAddress: "user@company.com")
```

### Sign up with Ticket

Sign up using a ticket generated from the Backend API:

```

## Current Sign In/Sign Up

Access the in-progress sign in or sign up for multi-step flows.

### Sign In

```swift
var currentSignIn = clerk.auth.currentSignIn
```

### Sign Up

```swift
var currentSignUp = clerk.auth.currentSignUp
```

## Session management

The Clerk iOS SDK provides methods to manage user sessions, including signing out, switching sessions, and revoking sessions.

### Sessions

Retrieve all sessions for the current client:

```swift
var sessions = clerk.auth.sessions
```

### Active Sessions

Retrieve active sessions for the current client:

```swift
var activeSessions = clerk.auth.activeSessions
```

### Get Session Token

Retrieve the user's session token.

```swift
guard let token = try await clerk.auth.getToken() else { return }
```

Use this token when calling your backend to authenticate the request:

```swift
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
request.setValue("Bearer \(token)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
```

### Set Active Session

Set the active session and optionally the active organization:

```swift
try await clerk.auth.setActive(
  sessionId: sessionId,
  organizationId: organizationId
)
```


### Revoke Session

Revoke a specific session:

```swift
var revokedSession = try await clerk.auth.revokeSession(session)
```

### Sign Out

Sign out the active user:

```swift
// Sign out from all sessions
try await clerk.auth.signOut()

// Sign out from a specific session
try await clerk.auth.signOut(sessionId: sessionId)
```
