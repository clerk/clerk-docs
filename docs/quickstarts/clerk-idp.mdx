### Retrieve Callback URL from the client application

Retrieve the **Callback URL** for the client application you want to configure. This is where your users will be redirected to after a successful authentication and is required to successfully create your OAuth application in the next step.


### Create an OAuth Application in Clerk

Next, you need to create an OAuth Application in Clerk via the [Backend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/OAuth-Applications) by providing the Callback URL and a Name. Note that in this context the name is used to help you identify your application and is not displayed anywhere publicly.

```sh copy filename="POST /v1/oauth_applications"
curl
 -X POST https://api.clerk.com/v1/oauth_applications \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer <CLERK_SECRET_KEY>"  \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -D {"callback_url":"https://oauth-client.com/oauth2/callback", "name": "oauth_app_1"}
```

To create an OAuth Application that uses the authorization code flow with proof of key exchange (PKCE), set `public` to `true` in the POST request body.

```
{"callback_url":"https://oauth-public-client.com/oauth2/callback", "name": "oauth_app_pkce", "public": true}
```

Clerk creates an OAuth application and returns it's configurations back to you.


```json copy filename="RESPONSE"
{
    "object":"oauth_application",
    "id":"oa_2O4BCh3zUONvWlZHtBXv6s6tm7u",
    "instance_id":"ins_2O4Ak02T4fDmKKv6tK5h0WJ8ou8",
    "name":"oauth_app_1",
    "client_id":"d9g4CT4WYiCBm7EU",
    "client_secret":"VVgbT7i6sPo7sTljq2zj12fjmg0jPL5k",
    "scopes":"profile email",
    "callback_url":"https://oauth-client.com/oauth2/callback",
    "authorize_url":"https://clerk.your-domain.com/oauth/authorize",
    "token_fetch_url":"https://clerk.your-domain.com/oauth/token",
    "user_info_url":"https://clerk.your-domain.com/oauth/userinfo",
    "created_at":1680809847940,
    "updated_at":1680810135145
}
```

  For security reasons, we don’t store your Client Secret and cannot show it to you again, so we recommend you download the secret and store it someplace secure.

### Configure OAuth Application in client

Now that you have setup an OAuth application in Clerk, you will need to configure these settings in your Client.

* **Client ID**: Public identifier of your OAuth application
* **Client Secret**: Confidential secret used to authenticate your OAuth application
* **Authorization URL**: Used by the Client to request authorization from your user
* **Token URL**: Used by the Client to retrieve access tokens
* **Scopes**: OAuth scopes used to grant access to the Client. Clerk only supports `profile` and `email` at this point
* **User Info URL**: Used by the Client to retrieve the email address and profile (username, first and last name) associated to your user
