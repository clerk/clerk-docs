# Sync data to your backend with webhooks

A common setup for applications involves a frontend and some sort of backend storage system. Since authentication and user management happens on Clerk's side, data eventually need to reach the application's back-end.

The recommended way to sync data between Clerk and your application's backend is via webhooks. In this guide you'll learn how to enable webhooks and how to setup your back-end so that it is updated every time an event happens on your Clerk instance.

Given the asynchronous nature of webhooks, they might not fit in every use case out there but they are a great fit for most applications.

<Steps>

### Enable webhooks

To enable webhooks, go to the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks) page in the Clerk dashboard and click on the "Add Endpoint" button.

![Add endpoint](/docs/images/users/guides/sync-backend/enable-webhook.png)

You'll be presented with a form where you can specify the URL of your backend endpoint. This is the URL where Clerk will send the webhook events. You can also specify the events you want to receive. For example, if you only want to receive events related to users, you can select the "user" option.

![Add endpoint form](/docs/images/users/guides/sync-backend/webhook-form.png)

Once you click the "Create" button, you'll be presented with your webhook enpoint dashboard. Here you can see the URL of your endpoint and the events you selected and you can also test your endpoint.

### Setup your backend endpoint

Now that you have your webhook endpoint setup, you need to setup your backend endpoint to receive the events. The Clerk webhook events are sent as HTTP POST requests with a JSON body. The body of the request contains the event type and the data related to the event.

Here's an example of a webhook payload for a `user.created` event:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "birthday": "",
    "created_at": 1654012591514,
    "email_addresses": [
      {
        "email_address": "james@clerk.com"
      }
    ]
  },
  "object": "event",
  "type": "user.created"
}
```

To learn more about the payload structure, check out the [webhooks reference](/integrations/webhooks).

Now you need to setup your backend endpoint to receive the webhook events. The exact steps depend on the backend framework you're using. Below are some examples for common frameworks.

If you're using Next.js, you can create a webhook endpoint in the `pages/api` directory.

Svix provides a package for verifying the webhook signature, making it easy to verify the authenticity of the webhook events.

<CodeBlockTabs options={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  ```bash copy filename="your-project" copy
  npm install svix
  ```

```bash filename="your-project" copy
yarn add svix
```

```bash filename="your-project" copy
pnpm i svix
```

</CodeBlockTabs>

Next you will want to retrieve the Webhook signing secret from the Clerk Dashboard. You can find this in the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks) section of the Clerk Dashboard. You will need to set this as an environment variable in your Next.js project.

![signing-secret-example](/docs/images/users/guides/sync-backend/sign-secret.png)

```ts copy filename="pages/api/webhook.ts"
import type { IncomingHttpHeaders } from 'http';
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import type { WebhookRequiredHeaders } from 'svix';
import type { WebhookEvent } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
import { Webhook } from 'svix';

const webhookSecret: string = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET;

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequestWithSvixRequiredHeaders,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  const headers = req.headers;
  // Create a new Webhook instance with your webhook secret
  const wh = new Webhook(webhookSecret);

  let evt: WebhookEvent;
  try {
    // Verify the webhook payload and headers
    evt = wh.verify(payload, headers) as WebhookEvent;
  } catch (_) {
    // If the verification fails, return a 400 error
    return res.status(400).json({});
  }
  const { id } = evt.data;

  const eventType = evt.type;
  if (eventType === 'user.created') {
    console.log(`User ${id} was ${eventType}`);
    res.status(201).json({});
  }
}

type NextApiRequestWithSvixRequiredHeaders = NextApiRequest & {
  headers: IncomingHttpHeaders & WebhookRequiredHeaders;
};
```

### Testing the webhook

To test a webhook locally, you can use a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server to the internet. You can then use the ngrok URL as the webhook URL in the Clerk Dashboard.

If you are testing webhooks outside of your development you can use our webhook test requests to test your webhook. You can find these in the [Webhooks](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks) section of the Clerk Dashboard.
