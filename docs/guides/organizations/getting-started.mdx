Organizations let you group users with Roles and Permissions, enabling you to build multi-tenant B2B apps like Slack (workspaces), Linear (teams), or Vercel (projects) where users can switch between different team contexts. This tutorial will demonstrate how to add Organizations, create and switch Organizations, and protect routes by Organization and Roles.

> [!WARNING]
> This guide assumes that you have already set up Clerk in your application. If you haven't, see the [quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart).

<Steps>
  ## Add `<OrganizationSwitcher/>` to your app

  The [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher) component is the easiest way to let users create, switch between, and manage Organizations. It's recommended to place it in your app's header or navigation so it's always accessible to your users. For example:

  <Include src="_partials/organizations/organization-switcher-snippet" />

  ## Access Organization data

  <Include src="_partials/organizations/access-organization-data/overview" />

  ## Visit your app

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit your app locally in the browser.

  ### Enable Organizations

  When prompted, select **Enable Organizations**. Choose to make membership required.

  ### Create first user and Organization

  You must sign in to use Organizations. When prompted, select **Sign in to continue**. Then, authenticate to create your first user.

  Since you chose to make membership required when you enabled Organizations, every user must be in at least one Organization. [Clerk will prompt you](!choose-organization) to create an Organization for your user.

  ## Create and switch Organizations

  At this point, Clerk should have redirected you to a page with the [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher) component. This component allows you to create, switch between, and manage organizations.

  1. Select the `<OrganizationSwitcher />` component, then **Create an organization**.
  1. Enter `Acme Corp` as the Organization name.
  1. Invite users to your Organization and select their Role.

  ## Protect routes by Organization and Roles

  You can protect content and even entire routes based on Organization membership, Roles, and Permissions by performing [authorization checks](!authorization-check).

  In the following example, the page is protected from unauthenticated users, users that don't have the `org:admin` Role, and users that are not in the `Acme Corp` Organization. It uses the [`has()`](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object#has) helper to perform the authorization check for the `org:admin` Role.

  <Include src="_partials/organizations/protect-routes/overview" />

  Navigate to the `/protected` route in your app. You should see a green message confirming you are an admin in `Acme Corp`. Use the `<OrganizationSwitcher/>` to switch Organizations or rename the Organization to show the red message.

  Learn more about protecting routes and checking Organization Roles in the [authorization guide](/docs/guides/organizations/control-access/roles-and-permissions).
