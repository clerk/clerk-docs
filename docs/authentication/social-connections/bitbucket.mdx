How to set up social connection with Bitbucket

## Overview

Adding social connection with Bitbucket to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you will need to populate the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses  preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Consumer Key and Consumer Secret using your Bitbucket account.

> [!NOTE]
> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Bitbucket account and a Bitbucket OAuth Consumer - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your  application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Bitbucket account. To create one, [click here](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup).

## Configuring Bitbucket social connection

Firstly, you will need to have a Bitbucket workspace.

You can navigate to the [list of all your workspaces](https://bitbucket.org/account/workspaces/) to select an existing workspace or create a new one:

![Bitbucket workspace listing](/docs/images/authentication-providers/bitbucket/005f4b20222a0641a443f750e24d26fd088324db-3360x1896.png)

From there, click on the desired existing workspace or create a new one, then navigate to:

**Settings** > **Oauth Consumers**

![Bitbucket OAuth Consumer list](/docs/images/authentication-providers/bitbucket/b072d3a9f269a46468e651646d08522aa253fdaf-3360x1782.png)

You will need to create a consumer if you don't have one already.

The first important setting for the connection to work is the **Callback URL**. Paste the **Authorized redirect URI** from your Clerk Bitbucket settings in this field:

![OAuth consumer creation](/docs/images/authentication-providers/bitbucket/3c3f5f49188f740839a9e0f348ffe4d34a5300c3-3360x1782.png)

The rest of the form fields (**Name, Description, URL, Privacy Policy URL,  EULA URL**) can be set to match your application settings.

The second important setting is the selection of scopes that Clerk should request from Bitbucket upon connecting.

![Bitbucket OAuth Consumer scopes](/docs/images/authentication-providers/bitbucket/65aee792cbde8564897d5f1110caf090789bf532-1304x942.png)

Under **Account**, the **Email** & **Read** scopes should be enabled so that Clerk can use your basic Bitbucket account info when creating your Clerk user.

After saving the Oauth Consumer, Bitbucket will generate a **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** for you. These can be displayed by clicking on the **Consumer** entry in your OAuth Consumer list.

You will need to copy:

- The Bitbucket Client **Key** to the **Client ID** input on Clerk
- The Bitbucket Client **Secret** to the **Client Secret** input on Clerk

![Client ID and Client Secret inputs for Bitbucket connection](/docs/images/authentication-providers/bitbucket/c29fd970821d0746e7637f69bf8f411695638834-1220x784.png)

Congratulations! Social connection with Bitbucket is now configured for your instance.
