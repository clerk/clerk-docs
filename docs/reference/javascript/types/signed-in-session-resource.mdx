title: '`SignedInSessionResource`'
description: The SignedInSessionResource type represents a user-associated session and its current sign-in state.
sdk: js-frontend
---

An interface that represents a user-associated session, including its current sign-in status and any [pending task](/docs/guides/configure/session-tasks) required to complete authentication.

This interface includes all standard session properties from the [Session](/docs/reference/javascript/session) object and narrows them to sessions that are associated with a user and are either **active** or **pending**.

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `status`
  - `'active' | 'pending'`

  The current state of the session.

  - `active` indicates the session has completed all required sign-in steps and authentication factors.
  - `pending` indicates the user has signed in but must complete one or more additional steps.

  ---

  - `user`
  - [`User`](/docs/reference/javascript/user)

  The user associated with the session.

  ---

  - `currentTask`
  - <code>[SessionTask](/docs/reference/javascript/types/session-task)\[] | null</code>

  The pending tasks for the session. This property is only present when status is 'pending'.
</Properties>
