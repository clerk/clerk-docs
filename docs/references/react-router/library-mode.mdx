React Router can be used as a framework or as a standalone library. This guide explains how to add React Router authentication to an existing React application using library mode. To use React Router as a framework instead, see the [React Router quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/react-router).

<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/react-router`

  Once you have a Vite and React Router application ready, run the following command to install Clerk's React Router SDK.

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/react-router
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/react-router
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/react-router
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your Clerk API keys

  > [!NOTE]
  > You will not need the Clerk Secret Key in React Router's library mode, as it should never be used on the client-side.

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable Key.
    1. Add your key to your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  ```

  ### Add `<ClerkProvider>`

  <Include src="_partials/clerk-provider" />

  Pass your publishable key as a prop to the component.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [4, 8, [13, 17]] }}
  import { StrictMode } from 'react'
  import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
  import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router'
  import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/react-router'
  import './index.css'
  import App from './App.tsx'

  const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

  createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <StrictMode>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<App />} />
          </Routes>
        </ClerkProvider>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

  ### Configure redirect URLs

  Add `signInFallbackRedirectUrl` and `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl` props to the `<ClerkProvider>`. These control where users are redirected after signing in or signing up, as well as where they're redirected when clicking the links in the authentication components.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/main.tsx', mark: [6, 7] }}
  createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
    <StrictMode>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <ClerkProvider
          publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
          signInFallbackRedirectUrl="/"
          signUpFallbackRedirectUrl="/"
        >
          <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element={<App />} />
          </Routes>
        </ClerkProvider>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </StrictMode>,
  )
  ```

  ### Protect your pages

  Clerk offers [control components](/docs/components/overview) that allow you to protect your pages. These components are used to control the visibility of your pages based on the user's authentication state.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/App.tsx' }}
  import {
    SignInButton,
    SignOutButton,
    SignUpButton,
    SignedIn,
    SignedOut,
    UserButton,
  } from '@clerk/react-router'

  export default function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <SignedIn>
          <p>You're signed in!</p>
          <div>
            <p>View your profile</p>
            <UserButton />
          </div>
          <div>
            <SignOutButton />
          </div>
        </SignedIn>

        <SignedOut>
          <p>You're signed out</p>
          <div>
            <SignInButton />
          </div>
          <div>
            <SignUpButton />
          </div>
        </SignedOut>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```
</Steps>
