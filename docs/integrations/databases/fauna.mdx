title: Integrate Fauna with Clerk
description: Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Fauna application.
---

The first step is to create a new Clerk application from your Clerk Dashboard if you haven’t done so already. You can choose whichever authentication strategy and social sign-in providers you prefer. For more information, check out our [Set up your application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) guide.

After your Clerk application has been created, in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the **[API keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)** page and copy your **Publishable key**.

![The API keys page in the Clerk Dashboard. There is a red arrow pointing to the copy button next to the 'Publishable key'.](/docs/images/integrations/publishable-key.webp)

Next, log in to the [Fauna Dashboard](https://dashboard.fauna.com/) and click the database that you want Clerk-authenticated users to access. Then click the **Access Providers** tab.

![The Access Providers tab in the Fauna dashboard.](/docs/images/integrations/fauna/security-providers.webp)

Click the **Create Access Provider** button.

Enter a name in the **Name** field that will identify this access provider. The recommendation is to use “Clerk”.

Paste the **Publishable key** you copied from the Clerk Dashboard into the **Issuer** field and then prefix it with the `https://` protocol so it follows `https://<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>`

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you do not add a trailing slash / to the end of the Issuer URL or it will fail.

Assuming you didn’t use a custom signing key, set the **JWKS Endpoint** field to the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) URL Clerk automatically created with your Frontend API at `https://<YOUR_FRONTEND_API>/.well-known/jwks.json`

You can find this URL in the Clerk Dashboard on the **[API keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)** page. Scroll down and click on **Advanced**. In the **JWT public key** section, copy the **JWKS URL**.

![The API Keys page in the Clerk Dashboard. A red box outlines the 'Advanced' drop down button. A red arrow is pointing to the copy button next to 'JWKS URL' in the 'JWT public key' section.](/docs/images/integrations/jwks-url.webp)

The completed provider form should resemble the following:

Copy the **Audience** value and click **Create**.

In the Fauna Dashboard, update the access provider’s FSL schema to include a [user-defined role](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/learn/security/roles/). For example:

```fsl
access provider Clerk {
  ...

  // Adds a user-defined role to JWTs created by the access provider.
  role <role>
}
```

You can specify multiple `role` propertiesif needed. Don’t change the `issuer` or `jwks_uri` fields values.

Click **Save**.

## Create a new Fauna JWT template

In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the **[JWT Templates](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=jwt-templates)** page. Click on the **New template** button to create a new template based on Fauna.

![The JWT Templates page in the Clerk Dashboard. The 'New template' button was clicked, and a pop up titled 'New JWT template' is shown. The 'Fauna' template is hovered over.](/docs/images/integrations/fauna/jwt-templates.webp)

Once the Fauna template is created, you will be redirected to the template's page. You can now configure the template to your needs.

![The 'Create new template' page of the JWT Templates page in the Clerk Dashboard.](/docs/images/integrations/fauna/create-template.webp)

Scroll down to the **Claims** section and set the `aud` claim to the **Audience URL** you copied from Fauna. The URL format should be `https://db.fauna.com/db/<YOUR_FAUNA_DB_ID>`.

![The 'Create new template' page of the JWT Templates page in the Clerk Dashboard. The page is scrolled down to the 'Claims' section.](/docs/images/integrations/fauna/template-shortcodes.webp)

You can include additional claims if you’d like, but `aud` is the only required one. [Shortcodes](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates#shortcodes) are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.

Don't forget to click the **Apply changes** button at the bottom right to save your Fauna JWT template.

## Authenticating Fauna queries

The way to authenticate requests to Fauna with Clerk is to use a JWT. After adding the necessary claims in a JWT template, you can generate the token by calling the `getToken` method from the [`useAuth()`](/docs/references/react/use-auth) hook provided by Clerk.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs';
import { Client, fql } from "fauna";

const Example = () => {
  const { getToken } = useAuth();
  const [message, setMessage] = React.useState('');

  const makeQuery = async () => {
    let client;
    try {
      const secret = await getToken({ template: '<your-template-name>' });
      client = new Client({ secret: secret });
      const response = await client.query(fql`'Hello World!'`);
      setMessage(response);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      setMessage('Error occurred');
    } finally {
      if (client) client.close();
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={makeQuery}>Make authenticated query</button>
      <p>Message: {message}</p>
    </>
  );
};

export default Example;
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `getToken({ template: <your-template-name> })` call is asynchronous and returns a Promise that needs to be resolved before accessing the token value. This token is short-lived for better security and should be called before every request to your Fauna database. The caching and refreshing of the token are handled automatically by Clerk.

## Next steps

- Try adding some [custom claims](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates) to the JWT token.
