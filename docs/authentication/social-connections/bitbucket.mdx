  - Use Bitbucket to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [Bitbucket](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/oauth-2) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Bitbucket account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIsâ€”no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Bitbucket**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Bitbucket Workspaces](https://bitbucket.org/account/workspaces/) page.

<Steps>
  ### Enable Bitbucket as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Bitbucket**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Callback URL** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create a Bitbucket OAuth Consumer

  1. On a separate page, go to the [Bitbucket Workspaces](https://bitbucket.org/account/workspaces/) page and sign in.
  1. Under **Workspaces**, find your workspace and select **Manage**.
  1. In the sidenav, scroll down and select **OAuth consumers**.
  1. Select **Add consumer**.
  1. Complete the required fields. In  **Permissions** , under **Account**, select **Email** and **Read**.
  1. Select **Save**. You'll be redirected to the **OAuth consumers** page.
  1. Select your consumer and save the **Key** and **Secret** values somewhere secure.

  ### Set the Key and Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open. Paste the **Key** and **Secret** values that you saved into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is no longer open, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, paste the values into their respective fields.
