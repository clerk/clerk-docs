description: Learn how to use the Clerk Dashboard to manage your application settings, users, and more.
---

The Clerk Dashboard is where you create your Clerk application and is the central hub for managing your instance's settings, users, Organizations, and more.

At the top of the Clerk Dashboard, you will see a few notable features:

- The workspace dropdown: Allows you to switch between [workspaces](#workspaces) or create a new one.
- The application dropdown: Allows you to choose which application you want to manage or create a new one.
- The instance dropdown: Allows you to switch between your [development and production instances](#instances).
- The [`<UserButton />`](/docs/reference/components/user/user-button): Allows you to manage your account and sign out.

We try to make the Clerk Dashboard as intuitive as possible, but if you ever need help or have any feedback, you can always reach out to our [support team](https://clerk.com/support).

## Workspaces

Workspaces are a way to group applications and resources together.

When you create a Clerk account in the Clerk Dashboard, you are automatically added to a workspace called your **Personal workspace**. You can edit the name of this workspace, along with other settings, on the Clerk Dashboard's [**Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/settings) page.

When you visit the Clerk Dashboard, a workspace is always selected/active. The last workspace used will be selected by default. You can switch between workspaces or create a new one by selecting the workspace dropdown in the top-left of the Clerk Dashboard.

Each workspace can have a **team** with multiple members. You can invite team members to a workspace by visiting the [**Team**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/team) page and then selecting **Invite user**. Each team member can have a different [role](#roles-in-a-workspace), which determines their access levels and permissions within the workspace.

### Roles in a workspace

Clerk distinguishes between different roles to help manage team members' access levels and permissions within an organization. Each role within Clerk is assigned specific permissions that determine what actions a member can perform. When assigning roles to team members, consider the following:

- What resources does this team member need to access?
- What actions does this team member need to perform?
- What level of system configuration access is required?

The available roles are:

- [**Admin**](#admin): Full access to organization management, application configuration, and billing.
- [**Member**](#member): Manage application configuration, API keys, and billing, cannot impersonate users/organizations or manage organization members.
- [**Support**](#support): User support with read-only application configuration, can impersonate users/organizations and manage restrictions.

#### Admin

The **Admin** role is the highest level of authority within an organization, possessing comprehensive access and control over all settings and resources.

**Key responsibilities:**

- Oversee and manage all organizational resources and applications
- Modify organization settings, including billing and member roles
- Access and modify all applications, including their settings, API keys, and domains

**Access and permissions:**

**Admins** have unrestricted access to all organizational functionalities, can modify all settings, and change other members' roles. Concretely, the **Admin** role:

- Can manage workspace members
- Can manage applications
- Can manage application configuration
- Can impersonate and ban/unban users
- Can manage API keys
- Can manage restrictions _(allowlist, blocklist, waitlist)_
- Can manage billing

#### Member

The **Member** role provides access to application management functions while maintaining separation from user-level operations.

**Key responsibilities:**

- Create and manage applications within the workspace
- Set up integrations and manage application-specific configurations
- Handle API keys and adjust application settings

**Access and permissions:**

The **Member** role is for team members who need application access without the ability to interact directly with end users. Concretely, the **Member** role:

- Can manage applications
- Can manage application configuration
- Can manage billing
- Can manage API keys
- Can ban/unban users
- Can manage restrictions _(allowlist, blocklist, waitlist)_
- Cannot manage workspace members
- Cannot impersonate users
- Cannot manage billing

#### Support

The **Support** role provides tools to assist users and organizations while preventing modifications to sensitive application configurations.

**Key responsibilities:**

- Provide direct user and organization support and troubleshooting
- Impersonate users/organizations for issue resolution and debugging
- Manage restrictions including allowlists, waitlists, and blocklists

**Access and permissions:**

**Support** team members have read-only access to application configurations, ensuring they can view necessary information for troubleshooting without the ability to modify critical settings. They cannot access or modify API keys or billing information. Concretely, **Support** team members:

- Can view application configuration
- Can impersonate users
- Can ban/unban users
- Can manage restrictions _(allowlist, blocklist, waitlist)_
- Cannot manage workspace members
- Cannot manage applications
- Cannot modify application configuration
- Cannot view API keys
- Cannot manage billing

### Create additional workspaces

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select **Create workspace**. A modal will open.
1. Complete the form. Workspace slugs are unique across all instances, so common naming conventions might already be in use by another instance.
1. Select **Create workspace**. The newly created workspace will be set the active workspace.

### Invite team members to your workspace

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select **Manage**. You will be redirected to the Team settings page of the active workspace.
1. Select **Invite user**.
1. In the **Invite user** form, enter the email of the user you want to invite and select the [role](#roles-in-a-workspace) to assign.
1. Select **Invite**.

### Transfer ownership of an application

Transferring an application between two workspaces does not cause disruptions. Your API keys, settings, domains, and other configurations remain unchanged, and your app will continue to function as expected. Only the ownership is updated, so no further action is needed to maintain continuity for existing users.

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), open the workspace dropdown and select the workspace that contains the application you want to transfer.
1. Locate and select the application to transfer.
1. Navigate to the application's [**Settings**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/settings) page.
1. On the right-hand side of the page, select **Transfer ownership**. A modal will open.
1. Complete the form and select **Transfer ownership**. The page will redirect to the **Applications** page and show the transferred application.

#### Transfer to a workspace without billing information

**An application with an existing paid subscription can only be transferred to a workspace with active billing information**. You can set up billing information on the receiving workspace without being charged.

To set up a payment method without being charged:

1. In the top-left of the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com), select the workspace dropdown.
1. Select the workspace that you want to transfer the application to.
1. Select the workspace dropdown again, and select **Manage**.
1. In the top menu bar, select **Billing**, then select **Upgrade to unlimited members**.
1. Add your billing information. **You will not be charged immediately**. Doing this just ensures billing information is added to the workspace.
1. Once that billing information is added, you will be able to transfer your Clerk app to the receiving workspace.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a temporary solution for this issue. Clerk is actively working to improve this process.

## Instances

Each Clerk application can have two different instances: `Development` or `Production`. The names are self-explanatory, but you can learn more about the differences between the two in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/development/managing-environments).

When you create a new application, it is automatically provisioned with a `Development` instance. You can switch between instances or provision your `Production` instance by selecting the instance dropdown in the top-left of the Clerk Dashboard.
