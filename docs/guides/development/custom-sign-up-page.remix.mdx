By default, the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in) component handles signing in and signing up, but if you'd like to have a dedicated sign-up page, this guide shows you how to use the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-up) component to build a custom sign-up page.

To set up a single sign-in-or-up page, follow the [custom sign-in-or-up page guide](/docs/remix/guides/development/custom-sign-in-or-up-page).

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-up) component on a dedicated sign-up page using the [Remix optional route](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/route/route#optional-segments).

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-up.$.tsx' }}
  import { SignUp } from '@clerk/remix'

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignUp />
  }
  ```

  ## Configure your sign-up page

  <Tabs items={["SSR Mode", "SPA Mode"]}>
    <Tab>
      - Set the `CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` environment variable to tell Clerk where the `<SignUp />` component is being hosted.
      - Set `CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users visit the `/sign-up` route directly.
      - Set `CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL` as a fallback URL incase users select the 'Already have an account? Sign in' link at the bottom of the component.

      Learn more about these environment variables and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/development/customize-redirect-urls).

      ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
      CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
      CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
      CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
      ```
    </Tab>

    <Tab>
      - Set the `signUpUrl` property to your `ClerkApp` options to tell Clerk where the `<SignUp />` component is being hosted.
      - Set the `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl` property to a fallback URL incase users visit the `/sign-up` route directly.
      - Set the `signInFallbackRedirectUrl` property to a fallback URL incase users select the 'Already have an account? Sign in' link at the bottom of the component.

      Learn more about these environment variables and how to customize Clerk's redirect behavior in the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/development/customize-redirect-urls).

      ```ts {{ filename: 'app/root.tsx' }}
      export default ClerkApp(App, {
        publishableKey: PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
        signUpUrl: '/sign-up',
        signUpFallbackRedirectUrl: '/',
        signInFallbackRedirectUrl: '/',
      })
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  ## Visit your new page

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  Visit your new custom page locally at [localhost:3000/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/sign-up).
