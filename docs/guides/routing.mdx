# Routing in Clerk

Clerk uses [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) to handle routing in your application.

For example, say a user uses their email address to fill out the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) form. Once they submit the form, they are redirected to `/sign-up/verify-email-address` which renders Clerk's UI for verifying a user's email address. This redirect was powered by React Router.

React Router offers many different routers to handle routing in your application. Clerk abstracts this complexity away from you, and provides a simple API to handle routing in your application.

Clerk's authentication, user, and organization [components](/docs/components/overview) accept a `routing` prop in order to define the routing strategy. There are three routing strategies that can be passed:

- [`path`](#path-routing)
- [`hash`](#hash-routing)
- [`virtual`](#virtual-routing)

## `path` routing

`path` routing uses [`createBrowserRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router) under the hood, which uses the DOM History API to update the URL and manage the history stack. This is the most common routing strategy used in web applications.

In Clerk applications that use the Next.js or Remix SDKs, `path` routing is set *by default*, as these frameworks support server-side routing out-of-the-box. There is no need to pass the `routing` or `path` props to Clerk components.

## `hash` routing

`hash` routing uses [`createHashRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-hash-router) under the hood. Functionally, this router does the same thing as `createBrowserRouter`, except instead of using normal URL's, it will use the hash (#) portion of the URL to manage the "application URL". This is useful for single-page applications that don't want to deal with server-side routing.

In Clerk applications that use any SDK other than Next.js or Remix, `hash` routing is set *by default*.

## `virtual` routing

`virtual` routing uses [`createMemoryRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-memory-router) under the hood. Instead of using the browser's history, a memory router manages its own history stack in memory. This is useful for modals and other UI components that don't need to change the URL. **This option is considered experimental.**
