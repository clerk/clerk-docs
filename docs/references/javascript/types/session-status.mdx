# `SessionStatus`

The `SessionStatus` enum is used to indicate the status of a session.

```tsx {{ prettier: false }}
type SessionStatus = "abandoned" | "active" | "ended" | "expired" | "removed" | "replaced" | "revoked";
```

## Properties

| - | - |
| `abandoned` | The session was abandoned client-side. |
| `active` | The session is valid and all activity is allowed. |
| `ended` | The user signed out of the session, but the [`Session`][session-ref] remains in the [`Client`][client-ref] object. |
| `expired` | The period of allowed activity for this session has passed. |
| `removed` | The user signed out of the session and the [`Session`][session-ref] was removed from the [`Client`][client-ref] object. |
| `replaced` | The session has been replaced by another one, but the [`Session`][session-ref] remains in the [`Client`][client-ref] object. |
| `revoked` | The application ended the session and the [`Session`][session-ref] was removed from the [`Client`][client-ref] object. |
