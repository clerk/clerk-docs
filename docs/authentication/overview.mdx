# Sign-up & Sign-in

Clerk supports multiple authentication strategies so that you can implement the strategy that makes sense for *your* users. You can use Clerk's [hosted pages](/docs/authentication/using-clerk-hosted-pages), [pre-built components](/docs/authentication/components/overview), or [build your own custom flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview).

## Configuration

Clerk's configuration settings affect how the users of your application can [sign up](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-options) and [sign in](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-in-options) and which attributes are editable via their user profile. You can also manage [user sessions](/docs/authentication/configuration/session-options), [control who gets access](/docs/authentication/configuration/allowlist) to your application, and [customize the email & SMS messages](/docs/authentication/configuration/email-options) that are sent by Clerk during authentication flows. All of these settings can be found under the **User & Authentication** section in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/).
