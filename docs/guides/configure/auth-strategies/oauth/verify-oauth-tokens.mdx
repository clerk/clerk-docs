title: Verify OAuth tokens with Clerk
description: Learn how to verify OAuth tokens in your applications.
---

If you are building an application that uses Clerk and would like to incorporate OAuth, you'll want to ensure that after the [client](!oauth-client) gets an [OAuth access token](!oauth-access-token), they can use it to make authenticated requests into your app (the [resource service](!oauth-resource-service)) using the token.

<Include src="_partials/machine-token-pricing-callout" />

Clerk's SDKs support this through the `acceptsToken` parameter that can be used in Clerk's route protection functions, such as [`auth()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth), [`auth.protect()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth#auth-protect), and [`authenticateRequest()`](/docs/reference/backend/authenticate-request).

For examples and best practices on verifying OAuth tokens with Clerk SDKs, see our framework-specific guides for:

- [Next.js](/docs/guides/development/verifying-oauth-access-tokens)
- [React Router](/docs/guides/development/verifying-oauth-access-tokens)
- [Tanstack React Start](/docs/guides/development/verifying-oauth-access-tokens)

You can also verify tokens manually via the [Clerk REST API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/oauth-access-tokens/post/oauth_applications/access_tokens/verify){{ target: '_blank' }}. Ensure you have your Clerk Secret Key on hand as you'll need to include it in the `Authorization` header; it can be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

```sh {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
curl https://api.clerk.com/oauth_applications/access_tokens/verify \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-clerk-secret-key-here' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "access_token": "your-oauth-token-here" }'
```
