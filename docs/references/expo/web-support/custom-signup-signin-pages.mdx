title: Build sign in and sign up pages with prebuilt components on web
description: Learn how to add custom sign-in and sign-up pages to your Expo app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) and [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) prebuilt components in order to build custom sign-in and sign-up pages for your Expo **web** app.

This guide uses [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) and the [platform-specific extensions](https://docs.expo.dev/router/create-pages/#platform-specific-extensions) to build the sign-up and sign-in pages specifically for the **web** platform.

<Steps>
  ### Build a sign-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component.

  ```tsx filename="/app/sign-up.web.tsx"
  import { SignUp } from '@clerk/clerk-expo/web'

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignUp />
  }
  ```

  ### Build a sign-in page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component.

  ```tsx filename="/app/sign-in.web.tsx"
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/clerk-expo/web'

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignIn />
  }
  ```

  ### Visit your new pages

  To run your project, use the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash filename="terminal"
    npm run web
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    yarn web
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    pnpm web
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom pages locally at [localhost:8081/sign-in](http://localhost:8081/sign-in) and [localhost:8081/sign-up](http://localhost:8081/sign-up).
