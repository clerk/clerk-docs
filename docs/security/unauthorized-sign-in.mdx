Clerk identifies attempts by unauthorized individuals or entities to access a user's account.

## Detecting unauthorized sign-ins

Whenever a sign-in attempt is completed from an unfamiliar device, Clerk sends an email notification to the account owner with information about the newly created session.

The account owner can then choose to immediately revoke this session.

To configure this feature:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active).
1. In the secondary navigation header, select **Configure**.
1. From the navigation sidebar, select **Emails** under the **Customization** menu group.
1. Locate the **New client sign in** email template and click on the toggle next to it in order to disable the feature.
1. You can customize the email content, similar to how you can customize the rest of the email templates. See [Email and SMS templates](/docs/authentication/configuration/email-sms-templates) for more information.

## Email notification for unauthorized access

The email notification users receive for unauthorized sign-ins varies depending on the instance's configuration and the application's billing plan.

By default, the email includes information about the unauthorized sign-in attempt, such as device type, operating system, IP address, location, and the sign-in method used. If you've set a support email for your app, Clerk will add instructions for the user to contact the app administrator.

For supported instances, the email might also include a button allowing users to sign out from the unrecognized device. Clicking this button immediately revokes the session.

Customize the unauthorized sign-in email notification:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active).
1. In the secondary navigation header, select **Configure**.
1. From the navigation sidebar, select **Emails** under the **Customization** menu group.
1. Locate the **New client sign in** email template and select it.
1. Edit the email template and apply your changes.

## Session revocation for unauthorized sign-ins

> [!WARNING]
> This feature isn't available in production for free plans. However, you can try it out free in development mode. For more information, see the [pricing](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} page.

For apps that support it, users can immediately revoke unauthorized sign-ins directly from the email notification. A single click will revoke the suspicious session and redirect the user to a confirmation page. The contents of the confirmation page depend on the instance's configuration.
- Enabling [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview): The user is redirected to the [Unauthorized sign-in](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview#unauthorized-sign-in) page, where content can be customized based on the app's theme.
- Disabling Account Portal: Users see a plain text confirmation of successful session revocation.

In either case, after revoking, users must sign in again unless they have an active session on their device.

You can customize the URL path of the Unauthorized sign in page:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active).
1. In the secondary navigation header, select **Configure**.
1. From the navigation sidebar, select **Paths** under the **Developer** menu group.
1. Edit the Unauthorized sign in page path and apply your changes.
