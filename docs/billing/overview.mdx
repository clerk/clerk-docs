## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### Can I use an existing Stripe account with Clerk billing?

Unfortunately, there is no way to use an existing business entity with Clerk billing.

### Can I see subscriptions in my Stripe account?

Clerk billing does not use Stripe products, prices, subscriptions, etc. Clerk manages plans and subscriptions/subscription items, and only uses Stripe for payment processing. You will still be able to see customer information, as well as payment information in your Stripe account.

### Is Clerk a Merchant of Record (MoR) for transactions?

No, Clerk does not provide this service.

### Are payment methods from all countries supported?

Unforunately, credits card from India are not supported at this time due to limitations when using Stripe was the payment processor: [https://docs.stripe.com/india-recurring-payments](https://docs.stripe.com/india-recurring-payments). We hope to add support for other payment processors in the future.

### Can I update the price of an existing plan?

If the plan already has users or organizations actively subscribed to it, the price cannot be changed. We hope to support a more comprehensive solution in the future, but for now a new plan would have to be created and users/organizations migrated to that new plan. Each plan can be toggled to be publicly visible or not, as well as renamed, and these options can help with the migration process.
