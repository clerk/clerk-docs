> [!TIP]
> If you have a `<Link>` tag on a public page that points to a protected page that returns a `400`-level error, like a `401`, the data prefetch will fail because it will be redirected to the sign-in page and throw a confusing error in the console. To prevent this behavior, disable prefetching by adding `prefetch={false}` to the `<Link>` component.
