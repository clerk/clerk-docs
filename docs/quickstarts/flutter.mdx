  ## Create an Flutter project

  To get started using Clerk with Flutter, create a new empty Flutter project using the `flutter` CLI or your favorite IDE Flutter extension.

  ## Install the Clerk Flutter SDK

  The Clerk Flutter SDK is distributed via pub.dev. To add the Clerk Flutter SDK to your project run `flutter pub add clerk_flutter` or manuall add `clerk_flutter` to your pubspec.yaml and run `flutter pub get`

  ## Configure Clerk

  1. Import Clerk
  2. Wrap your app in the ClerkAuth widget and supply your publishable key to the ClerkAuthConfig widget.
  3. Use the ClerkErrorListener widget to catch Clerk errors
  4. Use the ClerkAuthBuilder widget to conditionally render content
  5. Use the ClerkAuthentication prebuilt UI widget to have users sign in and up
  6. Use the ClerkUserButton prebuilt UI widget to allow logged in users to manage their account

  ```dart {{ filename: 'lib/main.dart, mark: [2, 6, [10, 21]] }}
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
  import 'package:clerk_flutter/clerk_flutter.dart';

  void main() {
    runApp(const MainApp());
  }

  class MainApp extends StatelessWidget {
    const MainApp({super.key});

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return ClerkAuth(
        config: ClerkAuthConfig(publishableKey: 'pk_test...'),
        child: MaterialApp(
          theme: ThemeData.light(),
          debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
          home: Scaffold(
            body: SafeArea(
              child: ClerkErrorListener(
                child: ClerkAuthBuilder(
                  signedInBuilder: (context, authState) {
                    return const ClerkUserButton();
                  },
                  signedOutBuilder: (context, authState) {
                    return const ClerkAuthentication();
                  },
                ),
              ),
            ),
          ),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

  ## Create your first user

  1. Run your project using `flutter run` or your favorite IDE.
  2. Click "Sign up" and authenticate to create your first user.
