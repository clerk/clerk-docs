# `$clerkStore`

The `$clerkStore` store provides access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object. This provides access to some methods that are not available in other stores.

<Callout type="warning">
  This is intended to be used for advanced use cases, like building a completely custom OAuth flow or as an escape hatch for getting access to the `Clerk` object.
</Callout>

## How to use the `$clerkStore` store

```tsx filename="components/sign-in.tsx"
import { useStore } from '@nanostores/react';
import { $clerkStore } from '@clerk/astro/client';

export default function Home() {
  const clerk = useStore($clerkStore);

  return <button onClick={() => clerk.openSignIn({})}>Sign in</button>;
};
```
