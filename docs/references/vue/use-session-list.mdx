## How to use the `useSessionList()` composable

The following example demonstrates how to use the `useSessionList()` composable to retrieve a list of sessions that have been registered on the client device. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state, and the `sessions` property is used to display the number of times the user has visited the page.

```vue {{ filename: 'home.vue' }}
<script setup>
import { useSessionList } from '@clerk/vue'

const { isLoaded, sessions } = useSessionList()
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">
    <!-- handle loading state -->
  </div>

  <div v-else>
    <p>
      Welcome back. You have been here
      {{ sessions.length }} times before.
    </p>
  </div>
</template>
```
