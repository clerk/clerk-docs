# Unlock user accounts from the Clerk Dashboard

<Callout type="info">
This feature is applicable to user accounts that use [passwords](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) or [backup codes](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/multi-factor).
</Callout>

Users with admin roles can override lockouts through the Clerk Dashboard.

1. In your Clerk Dashboard, navigate to **[Users](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=users)**.
2. Locate the locked user by looking for a "locked" badge next to their username/email. 
3. Open the admin menu by selecting the icon that looks like three stacked dots.
4. Select **Unlock** to unlock the user account.
