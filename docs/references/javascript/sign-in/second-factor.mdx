These are all methods on the [`SignIn`][signin-ref] class that allow you to handle the second factor of a multi-factor authentication flow.

## `prepareSecondFactor()`

Begins the second factor verification process. This step is optional in order to complete a sign in.

A common scenario for the second step verification (2FA) is to require a one-time code (OTP) as proof of identity. This is determined by the accepted `strategy` parameter values. Each authentication identifier supports different strategies.

> [!NOTE]
> While the `phone_code` strategy requires preparation, the `totp` strategy does not - the user can directly attempt the second factor verification in that case.

```typescript
function prepareSecondFactor(params: PrepareSecondFactorParams): Promise<SignIn>
```

### `PrepareSecondFactorParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'phone_code' | 'totp'`

  The strategy to be used for second factor verification. Possible `strategy` values are currently:

  - `phone_code`: User will receive a one-time authentication code in their phone, via SMS. At least one phone number should be on file for the user.
</Properties>

### Returns

| Type | Description |
| - | - |
| <code>Promise\<[SignIn][signin-ref]></code> | A `Promise` which resolves with a [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object. Check the `secondFactorVerification` attribute for the status of the second factor verification process. |

## `attemptSecondFactor()`

Attempts to complete the second factor verification process (2FA). This step is optional in order to complete a sign in.

For the `phone_code` strategy, make sure that a verification has already been prepared before you call this method, by first calling `SignIn.prepareSecondFactor`. Depending on the strategy that was selected when the verification was prepared, the method parameters should be different.

The `totp` strategy can directly be attempted, without the need for preparation.

```typescript
function attemptSecondFactor(params: AttemptSecondFactorParams): Promise<SignIn>
```

### `AttemptSecondFactorParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'phone_code' | 'totp'`

  The strategy to be used for second factor verification. Possible `strategy` values are

  - `phone_code`: User will receive a one-time authentication code in their phone, via SMS. At least one phone number should be on file for the user.
  - `totp`: User must provide a 6-digit TOTP code generated by their authenticator app. The user will need to have created a TOTP secret beforehand so as to register it on their authentictor app via QR code, URI or even entering the secret itself.

  - `code`
  - `string`

  {/* Comment to prevent lists from being merged into one */}

  - For the `phone_code` strategy: The one-time code that was sent to the user as part of the prepareSecondFactor step.
  - For the `totp` strategy: The TOTP generated by the user's authenticator app.
</Properties>

### Returns

| Type | Description |
| - | - |
| <code>Promise\<[SignIn][signin-ref]></code> | This method returns a `Promise` which resolves with a [`SignIn`][signin-ref] object. Check the `secondFactorVerification` attribute for the status of the second factor verification process. |
