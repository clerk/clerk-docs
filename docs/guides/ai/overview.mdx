Clerk provides support for building AI-powered applications with secure authentication. Whether you're building an MCP server that allows AI agents to access user data, or using AI-powered development tools to build applications with Clerk, these guides cover everything you need to get started.

## AI prompts

Clerk's AI prompt library provides curated prompts to help you work more efficiently with AI-powered development tools like Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and more. These prompts guide AI assistants in helping you implement Clerk's features correctly.

To learn more, see the [AI prompts](/docs/guides/ai/prompts) guide.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The **[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)** is an open standard that lets large language model (LLM), like Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, VS Code, Zeb, and other clients **securely access user data from external services** with the user's permission. Instead of asking users to sign in separately, MCP allows these AI apps to request permission to access specific data, such as emails or private GitHub repositories, directly through the app being used.

There are two parties involved in MCP - "client" and "server". In web development, the terms "client" and "server" often refer to the frontend (browser) and backend (web server). However, in this context, these terms have different meanings:

- The "client" is the LLM application that wants to access another service on a user's behalf. For example, Claude would be the "client" if it wants to get access to Gmail.
- The "server" is the system that hosts the protected resources the client wants to access. In this example, this would be Gmail. This is sometimes referred to as the "resource server" or "MCP server".

MCP servers often need to access user data from various sources on behalf of AI apps. This requires robust OAuth flows with proper consent management, token verification, and security controls, which Clerk supports. The combination of dynamic client registration (for registering MCP servers programmatically), the consent screen (for secure user authorization), and comprehensive SDK support makes Clerk an ideal authorization server for MCP implementations.

## Use Clerk's MCP server

Clerk provides its own MCP server that helps AI coding assistants provide accurate SDK snippets and implementation patterns. This is useful when building authentication features with Clerk in AI tools like Cursor, Claude, or VS Code. Learn how to [connect to Clerk's MCP server](/docs/guides/ai/mcp/clerk-mcp-server).

## Build your own MCP server
