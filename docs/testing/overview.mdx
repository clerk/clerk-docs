# Testing

Testing is an important part of every application. Clerk has built some helpers to make testing your application with Clerk easier, with more on the way. Each framework may require a slightly different setup. If you're having trouble getting testing to work properly, [send us a message](https://clerk.com/support) and we'll be able to help.

## Testing with one time passcodes

To avoid sending an email or SMS message with a one time passcode (OTP) during testing, you can use a faux email address or phone number that has a fixed code. Read the complete documentation [here](https://clerk.com/docs/testing/test-emails-and-phones).

## End-to-end (E2E) testing

Currently, end-to-end testing is not fully supported with Clerk due to tests getting detected as bot traffic. We are currently working on a solution for this.
