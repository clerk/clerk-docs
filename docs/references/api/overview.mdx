description: Access Clerk's frontend and backend API reference documentation.
---

Clerk's SDKs are built on top of Clerk's Frontend API (FAPI) and Backend API (BAPI). Usually, you won't need to interact with these APIs directly as Clerk's SDKs abstract away the complexity and handle the logic and flows for you. However, if you need to interact with Clerk's APIs directly, their reference documentation is available:

- [The Clerk Frontend API](/docs/references/api/frontend-api): meant to be accessed from a browser or native environment.
- [The Clerk Backend API](/docs/references/api/backend-api): meant to be accessed by backend servers.
