title: '`useSignUp()`'
description: Access and manage the current user's sign-up state in your React application with Clerk's useSignUp() hook.
---

The `useSignUp()` hook provides access to the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-up attempt and manage the sign-up flow. You can use this to create a [custom sign-up flow](/docs/custom-flows/overview#sign-up-flow).

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `isLoaded`
  - `boolean`

    A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads.

  ---

  - `setActive()`
  - <code>(params: [SetActiveParams](#set-active-params)) => Promise\<void></code>

  A function that sets the active session.

  ---

  - `signUp`
  - [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up)

  An object that contains the current sign-up attempt status and methods to create a new sign-up attempt.
</Properties>

### `SetActiveParams`

<Properties>
  - `session`
  - <code>[Session](/docs/references/javascript/session) | string | null</code>

  The session resource or session ID (string version) to be set as active. If `null`, the current session is deleted.

  ---

  - `organization`
  - <code>[Organization](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) | string | null</code>

  The organization resource or organization ID/slug (string version) to be set as active in the current session. If `null`, the currently active organization is removed as active.

  ---

  - `beforeEmit?`
  - `(session?: Session | null) => void | Promise<any>`

  Callback run just before the active session and/or organization is set to the passed object. Can be used to hook up for pre-navigation actions.
</Properties>

## How to use the `useSignUp()` hook

### Check the current state of a sign-up

The following example uses the `useSignUp()` hook to access the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) object, which contains the current sign-up attempt status and methods to create a new sign-up attempt. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state.

```tsx {{ filename: 'src/pages/SignUpPage.tsx' }}
import { useSignUp } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

export default function SignUpPage() {
  const { isLoaded, signUp } = useSignUp()

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null
  }

  return <div>The current sign-up attempt status is {signUp?.status}.</div>
}
```

### `SignUp` status values

The `status` property of the `SignUp` object can be one of the following values:

<Properties>
  - `complete`
  - `string`

  The user has been created and the custom flow can proceed to `setActive()` to create a session.

  ---

  - `abandoned`
  - `string`

  The sign-up attempt will be abandoned if it was started more than 24 hours previously.

  ---

  - `missing_requirements`
  - `string`

  A requirement is missing from the [Email, Phone, Username](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) settings. For example, in the Clerk Dashboard, the **Password** setting is required but a password wasn't provided in the custom flow.
</Properties>

### Create a custom sign-up flow with `useSignUp()`

The `useSignUp()` hook can also be used to build fully custom sign-up flows, if Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow. Different sign-up flows include email and password, email and phone codes, email links, and multifactor (MFA). To learn more about using the `useSignUp()` hook to create custom flows, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/custom-flows/overview).
