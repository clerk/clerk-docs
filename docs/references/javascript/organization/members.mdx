# Organization membership methods

These methods on the [`Organization`](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) object allow you to manage the members of an organization.

## `getMemberships()`

Retrieve the members of the currently active organization.

```typescript
function getMemberships(params?: GetMembersParams): Promise<ClerkPaginatedResponse<OrganizationMembership>>;
```

### `GetMembersParams`
