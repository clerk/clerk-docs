When building a resource server that needs to accept and verify OAuth access tokens issued by Clerk, it's crucial to verify these tokens on your backend to ensure the request is coming from an authenticated client.

<Include src="_partials/machine-token-pricing-callout" />

Clerk provides a built-in [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/react-router/get-auth) function that supports token validation via the `acceptsToken` parameter. This lets you specify which type(s) of token your API route should accept in your React Router app.

By default, `acceptsToken` is set to `session_token`, which means OAuth tokens will **not** be accepted unless explicitly configured. You can pass either a **single token type** or an **array of token types** to `acceptsToken`. To learn more about the supported token types, see the [`getAuth()` parameters documentation](/docs/references/react-router/get-auth#parameters).

## Example 1: Accepting a single token type

In the following example, the `acceptsToken` parameter is set to only accept `oauth_token`s.

- If the token is invalid or missing, `auth()` will return `null` for `subject` and other properties, and the request will be rejected with a `401` response.
- If the token is valid, it returns the authenticated user's subject and their associated scopes for use in the application logic.

```tsx
import type { LoaderFunction } from 'react-router-dom'
import { getAuth } from '@clerk/react-router/ssr.server'

export const clerkAuth: LoaderFunction = async ({ request }) => {
  const { subject, scopes } = await getAuth(request, {
    acceptsToken: 'oauth_token',
  })

  // If getAuth() returns null, the token is invalid
  if (!subject) {
    throw new Response('OAuth access token is invalid', { status: 401 })
  }

  return { subject, scopes }
}
```

## Example 2: Accepting any token type

In the following example, the `acceptsToken` parameter is set to accept any token type.

- If the token is a `session_token`, it logs that the request is from a user session.
- Otherwise, it logs that the request uses a machine token and specifies its type.

{/* TODO: I thought it can also be a oauth_token or api_key? */}

```tsx
import { getAuth } from '@clerk/react-router/ssr.server'
import type { Route } from './+types/profile'

export async function loader(args: Route.LoaderArgs) {
  const { tokenType } = await getAuth(args, { acceptsToken: 'any' })

  if (tokenType === 'session_token') {
    console.log('this is session token from a user')
  } else {
    console.log('this is some other type of machine token')
    console.log('more specifically, a ' + tokenType)
  }

  return {}
}
```
