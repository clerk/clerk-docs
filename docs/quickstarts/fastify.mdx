Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Fastify backend for secure user authentication and management. This guide uses TypeScript and allows you to choose your frontend framework.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Fastify is only compatible with Next.js versions 13.4 and below](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-nextjs). If you're using a newer version of Next.js, consider using a different backend framework that supports the latest Next.js features.
>
> This guide uses ECMAScript Modules (ESM). To use ESM in your project, you must include `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`.

<Steps>
  ### Install `@clerk/fastify`

  [Clerk's Fastify SDK](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/tree/main/packages/fastify) provides a range of backend utilities to simplify user authentication and management in your application.

  To get started using Clerk with Fastify, add the SDK to your project:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm install @clerk/fastify
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn add @clerk/fastify
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm add @clerk/fastify
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ### Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env.local` file. These keys can always be
    retrieved from the [API
    Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page of your
    Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard.
    1. In the navigation sidebar, select [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys).
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk publishable and secret key.
    1. Paste your keys into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ### Configure `clerkPlugin` for all routes

  The `clerkPlugin` is a Fastify plugin provided by Clerk to integrate authentication into your Fastify application. To ensure that Clerk's authentication and user management features are applied across your Fastify application, configure the `clerkPlugin` to handle all routes or limit it to specific ones.

  The following example registers the plugin for all routes. To register the plugin for specific routes only, refer to the [**Using Clerk for specific pages only**](/docs/quickstarts/fastify#using-clerk-for-specific-routes-only) section.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > The `dotenv/config` module must be imported before any Clerk modules. This order is important because Clerk instances are created during the import process and rely on environment variables, such as API keys, to be initialized correctly. For more details, refer to the [Fastify docs](https://fastify.dev/docs/latest/Guides/Getting-Started/#loading-order-of-your-plugins).

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts' }}
  import 'dotenv/config'
  import Fastify from 'fastify'
  import { clerkPlugin } from '@clerk/fastify'

  const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true })

  fastify.register(clerkPlugin)

  const start = async () => {
    try {
      await fastify.listen({ port: 8080 })
    } catch (error) {
      fastify.log.error(error)
      process.exit(1)
    }
  }

  start()
  ```

  ### Use `getAuth()` to access the auth state and protect routes

  The following example uses [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth){{ target: '_blank' }} to retrieve the `userId`, which is used to protect the route and is passed to [`clerkClient.users.getUser()`](/docs/references/backend/user/get-user){{ target: '_blank' }} to retrieve the current user's `User` object.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts' }}
  import 'dotenv/config'
  import Fastify from 'fastify'
  import { clerkClient, clerkPlugin, getAuth } from '@clerk/fastify'

  const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true })

  fastify.register(clerkPlugin)

  fastify.get('/', async (request, reply) => {
    const { userId } = getAuth(request)

    // Protect the route from unauthenticated users
    if (!userId) {
      return reply.code(403).send({ error: 'Unauthorized request.' })
    }

    const user = userId ? await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId) : null

    return reply.send({
      message: 'User retrieved successfully.',
      user,
    })
  })

  const start = async () => {
    try {
      await fastify.listen({ port: 8080 })
    } catch (error) {
      fastify.log.error(error)
      process.exit(1)
    }
  }

  start()
  ```
</Steps>

### Configure `clerkPlugin` for specific routes

If you want to use Clerk for specific pages only, you can register the plugin for specific routes. In the following example, the routes are split into protected and public routes.

```ts {{ filename: 'index.ts' }}
import 'dotenv/config'
import Fastify, { FastifyPluginCallback } from 'fastify'
import { clerkClient, clerkPlugin, getAuth } from '@clerk/fastify'

const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true })

const protectedRoutes: FastifyPluginCallback = (instance, options, done) => {
  instance.register(clerkPlugin)

  instance.get('/protected', async (request, reply) => {
    const { userId } = getAuth(request)

    // Protect the route from unauthenticated users
    if (!userId) {
      return reply.code(403).send({ message: 'Access denied. Authentication required.' })
    }

    const user = await clerkClient.users.getUser(userId)

    // Only authenticated users will see the following message
    reply.send({ message: 'This is a protected route.', user })
  })

  done()
}

const publicRoutes: FastifyPluginCallback = (instance, options, done) => {
  instance.get('/', async (request, reply) => {
    reply.send({ message: 'This is a public route.' })
  })

  done()
}

fastify.register(protectedRoutes)
fastify.register(publicRoutes)

const start = async () => {
  try {
    await fastify.listen({ port: 8080 })
  } catch (error) {
    fastify.log.error(error)
    process.exit(1)
  }
}

start()
```
