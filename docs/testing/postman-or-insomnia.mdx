# Testing with Postman or Insomnia

Postman and Insomnia are powerful tools used to test API's, validate their behavior, and automate testing tasks. Basic testing with these tools is similar, and this guide will help you get started with either option.

## Generate Long Lived JWT Template

The standard token issued by Clerk expires after 60 seconds. Clerk SDKs handle refreshing the token regularly so that the authentication state is kept up to date. Because this token expires quickly, it isn't very useful when trying to test with Postman or Insomnia.

You will want to create a long lived [JWT Template](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates) to be used in Postman or Insomnia. To do so, navigate to the [JWT Templates](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=jwt-templates) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Click on the **New template** button and select the **Blank** template.

Give your template a unique name, such as *'testing-template'*. Set the **Token Lifetime** to a value that suits your needs, or use the maximum of 315360000 seconds (10 years). If your normal token has Claims, then you can add the same Claims to your JWT Template.

## Fetch Long Lived Token

Visit your frontend that is using the same Clerk Application and instance that you want to test. Log in as a user. The user that you log in as will be the user you test with in Postman or Insomnia. You can create several tokens for several different users. Once you have logged in, open your Dev Tools and go to the **Console** tab. Enter the following command:

```
await window.Clerk.session.getToken()
```

## Using Postman or Insomnia

Open Postman/Insomnia and create a new request. Configure the correct method and route. In the Authorization tab, select Bearer Token. Paste the token you copied from the console as the Bearer Token. Your request will now authenticate as the user you created the token with.

## Variables

You can create a Collection in Postman or Insomnia, and inside of that Collection add Variables (Postman) or Environment Variable (Insomnia). These let you use the same token in multiple requests, and easily store tokens for multiple users. This is great for testing different features in your application by changing the token/user you are testing with. You can read more about Variables for [Postman here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) and for [Insomnia here](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/environment-variables).
