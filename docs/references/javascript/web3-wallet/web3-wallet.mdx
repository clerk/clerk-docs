# `Web3Wallet`

The `Web3Wallet` object describes a Web3 wallet address. The address can be used as a proof of identification for users.

Web3 addresses must be verified to ensure that they can be assigned to their rightful owners. The verification is completed via Web3 wallet browser extensions, such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). The `Web3Wallet3` object holds all the necessary state around the verification process.

The verification process always starts with the [`Web3Wallet.prepareVerification()`](/docs/references/javascript/web3-wallet/verification#prepare-verification) or [`signIn.prepareFirstFactor()`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/first-factor#prepare-first-factor) method, which will send the wallet address to [Clerk Frontend API](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/frontend-api) and will receive a nonce that needs to be signed by the Web3 wallet browser extension.

The second and final step involves an attempt to complete the verification by calling [`Web3Wallet.attemptVerification()`](/docs/references/javascript/web3-wallet/verification#attempt-verification) method, passing the generated signature as a parameter.
