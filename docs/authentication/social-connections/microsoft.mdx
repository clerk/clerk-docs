  - Use Microsoft Azure Entra ID to authenticate users with OAuth.
  - Protect your application from [the nOAuth exploit](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth).
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with Microsoft Azure Entra ID (formerly [Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/new-name)) allows your users to sign in and sign up to your Clerk application with their Microsoft account.

## Configure for your development instance

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for _development instances_ - no other configuration is needed. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard and go to **User & Authentication -> [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)**. In the list of **Auth Providers**, enable Microsoft and select **Save**.

## Configure for your production instance

In _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials, which includes generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your LinkedIn Developer account. Don't worry, this tutorial will walk you through that process in just a few steps.

<Steps>
  ### Create a Microsoft Entra ID app

  > [!TIP]
  > If you already have a Microsoft Entra ID app you'd like to connect to Clerk, select your app from the [Microsoft Entra ID dashboard](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and skip to [the next step in this tutorial](#get-your-client-id-and-client-secret).

  1. Under the **Azure services** section on the homepage of [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home), select **[Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview)**.
  1. In the sidebar, select **[App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/RegisteredApps)**.
  1. Select **New Registration**. You'll be taken to the **Register an application** page.
  1. Fill out the form as follows:
     1. Under **Name**, name the app whatever you'd like. "Clerk Demo App", for example.
     1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant – Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)**.
     1. Under **Redirect URI (Optional)**, select **Web**.
     1. Finally, select **Register** to submit the form.

  ### Get your client ID and client secret

  Once your Microsoft Entra ID app is created, or once you select your app from the Microsoft Entra ID dashboard, you'll be taken to its **Overview**.

  1. From your app's overview, copy the **Application (client) ID** and save it somewhere secure. It's required connecting your Microsoft Entra ID app to your Clerk app.
  1. On this same page, under **Client credentials**, select **Add a certificate or secret** to generate a Client Secret. You'll be taken to the **Certificate & secrets** page.
  1. Select the **New client secret** button. In the modal that opens, add a description and set an expiration time for your secret.
     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > When your secret expires, your social connection will stop working until you generate a new client secret and add it to your Clerk app.
  1. Copy your new client secret's **Value** and save it somewhere secure. You'll add it to your Clerk application later, alongside your client ID.

  ### Connect your Entra ID app and get your redirect URI

  1. In another tab, visit the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections).
  1. In the navigation sidebar, go to **User & Authentication > Social Connections**.
  1. In the list of **Auth Providers**, enable **Microsoft**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on. Then:
     - Under **Client ID**, add the value you copied from **Application (client) ID** in the Microsoft Entra ID dashboard.
     - Under **Client Secret**, add the client secret value you generated in the Microsoft Entra ID dashboard.
     - Copy the **Authorized redirect URI**. You need it for the final step to configure your Entra ID app.
     - Select **Save**.

  ### Enable OpenID

  To connect your Clerk app to your Microsoft app, you must set the **Authorized redirect URI** in your Microsoft Entra ID dashboard.

  1. Return to the tab where your Microsoft Entra ID dashboard is open.
  1. In the sidebar, select **Authentication**, then select **Add a platform**.
  1. Select **Single-page application**.
  1. In the **Redirect URIs** field of the modal that appears, add your Clerk application's authorized redirect URI. Do the same in the **Front-channel logout URL** field.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk application's [Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk applications out-of-the-box.

  1. In the navigation sidebar of the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal).
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:
     - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
     - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
  1. On the sign-in page, you should see **Continue with Microsoft** as an option. Use it to sign in with your Microsoft account.

  ### Secure your app against the nOAuth vulnerability

  [nOAuth](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth) is an exploit in Microsoft Entra ID OAuth applications that can lead to full account takeovers via email address spoofing. To protect users, Clerk enforces stricter checks on verified email addresses.

  For further security, Microsoft has an optional `xms_edov` claim, which provides additional context to that can be used to determine whether the returned email is verified.

  To enable this optional claim, you must:

  1. Navigate to your Azure application in the Microsoft Entra ID dashboard.
  1. In the sidebar, select **Token configuration**.
  1. Select **Add optional claim**.
  1. For the **Token type**, select **ID**. Then, in the checklist that appears, enable the `email` and `xms_pdl` claims.
  1. At the bottom of the modal, select the **Add** button. A modal will appear asking you to **Turn on the Microsoft Graph email permission**. Enable it, then select **Add** to complete the form.
     > [!NOTE]
     > At the time of writing, the `xms_edov` claim is still in preview, and may not be available for all applications. So we'll choose another one from the list and we'll rename it later on in the manifest.
  1. Repeat the previous steps, but for the **Token type**, select **Access** instead of **ID**. When you're done, the list of **Optional claims** on this page should have two claims for `email` and two for `xms_pdl`: one each for **ID** and **Access**.
  1. In the sidebar, go to **Manifest**.
  1. In the text editor, search for `"acceptMappedClaims"` and change its value from `null` to `true`.
  1. Search for `"optionalClaims"` where you'll find the `idToken` and `accessToken` arrays. Each array has an object with the name `xms_pdl`. Change the name to `xms_edov`.
  1. At the top of the page, select **Save**.
  1. In the sidebar, navigate back to **Token configuration** and confirm that the list of **Optional claims** includes two claims for `email` and two for `xms_edov`: one each for **ID** and **Access**.

  With these steps complete, Microsoft will send the `xms_edov` claim in the token, and Clerk will use it to determine whether the email is verified or not, even if it is used with Microsoft Entra ID.
</Steps>

## Limitations

- Currently Clerk supports only the `common` tenant type, which is intended for allowing sign-ins both from organization members and public Microsoft users.
  - Selecting the desired tenant type (`common`, `organizations`, `consumers` or specific tenant ID) will become available in an upcoming version of Clerk.
- Only credentials of type `secret` are currently supported (not the `certificate` type).

> [!TIP]
> If you are using [SAML with Microsoft](/docs/authentication/saml/azure), the different tenant types _are_ supported and you can disregard these limitations.
