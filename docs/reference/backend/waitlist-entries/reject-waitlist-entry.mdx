---

{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/api/endpoints/WaitlistEntryApi.ts#L65 */}

Rejects a waitlist entry by ID. Returns a [`WaitlistEntry`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-waitlist-entry) representing the rejected entry.

```ts
function reject(id: string): Promise<WaitlistEntry>
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `id`
  - `string`

  The ID of the waitlist entry to reject.
</Properties>

## Example

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

```tsx
const waitlistId = 'waitlist_123'

const response = await clerkClient.waitlistEntries.reject(waitlistId)
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `POST/waitlist_entries/{waitlist_entry_id}/reject`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/waitlist_entries/post/waitlist_entries/\{waitlist_entry_id}/reject){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
