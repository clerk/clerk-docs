description: Use Clerk's JS Backend SDK to create a waitlist entry for the given email address.
sdk: js-backend

{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/api/endpoints/WaitlistEntryApi.ts#L65 */}

Creates a [`WaitlistEntry`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-waitlist-entry) for the given email address. If the email address is already on the waitlist, no new entry will be created and the existing waitlist entry will be returned.

```ts
function create(params: WaitlistEntryCreateParams): Promise<WaitlistEntry>
```

## `WaitlistEntryCreateParams`

<Properties>
  - `emailAddress`
  - `string`

  The email address to add to the waitlist.

  ---

  - `notify?`
  - `boolean`

  Whether to send an email notification to the user. Defaults to `false`.
</Properties>

## Example

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

```tsx
const params = {
  emailAddress: 'user2@example.com',
  notify: true,
}

const response = await clerkClient.waitlistEntries.create(params)
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `POST/waitlist_entries`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/waitlist-entries/post/waitlist_entries){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
