How to setup social connection with Xero

## Overview

Adding social connection with Xero to your app with Clerk is simple - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your Xero account.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Xero developer account and a Xero OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](https://clerk.com/docs/authentication/social-connections-oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Xero developer account. To create one, [click here](https://developer.xero.com/).

## Configuring Xero social connection

First, you need to create a new OAuth2 Xero app. Click New App and fill all the required information such as the App Name, your company URL, the redirect URL, choose Web App as integration type and then click **Create app**.

Go to the [Social Connections page](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=authentication/social) and enable Xero. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Make sure the value matches the **Redirect URIs**, as shown below.
