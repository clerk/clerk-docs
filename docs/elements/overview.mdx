# Clerk Elements (beta)

<Callout type="info">
**Heads up!** Clerk Elements is currently in beta. We don't recommend that you use it in production just yet, but we'd love for you to try it out.

If you have any feedback, please reach out to beta-elements@clerk.dev.
</Callout>

Clerk Elements is a library of unstyled, composable components that can be used to build completely custom UIs on top of Clerk's APIs, without having to manage the underlying logic.

[TK: insert cool banner / header here (Derek help)]

## Getting started

Today, Clerk Elements is available for use through Clerk's Next.js SDK. As it gets closer to a stable release, support for additional frameworks will be added. Elements is available in the latest version of `@clerk/nextjs`. If your Next.js application is already using Clerk, you're ready to start building with Clerk Elements. If you're starting from scratch, follow the [Next.js quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs) to get started.

Once you've got your project set up, you can start building custom UIs with Clerk Elements. The following guides will show you how to build your own custom flows:
* [Build a sign-up flow](/docs/elements/guides/sign-up)
* [Build a sign-in flow](/docs/elements/guides/sign-in)

If you want to see what's possible with Clerk Elements, check out these pre-built examples from the Clerk team:
* [Sign-up examples](/docs/elements/examples/sign-up)
* [Sign-in examples](/docs/elements/examples/sign-in)

Finally, to learn about the avaiable components and how to use them, check out the component reference pages:
* [Common components](/docs/elements/reference/common)
* [Sign-up components](/docs/elements/reference/sign-up)
* [Sign-in components](/docs/elements/reference/sign-in)

## When should I use Clerk Elements?

Clerk Elements is the right tool if you want complete control over your UI. If customizing the prebuilt components with the [appearance prop](/docs/components/customization/overview) isn't working for you, Clerk Elements gives a deeper level of customization and control over the styles and layout.

You can also use Clerk Elements alongside the prebuilt components. Want to customize your sign-up and sign-in flows, but still want to use `<UserProfile />`? No problem!

## Highlights

### Bring your existing styles

Clerk Elements is built to give complete control over the style and layout of your authentication UI. If you use Tailwind CSS, you can pass a `className` prop to almost every single element that Clerk Elements renders. If you have an existing component library that you want to use to build your authentication UIs, Clerk Elements supports composition via an `asChild` prop.

### Component-first

We want to make it as easy to build custom UIs with Clerk as it is to drop-in our prebuilt components. With Clerk Elements, you don't need to worry about adding event listeners, triggering API calls, and managing internal state. Use a curated library of components that abstract away Clerk's internal logic, without sacrificing best practices or features that exist in the prebuilt components.

### A little bit of magic

Clerk Elements doesn't want to reinvent the wheel, but there are some primitive patterns that are crucial to building great authentication flows. Baked-in to the components are little bits of magic, like the fully accessible semented One-time-passcode (OTP) input, or instant password validation during sign up. These things can be hard to get right, but here they're baked-in.
