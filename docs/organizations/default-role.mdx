New organization members are intially assigned the [**Default** role](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#the-default-role-for-members). By default, that role is `org:member`. This role is used as a default in `<OrganizationProfile />` invitations and for organization enrollment with [verified domains](/docs/organizations/verified-domains).

You cannot delete an organization role if it is used as the organization **Default** role. But, you _can_ reassign the **Default** role to any other role.

To reassign the **Default** role:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=organizations-settings/roles).
1. In the navigation sidebar, select **Organization Settings**.
1. Select the **Roles** tab. [Create a new role](/docs/organizations/create-roles-permissions#create-a-new-role-for-your-organization) or select an existing role from the list.
1. At the top right of the screen, open the "..." menu.
1. From the dropdown, select the **Set as Default role** option.
