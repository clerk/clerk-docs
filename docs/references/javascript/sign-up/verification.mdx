# Verification

These are all methods on [the `SignUp` class](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) that allow you to verify a user's sign-up request.

## `prepareVerification()`

```typescript
function prepareVerification(params: PrepareVerificationParams): Promise<SignUp>;
```

The `prepareVerification` is used to initiate the verification process for a field that requires it. As mentioned above, there are two fields that need to be verified:

- **`emailAddress`**: The email address can be verified via an email code. This is a one-time code that is sent to the email already provided to the SignUp object. The `prepareVerification` sends this email.
- **`phoneNumber`**: The phone number can be verified via a phone code. This is a one-time code that is sent via an SMS to the phone already provided to the SignUp object. The `prepareVerification` sends this SMS.

### `PrepareVerificationParams`

  rows={[
 {cells: [
      <code>strategy</code>,
      <code>string</code>,
      <>
      The verification strategy to validate the user's sign-up request. The following strategies are supported:
      <ul>
        <li><code>phone_code</code>: Send an SMS with a unique token to input.</li>
        <li><code>email_code</code>: Send an email with a unique token to input.</li>
        <li><code>email_link</code>: Send an email with a link which validates sign-up</li>
        <li><code>saml</code>: Authenticate against SAML. Experimental</li>
        <li><code>oauth_*</code>: Authenticate against <a href="/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/authenticate-with#o-auth-strategy">various OAuth providers</a>.</li>
        <li><code>web3_*_signature</code>: Authenticate against Web3 signatures.</li>
      </ul>
      </>
 ]},
 {cells: [
    <code>redirectUrl</code>,
    <code>string</code>,
    <>
    The URL to redirect the user to after the verification process is complete. <strong>Only supported on <code>email_link</code>, <code>oauth_*</code>, and <code>saml</code> strategies</strong>.
    </>
 ]}
  ]}
/>

## `attemptVerification()`

```typescript
function attemptVerification(params: AttemptVerificationParams): Promise<SignUp>;
```

Attempts to complete the in-flight verification process that corresponds to the given strategy. In order to use this method, you should first initiate a verification process by calling [SignUp.prepareVerification](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/verification#prepare-verification).

Depending on the strategy, the method parameters could differ.
