title: useWaitlist()
description: Access and manage the waitlist state in your React application with Clerk's useWaitlist() hook.
sdk: chrome-extension, expo, nextjs, react, react-router, remix, tanstack-react-start
---

The `useWaitlist()` hook provides access to the [`WaitlistFuture`](/docs/reference/javascript/waitlist-future) object, which allows you to build custom waitlist UIs with reactive state management. This hook is ideal for creating custom waitlist experiences when your app is in [**Waitlist** mode](/docs/guides/secure/restricting-access#waitlist).

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `waitlist`
  - [`WaitlistFuture`](/docs/reference/javascript/waitlist-future)

  The current active `WaitlistFuture` instance, for use in custom flows.

  ---

  - `errors`
  - `Errors`

  The errors that occurred during the last API request.

  ---

  - `fetchStatus`
  - `'idle' | 'fetching'`

  The fetch status of the underlying `WaitlistFuture` resource.
</Properties>

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use the `useWaitlist()` hook to create a custom waitlist form. Users can submit their email address to join the waitlist, and the component displays appropriate feedback based on the submission state.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/waitlist/page.tsx' }}
'use client'

import { useWaitlist } from '@clerk/react'

export default function WaitlistPage() {
  const { waitlist, errors, fetchStatus } = useWaitlist()

  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    const formData = new FormData(e.currentTarget)
    const emailAddress = formData.get('emailAddress') as string

    await waitlist.join({ emailAddress })
  }

  if (waitlist.id) {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Successfully joined the waitlist!</h1>
        <p>We'll notify you when you're approved.</p>
      </div>
    )
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Join the Waitlist</h1>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <label htmlFor="email">Email address</label>
        <input
          id="email"
          name="emailAddress"
          type="email"
          required
        />
        {errors.fields.emailAddress && (
          <p>{errors.fields.emailAddress.longMessage}</p>
        )}
        <button type="submit" disabled={fetchStatus === 'fetching'}>
          {fetchStatus === 'fetching' ? 'Submitting...' : 'Join Waitlist'}
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  )
}
```
