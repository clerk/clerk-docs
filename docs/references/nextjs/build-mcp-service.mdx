If you're building an application and want to allow large language model (LLM) apps to securely access user data within your app, you'll need to set up a **Model Context Protocol** (MCP) service. MCP enables external tools like LLM-based apps to request user permission to access specific data from your service. Refer to the [dedicated MCP section](/docs/oauth/how-clerk-implements-oauth#building-a-model-context-protocol-service) for more information.

There are two parties involved in MCP - "client" and "server". In web development, the terms "client" and "server" often refer to the frontend (browser) and backend (web server). However, in this context, these terms have different meanings:

- The "client" is the LLM application that wants to access another service on a user's behalf. For example, Claude would be the "client" if it wants to get access to Gmail.
- The "server" is the system that hosts the protected resources the client wants to access. In this example, this would be Gmail. This is sometimes referred to as the "resource server" or "MCP server".

This guide demonstrates how to build an MCP server using Clerk's OAuth server in your Next.js app. This example is written for Next.js App Router, but **can be adapted for Next.js Pages Router**. It assumes that you have already integrated Clerk into your app by following the [quickstart](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs).

<Steps>
  ## Install dependencies

  To get started, this implementation requires the following packages to be installed in your project in addition to `@clerk/nextjs`:

  - [`@vercel/mcp-adapter`](https://github.com/vercel/mcp-adapter): A utility library that simplifies building an MCP server by handling the core protocol logic for you. It also includes an authentication wrapper that allows you to plug in your own token validation - in this case, using Clerk's OAuth tokens.
  - [`@clerk/mcp-tools`](https://github.com/clerk/mcp-tools): A helper library built on top of the [MCP TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) used to connect Clerk OAuth with MCP easily.
  - [`@clerk/backend`](/docs/references/backend/overview): Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK provides a `MachineAuthObject` type that can be used to authenticate machine requests.

    ```

  ## Set up your Next.js app with Clerk and MCP imports

  The following example shows the required imports and setup needed to implement an MCP server with Clerk in your Next.js app.

  1. In your `app/` directory, create a `[transport]` folder. This dynamic segment allows the MCP server to support different transport protocols used by the LLM tool, like `streamable-http`, based on the value of **transport**.

  1. Inside this directory, create a `route.ts` file with the following code.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'app/[transport]/route.ts' }}
  import { createMcpHandler, experimental_withMcpAuth as withMcpAuth } from '@vercel/mcp-adapter'
  import { auth, clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
  import { type MachineAuthObject } from '@clerk/backend'

  const clerk = await clerkClient()
  ```

  ## Create your MCP server and define tools

  To let external LLM-powered tools securely interact with your app, you need to define an MCP server, and expose one or more [resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources), [prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/prompts), and/or [tools](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools). The following example registers a single tool called `get_clerk_user_data` that retrieves information about the authenticated Clerk user.

  The `createMcpHandler()` function is used to create a new MCP server. Inside it, you can define tools that external LLM-based apps can invoke using `server.tool()`. Each tool includes:

  - A name (`get-clerk-user-data`).
  - A description of what the tool does.
  - Input parameters (none in this case).
  - A function that represents the implementation of the tool, in this case, it extracts the user's auth info from the OAuth token, fetches the user's data using `clerk.users.getUser()` and returns it in MCP's expected response format.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'app/[transport]/route.ts', mark: [[7, 27]] }}
  import { createMcpHandler, experimental_withMcpAuth as withMcpAuth } from '@vercel/mcp-adapter'
  import { auth, clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
  import { type MachineAuthObject } from '@clerk/backend'

  const clerk = await clerkClient()

  const handler = createMcpHandler((server) => {
    server.tool(
      'get-clerk-user-data',
      'Gets data about the Clerk user that authorized this request',
      {},
      async (_, { authInfo }) => {
        const clerkAuthInfo = authInfo as unknown as MachineAuthObject<'oauth_token'>
        if (!clerkAuthInfo?.subject) {
          console.error(authInfo)
          return {
            content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Error: user not authenticated' }],
          }
        }
        const user = await clerk.users.getUser(clerkAuthInfo.subject)
        return {
          content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(user) }],
        }
      },
    )
  })
  ```

  ## Secure your MCP server

  Now that your MCP server and tools are defined, the next step is to secure your endpoints with OAuth. This ensures only authenticated clients with valid Clerk-issued tokens can access your tools.

  1. The `withMcpAuth()` function is used to wrap the MCP handler in authentication logic. It uses Clerk's [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) helper to verify the incoming OAuth token. [Learn more about verifying OAuth tokens in Next.js apps](/docs/references/nextjs/verifying-oauth-access-tokens).

  {/* TODO: Add note about Authorization header and www-authenticate*/}

  1. The `authHandler` is exported for both `GET` and `POST` methods, making your MCP server accessible to external tools using either HTTP method.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'app/[transport]/route.ts' }}
  const authHandler = withMcpAuth(
    handler,
    async (_, token) => {
      if (!token) return null
      return await auth({ acceptsToken: 'oauth_token' })
    },
    { required: true },
  )

  export { authHandler as GET, authHandler as POST }
  ```

  ## Expose MCP metadata endpoints

  To comply with the MCP specification, your server must expose:

  - [OAuth protected resource metadata](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728#section-4.1) at a specific endpoint (`.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`)
  - [OAuth authorization server metadata](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8414) at a specific endpoint (`.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`).

  These metadata endpoints allow clients to discover where to authenticate and some details about how the authentication service works. Clerk provides prebuilt helpers that handle this for you:

  - `authServerMetadataHandlerClerk`: Next.js route handler that serves OAuth authorization server metadata in the format expected by MCP clients.
  - `protectedResourceHandlerClerk`: Next.js route handler that serves OAuth protected resource metadata in the format expected by MCP clients. **This handler automatically uses your `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` environment variable.**

  > [!NOTE]
  > For a more in-depth explanation of these helpers, see the [MCP Next.js reference](https://github.com/clerk/mcp-tools/tree/main/next).

  To expose your MCP metadata endpoints:

  1. In your `app/` directory, create a `.well-known` folder.
  1. Inside this directory, create two subfolders:
     - `oauth-authorization-server`
     - `oauth-protected-resource`
  1. In each folder, create a `route.ts` file with the following code for that specific route.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'app/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/route.ts' }}
  import { authServerMetadataHandlerClerk } from '@clerk/mcp-tools/next'

  const handler = authServerMetadataHandlerClerk()

  export { handler as GET }
  ```

  ```ts {{ filename: 'app/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/route.ts' }}
  import { protectedResourceHandlerClerk } from '@clerk/mcp-tools/next'

  const handler = protectedResourceHandlerClerk()

  export { handler as GET }
  ```

  ## Connect your client LLM to the MCP server

  <Include src="_partials/connecting-client-mcp-server" />

  ## Finished ðŸŽ‰

  You've now successfully connected your client to the MCP server and authenticated it using Clerk. Your LLM agent can securely access user data through the exposed tools in your server.
