description: Learn how to integrate Clerk into your TanStack Start application using the Clerk TanStack Start SDK.
---

The Clerk TanStack Start SDK is built on top of the [React SDK](/docs/references/react/overview) and is the recommended method for integrating Clerk into your TanStack Start application.

## Guides

- [Read session and user data](/docs/references/tanstack-start/read-session-data)
- [Add custom sign-in-or-up page](/docs/references/tanstack-start/custom-sign-in-or-up-page)

## Client-side helpers

The TanStack Start SDK is a wrapper around Clerk React, so you can use the hooks that Clerk React provides. These hooks give you access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) object, and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up. Learn more in the [React SDK reference](/docs/references/react/overview).

## Server-side helpers

The following references show how to integrate Clerk features into applications using TanStack Start server functions and API routes.

- [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/tanstack-start/get-auth)

### `Auth` object

The `getAuth()` returns an `Auth` object. This JavaScript object contains important information like session data, your user's ID, as well as their organization ID. Learn more about the `Auth` object [here](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object).
