# Session Methods

These are all methods on [the Clerk class](/reference-js/clerk/clerk) that help you manage the active session and/or organization.

## `setSession()`

```typescript
function setSession(
    session: Session | string | null,
    beforeEmit?: BeforeEmitCallback
): Promise<void>;
```

Set the current session on this client to the provided session. The provided session can be either a complete Session object or simply its unique identifier.

Passing null as the session will result in the current session to be removed from the client.

If an active session already exists, it will be replaced with the new one. The change happens in three steps:

1. The current `Session` object is set to **undefined**, which causes the control components to stop rendering their children as though Clerk is still initializing.
2. The **beforeEmit** callback is executed. If a `Promise` is returned, Clerk waits for the `Promise` to resolve.
3. The current `Session` is set to the passed **session**. This causes the control components to render their children again.

**Parameters**

| Name        | Type                                                       | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| session     | Session \| string \| null                          | A `Session` object or `Session ID` string to be set as the current session, or **null** to simply remove the active session, without setting a new one. |
| beforeEmit? | (session: Session \| null) => Promise{"<any>"} \| void | Callback that will trigger when the current session is set to **undefined**, before finally being set to the passed session. Usually used for navigation. |

**Returns**

| Type          | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| {"Promise<void>"} | This method returns a `Promise` which doesn't resolve to any value. The `Promise` will resolve after the passed `session` is set. |


## `setActive()`

```typescript
function setActive({
    session,
    organization,
    beforeEmit,
}: SetActiveParams): Promise<void>;
```

`setActive` can be used to set the active session and/or organization.
It will eventually replace `setSession`.
