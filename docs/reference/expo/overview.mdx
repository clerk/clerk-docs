The Clerk Expo SDK gives you access to prebuilt components, React hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier. Refer to the [quickstart guide](/docs/expo/getting-started/quickstart) to get started.

## Available resources

The Expo SDK gives you access to the following resources:

### Hooks

The Expo SDK provides the following hooks:

- [`useSignInWithApple()`](/docs/reference/expo/use-sign-in-with-apple)
- [`useSSO()`](/docs/reference/expo/use-sso)
- [`useLocalCredentials()`](/docs/reference/expo/use-local-credentials)

Because the Expo SDK is built on top of the Clerk React SDK, you can use the hooks that the React SDK provides. These hooks include access to the [`Clerk`](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk) object, [`User` object](/docs/reference/javascript/user), [`Organization` object](/docs/reference/javascript/organization), and a set of useful helper methods for signing in and signing up.

### Components

- **Native** apps:
  - [`<ClerkLoaded>`](/docs/reference/components/control/clerk-loaded)
  - [`<ClerkLoading>`](/docs/reference/components/control/clerk-loading)
  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-in)
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-out)
  - [`<Protect>`](/docs/reference/components/control/protect)
  - For other components, see the [custom flows](#custom-flows) section for more information.
- **Web** apps:
  - All Clerk components are available. See [the component docs](/docs/reference/components/overview) for more information.

## Custom flows

<If sdk="expo">
  > [!WARNING]
  > Expo does not support email links. You can request this feature on [Clerk's roadmap](https://feedback.clerk.com/).
</If>

For **native** applications, Clerk's prebuilt components are not supported. You must use the Clerk API to build custom UI's for flows such as signing in and signing up. See the [custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview) guides for more information.

For **web** applications, if Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/reference/components/overview) don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. See the [custom flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview) guides for more information.

## Deploy your app

To learn how to deploy your Expo application, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/development/deployment/expo).
