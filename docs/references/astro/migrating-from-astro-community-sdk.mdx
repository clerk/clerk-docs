# Migrating from the Astro community SDK

In July 2024, we introduced official support for Astro. This migration guide covers converting from the [`astro-clerk-auth`](https://github.com/panteliselef/astro-with-clerk-auth) community SDK to the official SDK. It covers the breaking changes that were introduced and provides examples on how to resolve them.


**Overview:**
- Install `@clerk/astro`, uninstall `astro-clerk-auth`
- Update import paths
- Replace deprecated APIs

## Installation

Uninstall the community SDK and install the new offical SDK for Astro.

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash filename="terminal"
    npm uninstall astro-clerk-auth
    npm install @clerk/astro
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    yarn remove astro-clerk-auth
    yarn add @clerk/astro
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    pnpm remove astro-clerk-auth
    pnpm add @clerk/astro
    ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Breaking Changes

### The integration

When using the integration from `@clerk/astro` we are now hotloading clerk-js by default.
Previously you could choose between two strategies when using the clerk intergration. Now only one is offered:

**Hotload** 

```diff
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import node from "@astrojs/node";
- import clerk from "astro-clerk-auth/hotload";
- import clerk from "astro-clerk-auth";
- import clerk from "astro-clerk-auth/integration";
- import clerk from "astro-clerk-auth/integration/hotload";
+ import clerk from "@clerk/astro";
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [clerk()],
  adapter: node({ mode: "standalone" }),
  output: "server",
});

**Bundled** \
We have completely removed the option for an integration that uses the bundled clerk-js variant

### Prefix for environment variable

We changed the expected required prefix for environment variables available in client-side code. This was to align with [best practises](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/) by Astro.
This change is applicable to all [environment variables](https://clerk.com/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables) Clerk supports.

```diff

- PUBLIC_ASTRO_APP_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
+ PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=

- PUBLIC_ASTRO_APP_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=
+ PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=

- PUBLIC_ASTRO_APP_*=
+ PUBLIC_*=

```


### Changes to Astro components

```diff

- import { UserProfile } from "@clerk/astro/components/interactive"
+ import { UserProfile } from "@clerk/astro/components"

- import { Protect } from "@clerk/astro/components/control"
+ import { Protect } from "@clerk/astro/components"

- import { SignInButton } from "@clerk/astro/components/unstyled"
+ import { SignInButton } from "@clerk/astro/components"

```

### Changes related to stores

Submodule `/stores` was replaced with `/client`. For the full list of the stores see [here](docs/references/astro/overview#client-side-helpers)

```diff
- import { $clerk } from "astro-clerk-auth/stores"
+ import { $clerkStore } from "@clerk/astro/client"


- import { $csrState } from "astro-clerk-auth/stores"
- import { $initialState } from "astro-clerk-auth/stores"
+ import { $userStore } from "@clerk/astro/client"
+ import { $sessionStore } from "@clerk/astro/client"
```

### Submodule removal

Submodule `/v0` was dropped completely and the previously exported constants are no longer available.

```diff
- import { apiKey, secretKey, DOMAIN, ... } from "astro-clerk-auth/v0"
```

### `clerkClient` changes

`clerkClient` as a variable was already deprecated. Now it should be used as a function and it accepts the Astro context.

```diff
import type { APIRoute } from "astro";
- import { clerkClient } from "astro-clerk-auth/v0"
+ import { clerkClient } from "@clerk/astro/server"

export const GET: APIRoute = async (context) => {
-   clerkClient.users.getUser(...)
+   clerkClient(context).users.getUser(...)
  ...
};
```

### React components changes

Previously there was two ways of using a React component inside a `.astro` file. We have decided to drop the submodule `/components/react` in order to avoid confusion.

```diff
---
- import { SignedIn } from "@clerk/astro/components/react";
+ import { SignedIn } from "@clerk/astro/react";
---

- <SignedIn>
+ <SignedIn client:load>
    {...}
</SignedIn>
```

In order to use a React component inside a `.jsx` or `.tsx` file, you simply need to update the import path.

```diff
import {
  SignInButton,
  SignedIn,
  SignedOut,
  UserButton
- } from '@clerk/astro/client/react'
+ } from '@clerk/astro/react'

export default function Header() {
  return (
    <>
      <p>My App</p>
      <SignedOut>
        <SignInButton />
      </SignedOut>
      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton />
      </SignedIn>
    </>
  )
}
```
