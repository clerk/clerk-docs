  - Use Microsoft Azure Entra ID to authenticate users with OAuth.
  - Protect your app from [the nOAuth exploit](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth).
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with Microsoft Azure Entra ID (formerly [Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/new-name)) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Microsoft account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Microsoft**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials, which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your Microsoft Entra ID account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

<Steps>
  ### Create a Microsoft Entra ID app

  > [!TIP]
  > If you already have a Microsoft Entra ID app you'd like to connect to Clerk, select your app from the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and skip to [the next step in this tutorial](#get-your-client-id-and-client-secret).

  1. On the homepage of the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home), in the **Azure services** section, select **[Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview)**.
  1. In the sidebar, open the **Manage** dropdown and select **[App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/RegisteredApps)**.
  1. Select **New Registration**. You'll be redirected to the **Register an application** page.
  1. Complete the form as follows:
     1. Under **Name**, enter your app name.
     1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant – Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)**.
     1. Under **Redirect URI (Optional)**, select **Web**.
     1. Select **Register** to submit the form.

  ### Get your client ID and client secret

  Once your Microsoft Entra ID app is created, or once you select your app from the Microsoft Azure portal, you'll be redirected to its **Overview**.

  1. From your app's overview, save the **Application (client) ID** somewhere secure. You'll need it to connect your Microsoft Entra ID app to your Clerk app.
  1. Under **Client credentials**, select **Add a certificate or secret** to generate a Client Secret. You'll be redirected to the **Certificate & secrets** page.
  1. Select **New client secret**. In the modal that opens, enter a description and set an expiration time for your secret.
     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > When your secret expires, your social connection will stop working until you generate a new client secret and add it to your Clerk app.
  1. Save the new client secret's **Value** somewhere secure. You'll add this and your client ID to your Clerk app later. Keep this page open.

  ### Connect your Entra ID app and get your redirect URI

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Microsoft**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on. Then:
     - Under **Client ID**, paste the value you copied from **Application (client) ID** in the Microsoft Azure portal.
     - Under **Client Secret**, paste the client secret value you generated.
     - Save the **Authorized redirect URI** somewhere secure.
     - Select **Add connection**.

  ### Enable OpenID

  To connect your Clerk app to your Microsoft app, set the **Authorized redirect URI** in your Microsoft Azure portal.

  1. Navigate back to the Microsoft Azure portal.
  1. In the sidebar, open the **Manage** dropdown and select **Authentication**.
  1. Select **Add a platform**.
  1. Select **Web**.
  1. In the **Redirect URIs** field and the **Front-channel logout URL** field, paste the **Authorized redirect URI** you copied from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Under **Implicit grant and hybrid flows**, check both **Access tokens** and **ID tokens**.
  1. Select **Configure** to save the changes.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal) page.
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:

  - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
  - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`

  1. Sign in with your Microsoft account.

  ### Secure your app against the nOAuth vulnerability

  [nOAuth](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth) is an exploit in Microsoft Entra ID OAuth apps that can lead to account takeovers via email address spoofing. Clerk mitigates this risk by enforcing stricter checks on verified email addresses.

  For further security, Microsoft offers an optional `xms_edov` claim, which provides additional context to determine whether the returned email is verified.

  To enable this optional claim, you must:

  1. In the Microsoft Azure portal, navigate to your app.
  1. In the sidebar, select **Token configuration**.
  1. Select **Add optional claim**.
  1. For the **Token type**, select **ID**. Then, in the table that opens, enable the `email` and `xms_pdl` claims.
  1. At the bottom of the modal, select **Add**. A new modal will prompt you to turn on the Microsoft Graph email permission. Enable it, then select **Add** to complete the form.
     > [!NOTE]
     > At the time of writing, the `xms_edov` claim is still in preview and may not be available for all apps. We'll choose another claim and rename it in the manifest later.
  1. Repeat the previous steps for **Token type**, but select **Access** instead of **ID**. The **Optional claims** list should now show two claims for `email` and two for `xms_pdl`: one each for **ID** and **Access**.
  1. In the sidebar, go to **Manifest**.
  1. In the text editor, search for `"acceptMappedClaims"` and set its value from `null` to `true`.
  1. Search for `"optionalClaims"`, where you'll find the `idToken` and `accessToken` arrays. Each array has an object with the name `xms_pdl`. Change the name to `xms_edov`.
  1. At the top of the page, select **Save**.
  1. In the sidebar, navigate back to **Token configuration** and confirm that the **Optional claims** list includes two claims for `email` and two for `xms_edov`: one each for **ID** and **Access**.

  With these steps complete, Microsoft will send the `xms_edov` claim in the token, which Clerk will use to determine whether the email is verified, even when used with Microsoft Entra ID.
</Steps>

## Limitations

- Currently, Clerk supports only the `common` tenant type, which allows sign-ins both from organization members and public Microsoft users.
  - The option to selecting the desired tenant type (`common`, `organizations`, `consumers` or specific tenant ID) will be available in an upcoming version of Clerk.
- Only credentials of type `secret` are supported (not the `certificate` type).

> [!TIP]
> If you're using [SAML with Microsoft](/docs/authentication/saml/azure), the different tenant types _are_ supported, and you can disregard these limitations.
