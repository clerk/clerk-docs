# `SessionWithActivities`

The `SessionWithActivities` object is a modified [Session](/docs/references/javascript/session) object. It contains most of the information that the `Session` object stores, adding extra information about the current session's latest activity.

The additional data included in the latest activity are useful for analytics purposes. A [SessionActivity](#session-activity) object will provide information about the user's location, device and browser.

While the `SessionWithActivities` object wraps the most important information around a `Session` object, the two objects have entirely different methods.
