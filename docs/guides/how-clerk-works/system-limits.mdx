description: Learn about rate limiting on the Clerk APIs.

Clerk rate limits certain endpoints to help protect users against brute-force attacks or to stop abuse of Clerk's platform.

## Errors

If you receive a `429` error code, you have been rate limited. All subsequent requests to that specific endpoint will be blocked for a given amount of time.

Requests that have been rate limited will receive the `Retry-After` response header, which contains the number of seconds after which the block expires.

## Frontend API requests

Frontend API requests are rate-limited per user and identified by their IP address.
