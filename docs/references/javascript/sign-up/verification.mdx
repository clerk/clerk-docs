# Verification

These are all methods on the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) class that allow you to verify a user's sign-up request.

## `prepareVerification()`

The `prepareVerification` is used to initiate the verification process for a field that requires it. As mentioned above, there are two fields that need to be verified:

- `emailAddress`: The email address can be verified via an email code. This is a one-time code that is sent to the email already provided to the SignUp object. The `prepareVerification` sends this email.
- `phoneNumber`: The phone number can be verified via a phone code. This is a one-time code that is sent via an SMS to the phone already provided to the SignUp object. The `prepareVerification` sends this SMS.

```typescript
function prepareVerification(params: PrepareVerificationParams): Promise<SignUpResource>;
```

### `PrepareVerificationParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
