title: Implement basic Role Based Access Control (RBAC) with metadata
description: Learn how to leverage Clerk's publicMetadata to implement your own basic Role Based Access Controls.
---

To control which users can access certain parts of your application, you can leverage Clerk's [roles](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#roles) feature. Although Clerk offers a roles feature as part of the feature set for [organizations](/docs/organizations/overview), not every app implements organizations. **This guide covers a workaround to set up a basic Role Based Access Control (RBAC) system for products that don't use Clerk's organizations or roles.**

This guide assumes that you're using Next.js App Router, but the concepts can be adapted to any React-based framework.

<Steps>
  ### Configure the session token

  Clerk provides [user metadata](/docs/users/metadata#user-metadata), which can be used to store information, and in this case, it can be used to store a user's role.

  There are three types of metadata:

  - `unsafeMetadata` - can be both read and modified in the browser, meaning users can modify this data. Therefore, you should validate `unsafeMetadata` before trusting it for sensitive operations.
  - `privateMetadata` - cannot be accessed nor modified in the browser.
  - `publicMetadata` - can be accessed in the browser, but only be modified server-side or in the Clerk Dashboard.

  Since `publicMetadata` can only be read but not modified in the browser, it is the safest and most appropriate choice for storing information

  To build a basic RBAC system, you first need to make `publicMetadata` available to the application directly from the session token. By attaching `publicMetadata` to the user's session, you can access the data without needing to make a fetch or network request each time.

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=sessions).
  1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **Sessions**.
  1. Under the **Customize session token** section, select **Edit**.
  1. In the modal that opens, enter the following JSON and select **Save**. If you have already customized your session token, you may need to merge this with what you currently have.

  ```json
  {
    "metadata": "{{user.public_metadata}}"
  }
  ```

  > [!CAUTION]
  > The session token has a 4KB size limit. Exceeding this limit can have adverse effects, such as an infinite redirect loop for users in Next.js applications.
  > To avoid this, it's recommended to move large claims out of the JWT and fetch them via a separate API call from your backend.

  ### Create a global TypeScript definition

  1. In your application's root folder, create a `types` directory.
  1. Inside this directory, add a `globals.d.ts` file. This file will provide auto-completion and prevent TypeScript errors when working with roles.

  For this guide, only the `admin` and `moderator` roles will be defined.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'types/globals.d.ts' }}
  export {}

  // Create a type for the roles
  export type Roles = 'admin' | 'moderator'

  declare global {
    interface CustomJwtSessionClaims {
      metadata: {
        role?: Roles
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Set the admin role for your user

  Later in the guide, you will add a basic admin tool to change a user's role. For now, manually add the `admin` role to your own user account.

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=users) .
  1. In the top navigation, select **Users**.
  1. Select your own user account.
  1. Scroll down to the **User metadata** section and next to the **Public** option, select **Edit**.
  1. Add the following JSON and select **Save**.

  ```json
  {
    "role": "admin"
  }
  ```

  ### Create a reusable function to check roles

  Create a helper function to simplify checking roles.

  1. In your application's root directory, create a `utils/` folder.
  1. Inside this directory, add a `roles.ts` file.
  1. Create a `checkRole()` helper that uses the [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) helper to access the user's session claims. From the session claims, access the `publicMetadata` object to check the user's role. The `checkRole()` helper should accept a role of type `Roles`, which you created in the [Create a global TypeScript definition](#create-a-global-typescript-definition) step. It should return `true` if the user has that role or `false` if they do not.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'utils/roles.ts' }}
  import { Roles } from '@/types/global'
  import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  export const checkRole = (role: Roles) => {
    const { sessionClaims } = auth()
    return sessionClaims?.metadata.role === role
  }
  ```

  > [!NOTE]
  > You can customize the behavior of the `checkRole()` helper function to suit your needs. For example, you could modify it to return the roles a user has or create a `protectByRole()` function that handles role-based redirects.

  ### Create the admin dashboard

  Now, it's time to create an admin dashboard. The first step is to create the `/admin` route.

  1. In your `app/` directory, create an `admin/` folder.
  1. In the `admin/` folder, create a file named `page.tsx`.
  1. Add the following placeholder code to the file.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/admin/page.tsx' }}
  export default function AdminDashboard() {
    return <p>This is the protected admin dashboard restricted to users with the `admin` role.</p>
  }
  ```

  ### Protect the admin dashboard

  To protect the `/admin` route, choose **one** of the two following methods:

  1. **Middleware**: Apply role-based access control globally at the route level. This method restricts access to all routes matching `/admin` before the request reaches the actual page.
  1. **Page-Level Role Check**: Apply role-based access control directly in the admin page component. This method protects the page itself but doesn't block access at the middleware level.

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > You only need to follow **one** of the following methods to secure your `/admin` route.

  #### Option 1: Protect the `/admin` route using middleware

  1. In your app's root directory, create a `middleware.ts` file.
  1. Use the `createRouteMatcher()` function to identify routes starting with `/admin`.
  1. Apply `clerkMiddleware` to intercept requests to the `/admin` route, and check the user's role in their `publicMetadata` to verify that they have the `admin` role. If they don't, redirect them to the home page.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts' }}
  import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
  import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

  const isAdminRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/admin(.*)'])

  export default clerkMiddleware((auth, req) => {
    // Protect all routes starting with `/admin`
    if (isAdminRoute(req) && auth().sessionClaims?.metadata?.role !== 'admin') {
      const url = new URL('/', req.url)
      return NextResponse.redirect(url)
    }
  })

  export const config = {
    matcher: [
      // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
      '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
      // Always run for API routes
      '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
    ],
  }
  ```

  #### Option 2: Protect the `/admin` route at the page-level

  1. Navigate to your `app/admin/page.tsx` file.
  1. Use the `checkRole()` function to check if the user has the `admin` role. If they don't, redirect them to the home page.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/admin/page.tsx' }}
  import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
  import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

  export default function AdminDashboard() {
    // Protect the page from users who are not admins
    if (!checkRole('admin')) {
      redirect('/')
    }

    return <p>This is the protected admin dashboard restricted to users with the `admin` role.</p>
  }
  ```

  ### Add admin tools to find users and manage roles

  You can use the `checkRole()` function along with server actions to build basic tools for finding users and managing roles.

  Create a server action for managing a user's role.

  1. In your `app/admin/` directory, create an `_actions.ts` file.
  1. Create a server action that uses the `checkRole()` function to verify that the current user has the `admin` role. If they do, proceed to update the specified user's role using Clerk's [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/user/update-user). This ensures that only administrators can modify user roles.

  ```ts {{ filename: 'app/admin/_actions.ts' }}
  'use server'

  import { checkRole } from '@/utils/roles'
  import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  export async function setRole(formData: FormData) {
    // Check that the user trying to set the role is an admin
    if (!checkRole('admin')) {
      return { message: 'Not Authorized' }
    }

    try {
      const res = await clerkClient().users.updateUser(formData.get('id') as string, {
        publicMetadata: { role: formData.get('role') },
      })
      return { message: res.publicMetadata }
    } catch (err) {
      return { message: err }
    }
  }
  ```

  With the server action set up, now build the `<SearchUsers />` component. This component includes a form for searching users, and when submitted, appends the search term to the URL as a search parameter. Your `/admin` route will then perform a query based on the updated URL.

  1. In your `app/admin/` directory, create a `_search-users.tsx` file.
  1. Add the following code to the file.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/admin/_search-users.tsx' }}
  'use client'

  import { usePathname, useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

  export const SearchUsers = () => {
    const router = useRouter()
    const pathname = usePathname()

    return (
      <div>
        <form
          onSubmit={(e) => {
            e.preventDefault()
            const form = e.currentTarget
            const formData = new FormData(form)
            const queryTerm = formData.get('search') as string
            router.push(pathname + '?search=' + queryTerm)
          }}
        >
          <label htmlFor="search">Search for Users</label>
          <input id="search" name="search" type="text" />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    )
  }
  ```

  With the server action and the search form set up, it's time to refactor the `app/admin/page.tsx` to be a server component. It will check whether a search parameter has been appended to the URL by the search form. If a search parameter is present, it will query for users matching the entered term.

  If one or more users are found, the component will display a list of users, showing their first and last names, primary email address, and current role. Each user will have `Make Admin` and `Make Moderator` buttons, which include hidden inputs for the user ID and role. These buttons will use the `setRole()` server action to update the user's role.

  1. Navigate to your `app/admin/page.tsx` file.
  1. Replace the code with the following code.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/admin/page.tsx' }}
  import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'
  import { checkRole } from '@/utils/roles'
  import { SearchUsers } from './_search-users'
  import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
  import { setRole } from './_actions'

  export default async function AdminDashboard(params: { searchParams: { search?: string } }) {
    if (!checkRole('admin')) {
      redirect('/')
    }

    const query = params.searchParams.search

    const users = query ? (await clerkClient().users.getUserList({ query })).data : []

    return (
      <>
        <p>This is the protected admin dashboard restricted to users with the `admin` role.</p>

        <SearchUsers />

        {users.map((user) => {
          return (
            <div key={user.id}>
              <div>
                {user.firstName} {user.lastName}
              </div>

              <div>
                {
                  user.emailAddresses.find((email) => email.id === user.primaryEmailAddressId)
                    ?.emailAddress
                }
              </div>

              <div>{user.publicMetadata.role as string}</div>

              <form action={setRole}>
                <input type="hidden" value={user.id} name="id" />
                <input type="hidden" value="admin" name="role" />
                <button type="submit">Make Admin</button>
              </form>

              <form action={setRole}>
                <input type="hidden" value={user.id} name="id" />
                <input type="hidden" value="moderator" name="role" />
                <button type="submit">Make Moderator</button>
              </form>
            </div>
          )
        })}
      </>
    )
  }
  ```

  ### Finished!

  The foundation of a custom RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system is now set up. Roles are attached directly to the user's session, allowing your application to access them without the need for additional network requests. The `checkRole()` helper function simplifies role checks and reduces code complexity. The final component is the admin dashboard, which enables admins to efficiently search for users and manage roles.
