# Clerk Docs Styleguides

These are the guidelines we use to write our docs. 

## Write with consistency

* “We” are the authors; “you” is the reader
* Use American English
* Hyphens? Spaces? Neither!
* When mentioning a documented component, function, etc, multiple times on a page, link to the reference documentation on the first mention of that item.


## Write to be understood

* Shorter is better
* Use task and outcome-based headings and titles that use verbs
* Lead with location; end with action
* Developers vs Users: Users are people logging in/out with Clerk. Developers are the audience we’re writing for.

## Write without excluding people

* Do not assume proficiency
* Be culturally neutral; avoid colloquialisms and pop culture references
* Avoid pronouns

## Write for translations

* Avoid gerunds (-ing words)

## Write for code

* Use monospace fonts for code, commands, file names, copy-ables; use bold for menus, URLs (clickable), and other UI copy
* Use carets to help users navigate menus; use “select” instead of “click”
* Write compliant JSON: no single quotes, no comments
* Use 2-space indents for code blocks

## Write for Clerk

* Authentications state (signed-in, signed-out, unknown) should be hyphenated and bolded to distinguish “recognized Clerk states” from general states of being (”She was signed out of the app” vs “When the user is signed-out…”).
