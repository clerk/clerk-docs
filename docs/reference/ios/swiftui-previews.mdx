description: Use `Clerk.preview()` and `ClerkEnvironment.json` to render iOS previews with realistic Clerk configuration.
sdk: ios

Use `Clerk.preview()` in `#Preview` blocks to render Clerk-powered SwiftUI screens without launching a full app session.

## Use `Clerk.preview()`

Inject `Clerk.preview()` into your preview environment:

```swift
import ClerkKit
import SwiftUI

#Preview("Signed Out") {
  ContentView()
    .environment(Clerk.preview { preview in
      preview.isSignedIn = false
    })
}

#Preview("Signed In") {
  ContentView()
    .environment(Clerk.preview())
}
```

### Parameters

<Properties>
  - `isSignedIn`
  - `Bool`

  Controls whether the preview uses signed-in or signed-out mock state. Defaults to `true`.
</Properties>

## Use `ClerkEnvironment.json` for realistic previews

For more realistic preview behavior, add your instance's `/v1/environment` response to a `ClerkEnvironment.json` file in your app bundle. `Clerk.preview()` will load it automatically.

<Steps>
  ### Copy your environment response

  Open the following URL in a new browser tab. Replace `YOUR_FRONTEND_API_URL` with your [Frontend API URL](!frontend-api-url).

  ```text
  https://{{fapi_url}}/v1/environment
  ```

  Then, copy the raw JSON response body.

  ### Create `ClerkEnvironment.json`

  In Xcode:

  1. Add a new file named `ClerkEnvironment.json` to your app project.
  1. Paste the `/v1/environment` JSON response into the file.
  1. Ensure your app target is selected in **Target Membership** so the file is included in the main bundle.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you change your Clerk configuration, fetch `/v1/environment` again and replace `ClerkEnvironment.json` so previews stay in sync.

  ### Refresh previews

  Rebuild the preview canvas. `Clerk.preview()` will:

  1. Look for `ClerkEnvironment.json` in `Bundle.main`.
  1. Use that environment if found and decodable.
  1. Fall back to `Clerk.Environment.mock` if the file is missing or invalid.
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

- If your preview still looks generic, confirm the file name is exactly `ClerkEnvironment.json` and that it is part of your app target.
- `Clerk.preview()` is preview-only. Outside SwiftUI previews, it returns `Clerk.shared`.
