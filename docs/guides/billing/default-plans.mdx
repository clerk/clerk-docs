description: What are default plans and how they are used in Clerk Billing
---

<Include src="_partials/billing/billing-experimental" />

The default plan is the plan your customers get assigned when they are created. If Billing is enabled for your instance, Clerk Billing automatically assigns the free plan to every new user or organization. This provides consistency throughout the product, ensuring every customer has an assigned subscription.

Your users can downgrade to the free plan at any time from a paid subscription.

If they have a paid subscription and stop paying, they will automatically be moved to the free plan.

When users cancel a paid subscription, they will also be moved to the free plan.

## Can I update it?

Yes, you can update a few details like the name, the slug, and public visibility.

Altering public visibility does not change the fact that customers get a free subscription, it just hides the free plan from the pricing table.

## Is it possible to change the default plan?

Not for now, but we do have plans to make it configurable. Once it's implemented, you could set a paid plan (usually with a free trial) as the default plan.
