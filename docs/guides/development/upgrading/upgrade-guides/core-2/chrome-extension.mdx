title: Upgrading `@clerk/chrome-extension` to Core 2
description: "Learn how to upgrade Clerk's Chrome Extension SDK to the latest version."
---

{/* WARNING: This is a generated file and should not be edited directly. To update its contents, see the "upgrade" package in the clerk/javascript repo. */}

Core 2 is included in the Chrome Extension SDK starting with version 1. This new version ships with an improved design and UX for its built-in components, no "flash of white page" when authenticating, and a variety of smaller DX improvements and housekeeping items. Each of the potentially breaking changes are detailed in this guide, below.

By the end of this guide, you’ll have successfully upgraded your project to use `@clerk/chrome-extension` v1. You’ll learn how to update your dependencies, resolve breaking changes, and find deprecations. Step-by-step instructions will lead you through the process.

## Preparing to upgrade

Before upgrading, it's highly recommended that you update your Clerk SDKs to the latest Core 1 version (`npm i @clerk/chrome-extension@0`). Some changes required for Core 2 SDKs can be applied incrementally to the v1 release, which should contribute to a smoother upgrading experience. After updating, look out for deprecation messages in your terminal and browser console. By resolving these deprecations you'll be able to skip many breaking changes from Core 2.

Additionally, some of the minimum version requirements for some base dependencies have been updated such that versions that are no longer supported or are at end-of-life are no longer guaranteed to work correctly with Clerk.

**Updating Node.js**

You need to have Node.js `18.17.0` or later installed. Last year, Node.js 16 entered EOL (End of life) status, so support for this version has been removed across Clerk SDKs. You can check your Node.js version by running `node -v` in your terminal. Learn more about how to [update and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs).

**Updating React**

All react-dependent Clerk SDKs now require you to use React 18 or higher. You can update your project by installing the latest version of `react` and `react-dom`.

```npm
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
```

If you are upgrading from React 17 or lower, make sure to [learn about how to upgrade your React version to 18](https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide) as well.

## Updating to Core 2

Whenever you feel ready, go ahead and install the latest version of any Clerk SDKs you are using. Make sure that you are prepared to patch some breaking changes before your app will work properly, however. The commands below demonstrate how to install the latest version.

```npm
npm install @clerk/chrome-extension
```

## CLI upgrade helper

Clerk now provides a `@clerk/upgrade` CLI tool that you can use to ease the upgrade process. The tool will scan your codebase and produce a list of changes you'll need to apply to your project. It should catch the vast majority of the changes needed for a successful upgrade to any SDK including Core 2. This can save you a lot of time reading through changes that don't apply to your project.

To run the CLI tool, navigate to your project and run it in the terminal:

```npm
npx @clerk/upgrade --from=core-1
```

If you are having trouble with `npx`, it's also possible to install directly with `npm i @clerk/upgrade -g`, and can then be run with the `clerk-upgrade` command.

## Breaking Changes

### `tokenCache` -> `storageCache` as `<ClerkProvider>` props

The `tokenCache` prop has been renamed to `storageCache` in order to accommodate the new [WebSSO feature](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/pull/2277). With the prop change from `tokenCache` to `storageCache`, the interface has been expanded to allow for more flexibility. The new interface is as follows:

```ts
type StorageCache = {
  createKey: (...keys: string[]) => string
  get: <T = any>(key: string) => Promise<T>
  remove: (key: string) => Promise<void>
  set: (key: string, value: string) => Promise<void>
}
```

And here's a full before/after example:

```jsx {{ prettier: false, del: [1], ins: [2] }}
<ClerkProvider tokenCache={/* ... */}>
<ClerkProvider storageCache={/* ... */}>
```

### Component design adjustments

The new version ships with improved design and UX across all of Clerk's [UI components](/docs/reference/components/overview). If you have used the [`appearance` prop](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/overview) or tokens for a [custom theme](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/appearance-prop/overview), you will likely need to make some adjustments to ensure your styling is still looking great. If you're using the [localization prop](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/localization) you will likely need to make adjustments to account for added or removed localization keys.

[More detail on these changes »](/docs/guides/development/upgrading/upgrade-guides/core-2#component-redesign)

### After sign up/in/out default value change

In Core 2, defining redirect URLs for after sign-up, sign-in, or sign-out via the Clerk Dashboard has been removed. Previously, the "Paths" section in the Clerk Dashboard included "Component paths" where URLs could be defined, accompanied by a deprecation warning. This functionality is now removed, and specifying redirect paths via the dashboard is no longer supported.

If you need to pass a redirect URL for after sign-up, sign-in, or sign-out, there are [several ways to achieve this](/docs/guides/development/customize-redirect-urls), including environment variables, middleware, or passing them directly to the relevant components.

As part of this change, the default URL for each of these props has been set to `/`, so if you are passing `/` explicitly to any one of the above props, that line is no longer necessary and can be removed.

```jsx {{ prettier: false, del: [1], ins: [2] }}
<UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/" />
<UserButton />
```

### Removed: `orgs` claim on JWT

In the previous version of Clerk's SDKs, if you decode the session token that Clerk returns from the server, you'll currently find an `orgs` claim on it. It lists all the orgs associated with the given user. Now, Clerk returns the `org_id`, `org_slug`, and `org_role` of the **active** organization.

The `orgs` claim was part of the `JwtPayload`. Here are a few examples of where the `JwtPayload` could be found.

<Accordion titles={["Next.js", "Fastify", "@clerk/backend", "@clerk/clerk-sdk-node"]} heading="h5">
  <AccordionPanel>
    ```typescript {{ filename: 'Next.js' }}
    import { getAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
    const claims: JwtPayload = getAuth(request).sessionClaims

    import { getAuth } from '@clerk/ssr.server'
    const claims: JwtPayload = (await getAuth(request)).sessionClaims
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    ```typescript {{ filename: 'Fastify' }}
    import { getAuth } from '@clerk/fastify'
    const claims: JwtPayload = (await getAuth(request)).sessionClaims
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    ```typescript {{ filename: '@clerk/backend' }}
    import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/backend'

    const clerkClient = createClerkClient({ secretKey: '' })
    const requestState = await clerkClient.authenticateRequest(request, { publishableKey: '' })
    const claims: JwtPayload = requestState.toAuth().sessionClaims
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    <Include src="_partials/upgrade-node-express.mdx" />

    ```typescript {{ filename: '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node' }}
    import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node'

    router.use((...args) => clerkClient.expressRequireAuth()(...args))
    router.get('/me', async (req, reply: Response) => {
      return reply.json({ auth: req.auth })
    })
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

If you would like to have your JWT return all of the user's organizations, you can create a [custom JWT template](/docs/guides/sessions/jwt-templates) in your dashboard. Add `{ "orgs": "user.organizations" }` to it.

### Path routing is now the default

On components like [`<SignIn />`](/docs/reference/components/authentication/sign-in) you can define the props `routing` and `path`. `routing` can be set to `'hash' | 'path'` and describes the routing strategy that should be used. `path` defines where the component is mounted when `routing="path"` is used. [Learn more about Clerk routing](/docs/guides/how-clerk-works/routing).

In Core 2, the **default** `routing` strategy has become `'path'`. Unless you change the `routing` prop, you'll need to define the `path` prop. The affected components are:

- `<SignIn />`
- `<SignUp />`
- `<UserProfile />`
- `<CreateOrganization />`
- `<OrganizationProfile />`

Here's how you'd use the components going forward:

```jsx {{ prettier: false }}
<SignIn path="/sign-in" />
<SignUp path="/sign-up" />
<UserProfile path="/user-profile" />
<CreateOrganization path="/create-org" />
<OrganizationProfile path="/org-profile" />
```

If you don't define the `path` prop an error will be thrown. Of course, you can still use `routing="hash"` or `routing="virtual"`.

```jsx {{ prettier: false }}
<UserProfile routing="hash" />
<OrganizationProfile routing="virtual" />
```

### Image URL Name Consolidation

There are a number of Clerk primitives that contain images, and previously they each had different property names, like `avatarUrl`, `logoUrl`, `profileImageUrl`, etc. In order to promote consistency and make it simpler for developers to know where to find associated images, all image properties are now named `imageUrl`. See the list below for all affected classes:

<Accordion
  titles={["<code>Organization.logoUrl</code> -&gt; <code>Organization.imageUrl</code>", "<code>User.profileImageUrl</code> -&gt; <code>.imageUrl</code>"]}
>
  <AccordionPanel>
    The `logoUrl` property of any [`Organization` object](/docs/reference/javascript/organization) has been changed to `imageUrl`.
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The `profileImageUrl` property of any `User` object has been changed to `imageUrl`.
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

### Deprecation removals & housekeeping

As part of this major version, a number of previously deprecated props, arguments, methods, etc. have been removed. Additionally there have been some changes to things that are only used internally, or only used very rarely. It's highly unlikely that any given app will encounter any of these items, but they are all breaking changes, so they have all been documented below.

> [!NOTE]
> For this section more than any other one, use the CLI upgrade tool (`npx @clerk/upgrade`). Changes in this
> section are very unlikely to appear in your codebase, the tool will save time looking for them.

#### Deprecation removals

<Accordion
  titles={["<code>User.update({ password: &#39;x&#39; })</code> -&gt; <code>User.updatePassword(&#39;x&#39;)</code>"]}
>
  <AccordionPanel>
    If you are updating a user's password via the [`User.update` method](/docs/reference/javascript/user#update), it must be changed to [`User.updatePassword`](/docs/reference/javascript/user#update-password) instead. This method will require the current password as well as the desired new password. We made this update to improve the security of password changes. Example below:

    ```js {{ del: [1], ins: [[3, 7]] }}
    user.update({ password: 'foo' })

    user.updatePassword({
      currentPassword: 'bar',
      newPassword: 'foo',
      signOutOfOtherSessions: true,
    })
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>
</Accordion>

#### Other Breaking changes

<Accordion
  titles={["<code>Organization.getRoles</code> arguments changed", "<code>Organization.getMemberships</code> arguments changed", "<code>Organization.getDomains</code> arguments changed", "<code>Organization.getInvitations</code> arguments changed", "<code>Organization.getMembershipRequests</code> arguments changed", "<code>User.getOrganizationInvitations</code> arguments changed", "<code>User.getOrganizationSuggestions</code> arguments changed", "<code>User.getOrganizationMemberships</code> arguments changed", "<code>Users.getOrganizationMembershipList</code> return signature changed", "<code>Users.getOrganizationInvitationList</code> return signature changed", "<code>Organizations.getOrganizationInvitationList</code> return type changed", "<code>User.getOrganizationMembershipList</code> return type changed", "<code>Users.getOrganizationList</code> return signature changed", "<code>Organization.getOrganizationList</code> return type changed", "<code>Invitations.getInvitationList</code> return signature changed", "<code>Sessions.getSessionList</code> return signature changed", "<code>Users.getUserList</code> return signature changed", "<code>AllowlistIdentifiers.getAllowlistIdentifierList</code> return signature changed", "<code>Clients.getClientList</code> return signature changed", "<code>RedirectUrls.getRedirectUrlList</code> return signature changed", "<code>Users.getUserOauthAccessToken</code> return signature changed", "<code>setSession</code> -&gt; <code>setActive</code>", "<code>Organization.create(&#39;x&#39;)</code> -&gt; <code>Organization.create({ name: &#39;x&#39; })</code>", "<code>Organization.getPendingInvitations()</code> -&gt; <code>Organization.getInvitations({ status: &#39;pending&#39; })</code>"]}

  <AccordionPanel>
    There have been a couple changes to the pagination arguments that can be passed into this function - `limit` has been renamed to `pageSize`, and `offset` has been renamed to `initialPage`. This will help to make it more clear and simple to reason about pagination control. Example of how changes might look below:

    ```js {{ del: [2, 4], ins: [3, 5] }}
    const { data } = await organization.getRoles({
      limit: 10,
      pageSize: 10,
      offset: 10,
      initialPage: 2,
    })

    The response payload of `Users.getOrganizationMembershipList` was changed as part of the core 2 release. Rather than directly returning ` data`, the return signature is now `{ data, totalCount }`. Since Backend API responses are paginated, the `totalCount` property is helpful in determining the total number of items in the response easily, and this change in the backend SDK aligns the response shape with what the Backend API returns directly.

    Here's an example of how the response shape would change with this modification:

    ```js {{ del: [1], ins: [2] }}
    const data = await clerkClient.users.getOrganizationMembershipList()
    const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.users.getOrganizationMembershipList()
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

    ```js {{ del: [1], ins: [2] }}
    const data = await clerkClient.users.getOrganizationInvitationList()
    const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.users.getOrganizationInvitationList()
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

  <AccordionPanel>
    The return type for this function was previously `[Items]` but has now been updated to `{ data: [Items], totalCount: number }`. Since the Clerk API responses are paginated, the `totalCount` property is helpful in determining the total number of items in the response easily. A before/after code example can be seen below:

    ```js {{ del: [5], ins: [6] }}
    const data = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationInvitationList({
      organizationId: '...',
    })

    data.forEach(() => {})

    `setSession` should be replaced with `setActive`. The format of the parameters has changed slightly - `setActive` takes an object where `setSession` took params directly. The `setActive` function also can accept an `organization` param that is used to set the currently [Active Organization](!active-organization). The return signature did not change. Read the [API documentation](/docs/reference/javascript/clerk#set-active) for more detail. This function should be expected to be returned from one of the following Clerk hooks: `useSessionList`, `useSignUp`, or `useSignIn`. Some migration examples:

    ```js {{ prettier: false, del: [1, 4, 7], ins: [2, 5, 8] }}
    await setSession('sessionID', () => void)
    await setActive({ session: 'sessionID', beforeEmit: () => void })

    await setSession(sessionObj)
    await setActive({ session: sessionObj })

    await setSession(sessionObj, () => void)
    await setActive({ session: sessionObj, beforeEmit: () => void })
    ```

    `setActive` also supports setting an [Active Organization](!active-organization):

    ```js {{ prettier: false }}
    await setActive({
      session: 'sessionID',
      organization: 'orgID',
      beforeEmit: () => void,
    })
    await setActive({
      session: sessionObj,
      organization: orgObj,
      beforeEmit: () => void,
    })
    ```

  <AccordionPanel>
    Passing a string as an argument to `Organization.create` is no longer possible - instead, pass an object with the `name` property.

    Organization.create('...')
    Organization.create({ name: '...' })
    ```
  </AccordionPanel>

    The `Organization.getPendingInvitations()` method has been removed. You can use `Organization.getInvitations` instead.

    ```js {{ del: [1], ins: [2] }}
    Organization.getPendingInvitations()
    Organization.getInvitations({ status: 'pending' })
    ```
