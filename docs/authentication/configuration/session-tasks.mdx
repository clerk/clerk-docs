title: Tasks after sign-up/sign-in
description: Learn how to configure your application to require users to complete specific tasks after signing up or signing in.
---

**Session tasks** are pending requirements that users must complete after authentication, such as choosing an organization. When enabled in the Clerk Dashboard, these tasks are handled automatically within the `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` components.

## Available tasks

Each task is identified by a unique [`SessionTask['key']`](/docs/references/javascript/types/session-task). You can use these task keys to conditionally handle different requirements in your application logic.

The following table lists the available tasks and their corresponding keys.

| Setting | Key | Description |
| - | - | - |
| [Allow personal accounts](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings) | `choose-organization` | Disabled by default when enabling organizations. When disabled, users are required to choose an organization after authenticating. When enabled, users can choose a personal account instead of an organization. |

## Session states

After authentication, users enter one of three states:

- **Signed-in**: Authentication complete. Can access protected content or routes.
- **Pending**: Authentication complete, but session tasks incomplete. Can't access protected content or routes.
- **Signed-out**: Authentication failed or not attempted. Can't access protected content or routes.

When authenticating, sessions remain `pending` until users complete the required tasks. By default, `pending` sessions are treated as signed-out across Clerk's authentication context.

## Implementation

### Displaying tasks

Once enabled in the Clerk Dashboard, tasks are **embedded by default** within the `<SignUp />` and `<SignIn />` components. For more customization, you can opt out of using the `<SignUp />` and `<SignIn />` components and [create custom pages for tasks](/docs/custom-flows/overview#session-tasks).

The following table lists the available tasks and their corresponding components. See the linked reference guide for usage instructions.

| Name | Component |
| - | - |
| [Personal accounts disabled (default)](/docs/organizations/overview#allow-personal-accounts) | [`<TaskChooseOrganization />`](/docs/components/authentication/task-choose-organization) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Personal accounts being disabled by default was released on 08-22-2025. Applications created before this date will not be able to see the **Allow personal accounts** setting, because personal accounts were enabled by default.

If the prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can also build your own UI using the `Session.currentTask` property to check if the user has pending session tasks. Refer to the [custom flows documentation](/docs/custom-flows/overview) for specific implementation guides.

<CodeBlockTabs options={["React", "JavaScript"]}>
  ```jsx
  import { useSession } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

  const { session } = useSession()

  if (session?.currentTask) {
    // Check for pending tasks and display custom UI to help users resolve them
    // See https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/overview#session-tasks
    console.log(session?.currentTask)
  }
  ```

  ```js
  if (window.Clerk.session.currentTask) {
    // Check for pending tasks and display custom UI to help users resolve them
    // See https://clerk.com/docs/custom-flows/overview#session-tasks
    console.log(window.Clerk.session.currentTask)
  }
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Redirecting to tasks

When users have pending session tasks, you can redirect them to specific pages or components to complete these requirements. This is useful when you want to handle session tasks outside of the default `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` components.

#### Using the `taskUrls` option

The `taskUrls` option allows you to specify custom URL paths where users are redirected after sign-up or sign-in when specific session tasks need to be completed. This allows you to still use `<SignIn />` and `<SignUp />` but have tasks with custom pages.

<Tabs items={['layout.tsx', 'choose-organization/page.tsx']}>
  <Tab>
    Configure the `taskUrls` option in your root layout to specify where users should be redirected for different session tasks.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/layout.tsx' }}
    import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider
          publishableKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}
          taskUrls={{
            'choose-organization': '/onboarding/choose-organization',
          }}
        >
          {children}
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    Create a custom page that imports the `TaskChooseOrganization` component to handle the task.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/onboarding/choose-organization/page.tsx' }}
    import { TaskChooseOrganization } from '@clerk/nextjs'

    export default function ChooseOrganizationPage() {
      return <TaskChooseOrganization redirectUrlComplete="/dashboard" />
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Using the `RedirectToTasks` control component

The `<RedirectToTasks />` control component redirects users to the appropriate task page when they have pending session tasks.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/dashboard/layout.tsx' }}
import { SignedOut, RedirectToTasks } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <>
      <SignedOut>
        <RedirectToTasks />
      </SignedOut>
      {children}
    </>
  )
}
```

{/* TODO: Add examples for other sdk's that support middleware */}

#### Middleware-based redirects

For `auth.protect()`, signed-out users will be redirected to the sign-in page. In the following example, `pending` users will be redirected to the sign-in page, where the `<SignIn />` component will prompt them to fulfill the session tasks, which in this case is selecting or creating an organization. Once finished, their session will move from `pending` to an `active` (signed-in) state.

```tsx {{ filename: 'middleware.ts', mark: [[6, 8]] }}
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)', '/forum(.*)'])

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  // pending users won't be able to access protected routes
  // and will be redirected to the sign-in page
  if (isProtectedRoute(req)) await auth.protect()
})

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

For `auth().userId`, it would return `null` if the user has a `pending` session. Pending users will be redirected to the sign-in page, where the `<SignIn />` component will prompt them to fulfill the session tasks. Once finished, their session will move from `pending` to a `signed-in` state.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/middleware.ts', mark: [[6, 12]] }}
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/dashboard(.*)', '/forum(.*)'])

export default clerkMiddleware(async (auth, req) => {
  const { userId, redirectToSignIn } = await auth()

  // pending users will not have a `userId`
  // and will be redirected to the sign-in page
  if (!userId && isProtectedRoute(req)) {
    return redirectToSignIn()
  }
})

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
}
```

### Session handling

You can check the current authentication state using the `Clerk.isSignedIn` property. By default, `pending` sessions are treated as signed-out across Clerk's authentication context. Some control components and authentication utilities accept a `treatPendingAsSignedOut` prop to control how `pending` sessions are handled:

- `true` (default): Treats `pending` sessions as signed-out. Users can't access protected content or routes.
- `false`: Treats `pending` sessions as signed-in. Users can access protected content or routes.

#### Control components

<Tabs items={['<Protect />', '<SignedOut />', '<SignedIn />']}>
  <Tab>
    The [`<Protect />`](/docs/components/protect) component protects content or even entire routes based on a user's authentication state. It will render its children if the user's state is signed-in. It accepts a `fallback` prop that will be rendered if the user's state is signed-out.

    If the user's state is `pending`, they will see the `fallback` content because, by default, `pending` sessions are treated as signed-out.

    ```tsx
    export default function Page() {
      return (
        <Protect fallback={<p>Signed-out and pending users can see this.</p>}>
          <p>Only signed-in users can see this.</p>
        </Protect>
      )
    }
    ```

    If the user's state is `pending`, they will see the protected content because `treatPendingAsSignedOut` is set to `false`.

    ```tsx
    export default function Page() {
      return (
        <Protect
          treatPendingAsSignedOut={false}
          fallback={<p>Users that are signed-out can see this.</p>}
        >
          <p>Users that are signed-in or pending can see this.</p>
        </Protect>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The [`<SignedOut />`](/docs/components/control/signed-out) component renders its children if the user's authentication state is signed-out.

    If the user's state is `pending`, they **will** see the content of the component because, by default, `pending` sessions are treated as signed-out.

    ```tsx
    export default function Page() {
      return (
        <SignedOut>
          <p>Users that are signed-out or pending will see this.</p>
        </SignedOut>
      )
    }
    ```

    If the user's state is `pending`, they **won't** see the content of the component because `treatPendingAsSignedOut` is set to `false`.

    ```tsx
    export default function Page() {
      return (
        <SignedOut treatPendingAsSignedOut={false}>
          <p>Users that are signed-out will see this.</p>
        </SignedOut>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The [`<SignedIn />`](/docs/components/control/signed-in) component renders its children if the user's authentication state is signed-in.

    If the user's state is `pending`, they **won't** see the content of the component because, by default, `pending` sessions are treated as signed-out.

    ```tsx
    export default function Page() {
      return (
        <SignedIn>
          <p>Users that are signed-in will see this.</p>
        </SignedIn>
      )
    }
    ```

    If the user's state is `pending`, they **will** see the content of the component because `treatPendingAsSignedOut` is set to `false`.

    ```tsx
    export default function Page() {
      return (
        <SignedIn treatPendingAsSignedOut={false}>
          <p>Users that are signed-in or pending will see this.</p>
        </SignedIn>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Authentication utilities

The `useAuth()` hook and helpers that access the [`auth` object](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object), such as `getAuth()` or `request.auth`, will return `null` if the user has a `pending` session. Most utilities accept a `treatPendingAsSignedOut` option that defaults to `true`. You can pass `false` to treat `pending` sessions as signed-in.

##### Example: Personal accounts disabled

When organizations are enabled, [personal accounts are disabled by default](/docs/organizations/overview#allow-personal-accounts) and your users will be required to select or create an organization after authenticating. Until completed, their session remains `pending`. Pages that are protected using Clerk's protection utilities will treat the user's session as signed-out.

For `useAuth()`, `userId` will be `null` if the user has a `pending` session.

```tsx
export default function Dashboard() {
  const { isSignedIn, userId } = useAuth()

  if (!userId) {
    return (
      <p>
        User has no session or a pending session. They either need to sign in, or they need to
        complete tasks by selecting or creating an organization.
      </p>
    )
  }

  return (
    <p>
      <p>User has a valid session and {orgId} is defined</p>
    </p>
  )
}
```

<If sdk="nextjs">
  For `auth().userId`, it would return `null` if the user has a `pending` session.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
  import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  export default async function Page() {
    const { userId, orgId } = await auth()

    if (!userId) {
      return (
        <p>
          User has no session or a pending session. They either need to sign in, or they need to
          complete pending session tasks by selecting or creating an organization.
        </p>
      )
    }

    return (
      <p>
        <p>User has a valid session and {orgId} is defined</p>
      </p>
    )
  }
  ```

  By default, users with a `pending` session are treated as signed-out, and their `userId` will not be available. However, in some cases, you may want to access the user's ID even if their session is still `pending`. In these cases, you can set `treatPendingAsSignedOut` to `false`, which will treat `pending` sessions as signed-in and allow you to access the `userId`.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/api/get-teams/route.tsx' }}
  import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

  export const POST = async () => {
    // `treatPendingAsSignedOut` is set to `false` to allow access to the `userId` for pending sessions
    const { userId, has } = await auth({ treatPendingAsSignedOut: false })

    // Check if the user is signed-out
    if (!userId) {
      return Response.json({ error: 'User is signed-out' }, { status: 401 })
    }

    // Now the pending user's `userId` can be used for your use case
    // This is a basic example of creating a resource using the `userId`
    try {
      const newResource = await resources.create({
        userId,
      })

      return Response.json({ data: newResource }, { status: 201 })
    } catch (error) {
      return Response.json({ error: 'Failed to create resource' }, { status: 500 })
    }
  }
  ```
</If>
