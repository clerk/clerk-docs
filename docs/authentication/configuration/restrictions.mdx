# Overview

# Allowlist

The Allowlist feature allows you to control who can get access to your application. It can restrict sign-ups to only a certain set of email addresses or phone numbers that you define. This can be used in a way that acts as a reverse blocklist, only allowing the users added to access your application and blocking all others. (Note: Allowlist is a premium feature and is not available on the Free plan. [Upgrade your plan](https://clerk.com/pricing) to enable this feature.)

    Be aware that turning on the Allowlist feature without adding any identifier exceptions blocks all sign-ups.
</Callout>

Enable this feature by navigating to the [Restrictions](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=/user-authentication/signup-restrictions) screen in the Clerk Dashboard.

After turning on the Allowlist feature, you can add individual email addresses and phone numbers, or whitelist entire email domains.

For example, if you add "clerk.dev" as an allowed email domain, it means that anybody with a "@clerk.dev" email address can sign up for your application. Email addresses from different domains will not be able to sign up.

# Blocklist

The Blocklist feature allows you to control who can get access to your application. It can restrict sign ups for a certain set of email addresses or phone numbers that you define. (Note: Blocklist is a premium feature and is not available on the Free plan. [Upgrade your plan](https://clerk.com/pricing) to enable this feature.)

Enable this feature by navigating to the [Restrictions](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=/user-authentication/signup-restrictions) screen in the Clerk Dashboard.

{/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}

<div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)"}}>![Restrictions configuration screen](/docs/images/setup-clerk/blocklist.png)</div>

After turning on the Blocklist feature, you can add individual email addresses and phone numbers, or blacklist entire email domains.

For example, if you add "clerk.dev" as a blocked email domain, it means that anybody with a "@clerk.dev" email address will not be able to sign up for your application. Email addresses from different domains will not be affected.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
    In the case you have enabled the Allowlist and the Blocklist and have added the same identifier in both, the Allowlist takes precedence.

# Other restrictions

## Block email subaddresses

The Block email subaddresses feature allows you to control who can get access to your application. It can restrict email addresses that contain the characters `+`, `=` or `#` from signing up or being added to existing accounts. Enable this feature by navigating to the [Restrictions](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=/user-authentication/signup-restrictions) screen in the Clerk Dashboard.

{/* Don't move ![] to a new line, otherwise MDX adds a <p> tag and it breaks A11Y */}

<div style={{filter: "drop-shadow(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16) 0px 12px 24px)"}}>![Restrictions configuration screen](/docs/images/setup-clerk/other_restrictions.png)</div>

After turning on the Block email subaddresses feature, any sign ups with an email address that contains a subaddress will be blocked.

For example, an email address like `user+sub@clerk.com` will be blocked.
