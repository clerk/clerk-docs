{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/api/endpoints/SessionApi.ts/#L18 */}

Retrieves a list of sessions. Returns a [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) object with a `data` property that contains an array of [`Session`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-session) objects, and a `totalCount` property that indicates the total number of sessions for the specified user.

```ts
function getSessionList(
  queryParams: SessionListParams,
): Promise<PaginatedResourceResponse<Session[]>>
```

## `SessionListParams`

`getSessionList()` requires either `clientId` or `userId` to be provided.

<Properties>
  - `clientId?`
  - `string`

  The client ID to retrieve the list of sessions for.

  ---

  - `userId?`
  - `string`

  The user ID to retrieve the list of sessions for.

  ---

  - `status?`
  - [`SessionStatus`](#session-status)

  The status of the session.

  ---

  - `limit?`
  - `number`

  The number of results to return. Must be an integer greater than zero and less than 501. Can be used for paginating the results together with `offset`. Defaults to `10`.

  ---

  - `offset?`
  - `number`

  Skip the first `offset` results when paginating. Needs to be an integer greater or equal to zero. To be used in conjunction with `limit`. Defaults to `0`.
</Properties>

### `SessionStatus`

```tsx
type SessionStatus =
  | 'abandoned'
  | 'active'
  | 'ended'
  | 'expired'
  | 'removed'
  | 'replaced'
  | 'revoked'
```

| Value | Description |
| - | - |
| `abandoned` | The session was abandoned client-side. |
| `active` | The session is valid and all activity is allowed. |
| `ended` | The user signed out of the session, but the `Session` remains in the `Client` object. |
| `expired` | The period of allowed activity for this session has passed. |
| `removed` | The user signed out of the session and the `Session` was removed from the `Client` object. |
| `replaced` | The session has been replaced by another one, but the `Session` remains in the `Client` object. |
| `revoked` | The application ended the session and the `Session` was removed from the `Client` object. |

## Examples

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

Retrieve a list of sessions for a specific `userId`:

```tsx
const userId = 'user_123'

const response = await clerkClient.sessions.getSessionList({ userId })
```

### Filter by session status

In this example, a list of sessions with a `status` of `'expired'` is retrieved. You can see that the returned [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) includes `data`, which is an array of [`Session`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-session) objects, and `totalCount`, which indicates the total number of sessions for the specified user.

```tsx {{ mark: [3, 15] }}
const userId = 'user_123'

const status = 'expired'

const response = await clerkClient.sessions.getSessionList({ userId, status })
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/sessions`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Sessions){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
