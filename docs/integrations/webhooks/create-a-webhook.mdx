</TutorialHero>

In this guide, you will learn how to create a Clerk webhook in your Next.js application. You will listen for the `user.updated` event by creating a webhook endpoint in the Clerk Dashboard, creating a webhook handler in your Next.js application, and testing the webhook locally using ngrok and the Clerk Dashboard.

This guide can be adapted to listen for any Clerk event.

## Set up ngrok

To test a webhook locally, you will need to expose your local server to the internet. For this guide, you will use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

1. Go to the [ngrok website](https://ngrok.com/) and create an account.
2. Once you have made it to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup/macos), in navigation sidebar, select [**Domains**](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/domains).
3. Select **Create domain**.
4. ngrok will generate a free, non-ephemeral domain for you and a command to start a tunnel with that domain. The command should look something like this:

`ngrok http --domain=fawn-two-nominally.ngrok-free.app 80`

This command will start a tunnel from `https://fawn-one-nominally.ngrok-free.app` to your local server on port 80.
5. Change the port number to whatever your server is running on. For this guide, change it to 3000 and then run the command in your terminal.
6. Copy your "forwarding" URL. It should look something like `https://fawn-two-nominally.ngrok-free.app`.

## Create an endpoint in the Clerk Dashboard

To create a webhook endpoint, you must provide the **Endpoint URL** and then choose the events you want to listen to. For this guide, you will listen to the `user.updated` event.

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=webhooks).
2. In the navigation sidenav, select **Webhooks**.
3. Select the **Add Endpoint** button.
4. In the **Endpoint URL** field, paste the ngrok URL you copied earlier followed by `/api/webhooks`. This is the endpoint that you will later create, that Svix will send the webhook payload to. The full URL should look something like `https://fawn-two-nominally.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks`.
5. In the **Message Filtering** section, select the `user.updated` event.
6. Select the **Create** button.
7. You will be redirected to your endpoint's settings page. Leave this page open.

## Add your signing secret to your `.env.local` file

To verify the webhook payload, you will need your endpoint's signing secret. However, you do not want to expose this secret in your codebase, so you will want to provide it as an environment variable. In local development, this can be done by storing the secret in the `.env.local` file.

1. On the endpoint's settings page, copy the **Signing Secret**. It should be on the right side of the page with an eye icon next to it.
2. In your project's root directory, you should have an `.env.local` file that includes your Clerk API keys. Here, assign your signing secret to `WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Your file should look something like this:

<InjectKeys>

```sh filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_123
```

</InjectKeys>

## Install `svix`

You will use [`svix`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svix) to verify the webhook signature. Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install svix
  ```

```bash filename="terminal"
yarn add svix
```

```bash filename="terminal"
pnpm add svix
```

</CodeBlockTabs>

## Create a webhook handler

Create a Route Handler that uses `svix` to verify the webhook signature and that receives the webhook's payload.

For the sake of this guide, you will only log the payload to the console. In a real world application, you would use the payload to trigger some action. For example, you are listening for the `user.updated` event, so you could perform a database `update` or `upsert` to update the user's details.

<Callout type="info">
  This Route Handler is not specific to the `user.updated` event and can be used for any webhook event you choose to listen to.
</Callout>

<CodeBlockTabs type="router" options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
```ts filename="app/api/webhooks/route.ts"
import { Webhook } from 'svix'
import { headers } from 'next/headers'
import { WebhookEvent } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export async function POST(req: Request) {

  // You can find this in the Clerk Dashboard -> Webhooks -> choose the endpoint
  const WEBHOOK_SECRET = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET

  if (!WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
    throw new Error('Please add WEBHOOK_SECRET from Clerk Dashboard to .env or .env.local')
  }

  // Get the headers
  const headerPayload = headers();
  const svix_id = headerPayload.get("svix-id");
  const svix_timestamp = headerPayload.get("svix-timestamp");
  const svix_signature = headerPayload.get("svix-signature");

  // If there are no headers, error out
  if (!svix_id || !svix_timestamp || !svix_signature) {
    return new Response('Error occured -- no svix headers', {
      status: 400
    })
  }

  // Get the body
  const payload = await req.json()
  const body = JSON.stringify(payload);

  // Create a new Svix instance with your secret.
  const wh = new Webhook(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

  let evt: WebhookEvent

  // Verify the payload with the headers
  try {
    evt = wh.verify(body, {
      "svix-id": svix_id,
      "svix-timestamp": svix_timestamp,
      "svix-signature": svix_signature,
    }) as WebhookEvent
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error verifying webhook:', err);
    return new Response('Error occured', {
      status: 400
    })
  }

  // Do something with the payload
  // For this guide, you simply log the payload to the console
  const { id } = evt.data;
  const eventType = evt.type;
  console.log(`Webhook with and ID of ${id} and type of ${eventType}`)
  if (evt.type === 'user.updated') {
    console.log('Data from user.updated webhook:', evt.data)
  }

  return new Response('', { status: 200 })
}

```

```ts filename="pages/api/webhooks.ts"
import { Webhook } from 'svix'
import { WebhookEvent } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'
import { buffer } from 'micro'

export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false,
  }
}

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  if (req.method !== 'POST') {
    return res.status(405)
  }
  // You can find this in the Clerk Dashboard -> Webhooks -> choose the webhook
  const WEBHOOK_SECRET = process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET

  if (!WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
    throw new Error('Please add WEBHOOK_SECRET from Clerk Dashboard to .env or .env.local')
  }

  // Get the headers
  const svix_id = req.headers["svix-id"] as string;
  const svix_timestamp = req.headers["svix-timestamp"] as string;
  const svix_signature = req.headers["svix-signature"] as string;


  // If there are no headers, error out
  if (!svix_id || !svix_timestamp || !svix_signature) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Error occured -- no svix headers' })
  }

  console.log('headers', req.headers, svix_id, svix_signature, svix_timestamp)
  // Get the body
  const body = (await buffer(req)).toString()

  // Create a new Svix instance with your secret.
  const wh = new Webhook(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

  let evt: WebhookEvent

  // Verify the payload with the headers
  try {
    evt = wh.verify(body, {
      "svix-id": svix_id,
      "svix-timestamp": svix_timestamp,
      "svix-signature": svix_signature,
    }) as WebhookEvent
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error verifying webhook:', err);
    return res.status(400).json({ 'Error': err })
  }

  // Do something with the payload
  // For this guide, you simply log the payload to the console
  const { id } = evt.data;
  const eventType = evt.type;
  console.log(`Webhook with and ID of ${id} and type of ${eventType}`)
  console.log('Webhook body:', body)

  return res.status(200).json({ response: 'Success' })
}
```

## Test your webhook

1. Start your Next.js server.
2. On your endpoint's settings page in the Clerk Dashboard, select the **Testing** tab.
3. In the **Select event** dropdown, select `user.updated`.
4. Select the **Send Example** button.
5. Below that section, in the **Message Attempts** section, you should see a successful attempt with a status of `200`.

### Message failed

If the message failed:

1. Select the message.
2. Scroll down to the **Webhook Attempts** section.
3. Select the arrow icon the left side.
4. Investigate the error. Your solution is going to depend on the error message.

## Trigger your webhook

To trigger the `user.updated` event, you can do one of the following:
1. You can edit your user in the Dashboard.
2. You can use the `<UserProfile />` component in your application to edit your profile.

Once you have updated a user, you should be able to see the webhook's payload logged to your terminal. You can also check the Clerk Dashboard to see the webhook attempt, the same way you did when [testing the webhook](#test-your-webhook).

## Wrap up

In this guide, you learned how to create a Clerk webhook using Svix. You created a webhook in the Clerk Dashboard to listen for the `user.updated` event and created a Route Handler for your webhook endpoint to verify the webhook signature and receive the payload. You tested the webhook locally using ngrok and the Clerk Dashboard to ensure it was configured properly. And lastly, you added logic to your application to actually trigger the `user.updated` event. Now, you can do whatever you want with the webhook payload, such as sending a notification to your users, updating a database, or anything else you can think of.
