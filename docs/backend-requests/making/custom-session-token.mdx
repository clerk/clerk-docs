# Customize your session token

Session tokens are JWTs generated by Clerk on behalf of your instance, and convey an authenticated user session to your backend.

They typically contain a standard set of claims that are required for Clerk to function. However, you can customize them and retrieve the data at any point.

### Using the custom claims in your application

Now that you have added the custom claims to your session token, you can use them in your application. Below is an example of how you can access the custom claims in your application.

#### Using `getAuth` in your Next.js application

```tsx fileName=pages/api/example.ts
import { getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { sessionClaims } = getAuth(req);

  const firstName = sessionClaims.fullName;

  const primaryEmail = sessionClaims.primaryEmail;

  return res.status(200).json({ firstName, primaryEmail })
}
```

</Steps>
