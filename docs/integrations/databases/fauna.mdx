# Integrate Fauna with Clerk

The first step is to create a new Clerk application from your Clerk Dashboard if you haven’t done so already. You can choose whichever authentication strategy and social sign-in providers you prefer. For more information, check out our [Set up your application](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk) guide.

After your Clerk application has been created, in the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the **[API keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)** page and copy your **Publishable key**.

  alt="The API keys page in the Clerk Dashboard. There is a red arrow pointing to the copy button next to the 'Publishable key'."
/>

The next step is to head over to the Fauna database that you want Clerk-authenticated users to access. Click on the **Security** link on the left-hand navigation and then the **Providers** tab.

  alt="The Security page in the Fauna dashboard. The Providers tab is the active tab."
/>

Click the **New Access Provider** button.

Enter a name in the **Name** field that will identify this access provider. The recommendation is to use “Clerk”.

Paste the **Publishable key** you copied from the Clerk Dashboard into the **Issuer** field and then prefix it with the `https://` protocol so it follows `https://<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>`

<Callout type="info">
  Make sure you do not add a trailing slash / to the end of the Issuer URL or it will fail.
</Callout>

Assuming you didn’t use a custom signing key, set the **JWKS endpoint** field to the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) URL Clerk automatically created with your Frontend API at `https://<YOUR_FRONTEND_API>/.well-known/jwks.json`

You can find this URL in the Clerk Dashboard on the **[API keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys)** page. Scroll down and click on **Advanced**. In the **JWT public key** section, copy the **JWKS URL**.

  height={1648}
  src="/docs/images/integrations/jwks-url.webp"
  alt="The API Keys page in the Clerk Dashboard. A red box outlines the 'Advanced' drop down button. A red arrow is pointing to the copy button next to 'JWKS URL' in the 'JWT public key' section."
/>

The last part is to select a role that will be assigned to authenticated users. The [Role](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/cookbook/advanced/security/user-roles) defines the access privileges and domain-specific security rules. You can specify multiple roles if necessary.

The completed provider form should resemble the following:

/>

Before clicking the **Save** button, copy the **Audience URL** and then go ahead and save.

## Create a new Fauna JWT template

In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the **[JWT Templates](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=jwt-templates)** page. Click on the **New template** button to create a new template based on Fauna.

  height={1648}
  src="/docs/images/integrations/fauna/jwt-templates.webp"
  alt="The JWT Templates page in the Clerk Dashboard. The 'New template' button was clicked, and a pop up titled 'New JWT template' is shown. The 'Fauna' template is hovered over."
/>

Once the Convex template is created, you will be redirected to the template's page. You can now configure the template to your needs.

<Images
  width={3024}
  height={1648}
  src="/docs/images/integrations/fauna/create-template.webp"
  alt="The 'Create new template' page of the JWT Templates page in the Clerk Dashboard."
/>

Scroll down to the **Claims** section and set the `aud` claim to the **Audience URL** you copied from Fauna. The URL format should be `https://db.fauna.com/db/<YOUR_FAUNA_DB_ID>`.

<Images
  width={3024}
  height={1648}
  src="/docs/images/integrations/fauna/template-shortcodes.webp"
  alt="The 'Create new template' page of the JWT Templates page in the Clerk Dashboard. The page is scrolled down to the 'Claims' section."
/>

You can include additional claims if you’d like, but `aud` is the only required one. [Shortcodes](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates#shortcodes) are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.

Don't forget to click the **Apply changes** button at the bottom right to save your Fauna JWT template.

## Authenticating Fauna queries

The way to authenticate requests to Fauna with Clerk is to use a JWT. After adding the necessary claims in a JWT template, you can generate the token by calling the `getToken` method from the [`useAuth()`](/docs/references/react/use-auth) hook provided by Clerk.

```jsx {{ prettier: false }}
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs';
import faunadb from 'faunadb';
const q = faunadb.query;

const Example = () => {
  const { getToken } = useAuth();
  const [userId, setUserId] = React.useState();
  const makeQuery = async () => {
    try {
      // TODO: Update with your JWT template name
      const secret = await getToken({ template: 'fauna' });
      const client = new faunadb.Client({ secret, keepAlive: false });
      const id = await client.query(q.CurrentIdentity());
      setUserId(id);
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle error
      setUserId(null);
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={makeQuery}>Make authenticated query</button>
      <p>User ID: {userId}</p>
    </>
  );
};
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `getToken({ template: <your-template-name> })` call is asynchronous and returns a Promise that needs to be resolved before accessing the token value. This token is short-lived for better security and should be called before every request to your Fauna database. The caching and refreshing of the token are handled automatically by Clerk.
</Callout>

## Next steps

- Replace the [Fauna JavaScript driver](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/drivers/) with a GraphQL client like [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) or [graphql-request](https://github.com/jasonkuhrt/graphql-request).
- Try adding some [custom claims](/docs/backend-requests/making/jwt-templates) to the JWT token.
