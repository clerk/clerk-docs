---

The `SignUp` object holds the state of the current sign-up and provides helper methods to navigate and complete the sign-up process. Once a sign-up is complete, a new user is created.

The following steps outline the sign-up process:

1. Initiate the sign-up process by collecting the user's authentication information and passing the appropriate parameters to the [`create()`](#create) method.
1. Prepare the [verification](#verification).
1. Attempt to complete the verification.
1. If the verification is successful, set the newly created session as the active session by passing the `SignIn.createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object.

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `id`
  - `string | undefined`

  The unique identifier of the current sign-up.

  ---

  - `status`
  - `'missing_requirements' | 'complete' | 'abandoned' | null`

  The status of the current sign-up. The following values are supported:

  - `complete:` The user has been created and the custom flow can proceed to `setActive()` to create session.
  - `missing_requirements:` A requirement is unverified or missing from the [**Email, Phone, Username**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) settings. For example, in the Clerk Dashboard, the **Password** setting is required but a password wasn't provided in the custom flow.
  - `abandoned:` The sign-up has been inactive for over 24 hours.

  ---

  - `requiredFields`
  - `string[]`

  An array of all the required fields that need to be supplied and verified in order for this sign-up to be marked as complete and converted into a user.

  ---

  - `optionalFields`
  - `string[]`

  An array of all the fields that can be supplied to the sign-up, but their absence does not prevent the sign-up from being marked as complete.

  ---

  - `missingFields`
  - `string[]`

  An array of all the fields whose values are not supplied yet but they are mandatory in order for a sign-up to be marked as complete.

  ---

  - `unverifiedFields`
  - `string[]`

  An array of all the fields whose values have been supplied, but they need additional verification in order for them to be accepted. Examples of such fields are `emailAddress` and `phoneNumber`.

  ---

  - `verifications`
  - `SignUpVerifications`

  An object that contains information about all the verifications that are in-flight.

  ---

  - `username`
  - `string | null`

  The username supplied to the current sign-up. Only supported if [username](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#identifiers) is enabled in the instance settings.

  ---

  - `emailAddress`
  - `string | null`

  The email address supplied to the current sign-up. Only supported if [email address](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#identifiers) is enabled in the instance settings.

  ---

  - `phoneNumber`
  - `string | null`

  The user's phone number in [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164). Only supported if [phone number](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#identifiers) is enabled in the instance settings.

  ---

  - `web3Wallet`
  - `string | null`

  The Web3 wallet address, made up of 0x + 40 hexadecimal characters. Only supported if [Web3 authentication](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#web3-authentication) is enabled in the instance settings.

  ---

  - `hasPassword`
  - `boolean`

  The value of this attribute is true if a password was supplied to the current sign-up. Only supported if [password](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#authentication-strategies) is enabled in the instance settings.

  ---

  Metadata that can be read and set from the frontend. Once the sign-up is complete, the value of this field will be automatically copied to the newly created user's unsafe metadata. One common use case for this attribute is to use it to implement custom fields that can be collected during sign-up and will automatically be attached to the created User object.

  ---

  - `createdSessionId`
  - `string | null`

## Methods

### `create()`

Returns a new `SignUp` object based on the `params` you pass to it, stores the sign-up lifecycle state in the `status` property, and deactivates any existing sign-up process the client may already have in progress. Use this method to initiate a new sign-up process.

What you must pass to `params` depends on which [sign-up options](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options) you have enabled in your Clerk application instance.

Optionally, you can complete the sign-up process in one step if you supply the required fields to `create()`. Otherwise, Clerk's sign-up process provides great flexibility and allows users to easily create multi-step sign-up flows.

> [!WARNING]
> Once the sign-up process is complete, pass the `createdSessionId` to the [`setActive()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods#set-active) method on the `Clerk` object. This will set the newly created session as the active session.

```typescript
function create(params: SignUpCreateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### `SignUpCreateParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'oauth_<provider>' | 'saml' | 'enterprise_sso' | 'ticket' | 'google_one_tap'`

  The strategy to use for the sign-up flow. The following strategies are supported:

  - `'oauth_<provider>'`: The user will be authenticated with their [social connection account](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview). See a list of [supported values for `<provider>`](/docs/references/javascript/types/oauth).
  - `'saml'` (deprecated): **Deprecated in favor of `'enterprise_sso'`.** The user will be authenticated with their [SAML account](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/overview#saml).
  - `'enterprise_sso'`: The user will be authenticated either through SAML or OIDC depending on the configuration of their [enterprise SSO account](/docs/authentication/enterprise-connections/overview).
  - `'ticket'`: The user will be authenticated via the ticket _or token_ generated from the Backend API.
  - `'google_one_tap'`: The user will be authenticated with the Google One Tap UI. It's recommended to use [`authenticateWithGoogleOneTap()`](/docs/components/authentication/google-one-tap#authenticate-with-google-one-tap) instead, as it will also set the user's current session as active for you.

  ---

  - `firstName`
  - `string | null`

  ---

  - `phoneNumber`
  - `string | null`

  The user's phone number in [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164). Only supported if [phone number](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#identifiers) is enabled. Keep in mind that the phone number requires an extra verification process.

  ---

  - `web3Wallet`
  - `string | null`

  ---

  - `username`
  - `string | null`

  The user's username. Only supported if [usernames](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#identifiers) are enabled.

  ---

  - `unsafeMetadata`
  - [`SignUpUnsafeMetadata`](/docs/references/javascript/types/metadata#sign-up-unsafe-metadata)

  Metadata that can be read and set from the frontend. Once the sign-up is complete, the value of this field will be automatically copied to the newly created user's unsafe metadata. One common use case for this attribute is to use it to implement custom fields that can be collected during sign-up and will automatically be attached to the created `User` object.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl`
  - `string`

  If `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`, this specifies full URL or path that the OAuth provider should redirect to after successful authorization on their part. Typically, this will be a simple `/sso-callback` route that either calls [`Clerk.handleRedirectCallback`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/handle-navigation#handle-redirect-callback) or mounts the [`<AuthenticateWithRedirectCallback />`](/docs/components/control/authenticate-with-callback) component. See the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/oauth-connections) for implementation details.

  If `strategy` is set to `'email_link'`, this specifies The full URL that the user will be redirected to when they visit the email link. See the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/email-links) for implementation details.

  ---

  - `actionCompleteRedirectUrl`
  - `string`

  **Optional** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The full URL or path that the user will be redirected to after successful authorization from the OAuth provider and Clerk sign-in.

  ---

  ---

  - `legalAccepted`
  - `boolean`

  A boolean indicating whether the user has agreed to the [legal compliance](/docs/authentication/configuration/legal-compliance) documents.

  ---

  - `string`

  **Optional** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The value to pass to the [OIDC `prompt` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=prompt,reauthentication%20and%20consent.) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.

  ---

  - `oidcLoginHint`
  - `string`

  **Optional** if `strategy` is set to `'oauth_<provider>'` or `'enterprise_sso'`. The value to pass to the [OIDC `login_hint` parameter](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#:~:text=login_hint,in%20\(if%20necessary\).) in the generated OAuth redirect URL.
</Properties>

### `update()`

This method is used to update the current sign-up.

As with `create`, the form of the given `params` depends on the configuration of the instance.

```typescript
function update(params: SignUpUpdateParams): Promise<SignUpResource>
```

#### `SignUpUpdateParams`

`SignUpUpdateParams` is a mirror of [`SignUpCreateParams`](#sign-up-create-params) with the same fields and types.

### `createEmailLinkFlow()`

```typescript
function createEmailLinkFlow(): {
  startEmailLinkFlow: (params: StartEmailLinkFlowParams) => Promise<SignUp>
  cancelEmailLinkFlow: () => void
}
```

Sets up a sign-up with email link flow. Calling `createEmailLinkFlow()` will return two functions.

The first function is async and starts the email link flow, preparing an email link verification. It sends the email link email and starts polling for verification results. The signature is `startEmailLinkFlow({ redirectUrl: string }) => Promise<SignUpResource>`.

The second function can be used to stop polling at any time, allowing for full control of the flow and cleanup. The signature is `cancelEmailLinkFlow() => void`.

```typescript
function createEmailLinkFlow(): {
  startEmailLinkFlow: (params: StartEmailLinkFlowParams) => Promise<SignUpResource>
  cancelEmailLinkFlow: () => void
}
```

#### `createEmailLinkFlow()` returns

`createEmailLinkFlow` returns an object with two functions:

<Properties>
  - `startEmailLinkFlow`
  - <code>(params: [StartEmailLinkFlowParams](#start-email-link-flow-params)) => Promise\<SignUp></code>

  Function to start the email link flow. It prepares an email link verification and polls for the verification result.
</Properties>

#### `StartEmailLinkFlowParams`

<Properties>
  - `redirectUrl`
  - `string`

  The full URL that the user will be redirected to when they visit the email link.
</Properties>
