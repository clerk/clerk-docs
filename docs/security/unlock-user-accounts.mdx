# Unlock user accounts from the Clerk Dashboard

<Callout type="info">
This feature is applicable to user accounts that use [passwords](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) or [backup codes](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/multi-factor).
</Callout>

Users with admin roles can override lockouts through the Clerk dashboard.

1. In your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/), navigate to **[Users](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=users)**.
2. Locate the locked user by looking for a "locked" badge next to their username/email. 
3. Open the admin menu (three little dots).
4. Select "Unlock" to unlock the user account.
