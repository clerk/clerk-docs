description: Learn how to integrate Clerk into your Vercel projects through the Vercel Marketplace.

The Vercel Marketplace allows Vercel users to install and configure third-party services, like Clerk, directly from the Vercel dashboard. Clerk offers an [official integration](https://vercel.com/marketplace/clerk) that Vercel users can install to integrate Clerk into their Vercel projects.

## Installing the Clerk Integration

> [!TIP]
> Deploy an example Next.js application and install the Clerk integration with our template.

1. Navigate to the [Clerk integration](https://vercel.com/marketplace/clerk) in the Vercel Marketplace.
1. Click **Install** to add Clerk to your Vercel team.
1. Select your pricing plan.
1. Provide a name for your Clerk application.
1. Click **Create**.

Vercel will automatically provision a Clerk account, organization, and application for you. Vercel calls the provisioned application a **Resource**.

Each Vercel team has an associated Clerk Organization. When you open the Clerk Dashboard from the Vercel Marketplace, Clerk will automatically provision a new account for you, or link to an existing Clerk account if an account is found with the same email address. An equivalent role in Clerk is assigned to the user based on their Vercel team role. Roles and Vercel team membership are automatically synced to Clerk.

## Connecting to your Vercel projects

Once you've installed and provisioned a Clerk application, you will need to connect it to one of your Vercel projects. Generally, a Clerk application should be connected to a single Vercel project. Clerk will manage multiple instances for you that map to Vercel's environments: Clerk's development instance maps to Vercel's development and preview environments, and the production instance maps to Vercel's production environment.

Connecting to a project will automatically sync your Clerk API keys to your Vercel project's environment variables. The following environment variables will be automatically synced to each environment:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
CLERK_SECRET_KEY
```

> [!TIP]
> Running `vercel env pull` in your project will automatically sync the development environment variables locally.

## Configuring your Clerk application

Most of your Clerk application configuration will be done through the Clerk Dashboard. To access the Dashboard after installing the Clerk integration, navigate to your installation details page and click the **Open in Clerk** button.

Refer to the [Configuration documentation](/docs/authentication/overview) for more information on configuring your application.

## Pricing

The pricing for plans and add-ons purchased through the Vercel Marketplace is the same as the pricing when purchased directly through Clerk. For more information on Clerk's pricing and available plans, see the [Pricing page](/pricing).

Billing and usage data are reported hourly to Vercel and can be viewed directly in the Vercel Dashboard.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when using Clerk through the Vercel Marketplace:

- Vercel-managed Organizations cannot be deleted from the Clerk Dashboard, they can only be deleted by uninstalling the Clerk integration.
- Vercel-managed Applications cannot be deleted from the Clerk Dashboard, they can only be deleted by uninstalling the Resource from the Vercel Dashboard.
