[nOAuth](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth) is an exploit in Microsoft Entra ID OAuth apps that can lead to account takeovers via email address spoofing. Clerk mitigates this risk by enforcing stricter checks on verified email addresses.

For further security, Microsoft offers an optional `xms_edov` [claim](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/optional-claims-reference), which provides additional context to determine whether the returned email is verified.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When adding the `xms_edov` claim in the Azure portal, you may see a warning saying it's invalid or not recognized. You can safely ignore this warning - `xms_edov` is fully supported and documented by Microsoft Entra ID for stronger email domain verification, but the Azure portal's token configuration UI may not recognize it yet.

To enable it, you must:

1. In the left sidenav, in the **Manage** dropdown, select **Token configuration**.
1. Select **Add optional claim**.
1. For the **Token type**, select **ID**. Then, in the table that opens, enable the `email` and `xms_pdl` claims.
1. At the bottom of the modal, select **Add**. A new modal will prompt you to turn on the Microsoft Graph email permission. Enable it, then select **Add** to complete the form.
1. Repeat the previous steps but for **Token type**, select **Access** instead of **ID**. The **Optional claims** list should now show two claims for `email` and two for `xms_pdl`: one each for **ID** and **Access**.
1. In the left sidenav, in the **Manage** dropdown, select **Manifest**.
1. In the text editor, search for `"acceptMappedClaims"` and set its value from `null` to `true`.
1. Search for `"optionalClaims"`, where you'll find the `idToken` and `accessToken` arrays. Each array has an object with the name `xms_pdl`. Change the name to `xms_edov`.
1. At the top of the page, select **Save**.
1. In the left sidenav, in the **Manage** dropdown, select **Token configuration** to confirm that the **Optional claims** list includes two claims for `email` and two for `xms_edov`: one each for **ID** and **Access**.

With these steps complete, Microsoft will send the `xms_edov` claim in the token, which Clerk will use to determine whether the email is verified, even when used with Microsoft Entra ID.
