`OrganizationCustomPermissionKey` is a type that represents a user's Permission in an organization. It will be string unless the developer has provided their own types through [`ClerkAuthorization`](/docs/guides/development/override-clerk-types-interfaces#example-custom-roles-and-permissions).

Clerk provides [default System Permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/roles-and-permissions#system-permissions). However, you can create [Custom Permissions](/docs/guides/organizations/roles-and-permissions#custom-permissions) as well.
