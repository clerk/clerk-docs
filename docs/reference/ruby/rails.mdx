title: Ruby on Rails integration
description: The Clerk Ruby SDK provides a Rack middleware and a gem to integrate Clerk into your Rails app.
sdk: ruby
---

The Clerk Ruby SDK provides a seamless integration with Ruby on Rails through a Rack middleware and dedicated Rails helpers. When you add the Clerk gem to your Rails application, the middleware is automatically included in your application's middleware stack.

<Steps>
  ## Install `clerk-sdk-ruby`

  <Include src="_partials/ruby/installation" />

  ## Configuration

  <Include src="_partials/ruby/configuration" />
</Steps>

## Example: Access the `clerk` object

To access Clerk's authentication functionality in your controllers, include the `Clerk::Authenticatable` concern. This gives your controller and views access to the `clerk` helper, which provides access to the current session claims such as `clerk.user` and `clerk.organization`.

```ruby {{ filename: 'app/controllers/application_controller.rb' }}
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include Clerk::Authenticatable

  private

  # If the user is not authenticated, redirect to the sign-in page
  def require_clerk_session!
    # The `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` env var must be set or the `sign_in_url` method will fail
    redirect_to clerk.sign_in_url unless clerk.session
  end
end
```

## Example: Protect routes

To protect specific controllers or actions, you can add a `before_action` callback that uses the `require_clerk_session!` method to check for an authenticated Clerk session. This is particularly useful for securing admin sections or sensitive operations.

```ruby
class AdminController < ApplicationController
  # Protect routes with the `require_clerk_session!` method
  before_action :require_clerk_session!

  def index
    # ...
  end
end
```

## Example: Reverification

For actions requiring additional security, Clerk provides a `:require_reverification!` filter that prompts users to re-authenticate. This filter accepts an optional [preset](/docs/reference/ruby/overview#reverification) parameter to customize the reverification requirements.

In the following example, all actions in the `AdminController` will be protected from unauthenticated users. If the user is authenticated, they will be required to reverify their session before accessing the `destroy` action.

```ruby
class AdminController < ApplicationController
  # Protect routes with the `require_clerk_session!` method
  before_action :require_clerk_session!
  # Protect `destroy` with the `require_reverification!` method
  # Reverification preset is set to `LAX`
  before_action :require_reverification!, only: :destroy, preset: Clerk::StepUp::Preset::LAX


  def index
    # ...
  end

  def destroy
    # ...
  end
end
```
