## OpenID Connect (OIDC)

After a user successfully authenticates using the OIDC flow, they receive an ID token along with other tokens.

The ID token is a JWT (JSON Web Token) that contains standard JWT claims as defined in RFC 7519, as well as additional custom claims that represent the authenticated user's profile information. The token is signed using your instance's private key.

You must validate the ID token before using any of the user information it contains. Validation requires verifying the token signature using your instance's public key. You can find your instance's public key at `https://clerk.<INSERT_YOUR_APP_DOMAIN>.com/.well-known/jwks.json`.

The ID token includes the following standard claims:

| Standard claim | Description |
| - | - |
| `iss` | The issuer of the token, which matches your Clerk Frontend API URL |
| `sub` | The subject of the token, which matches the authenticated user ID |
| `aud` | The intended audience of the token, which matches the used Client ID |
| `exp` | The expiration time of the token |
| `iat` | The time at which the token was issued |
| `jti` | A unique identifier for the token |

Depending on the granted scopes, the ID token can include the following additional claims:

| Additional claim | Description |
| - | - |
| `nonce` | The nonce provided and used during the request |
| `family_name` | The user's last name |
| `given_name` | The user's first name |
| `name` | The user's full name |
| `picture` | The user's avatar URL |
| `preferred_username` | The user's username |
| `email` | The user's primary email address |
| `email_verified` | Whether the user's primary email address is verified |
| `public_metadata` | The user's public metadata |
| `private_metadata` | The user's private metadata |
| `unsafe_metadata` | The user's unsafe metadata |

### OIDC prompt

As part of an OIDC request, you can indicate the desired sign-in experience for the user by using the `prompt` parameter. The following values are supported:

- `none`: The user doesn't interact with the provider, thus they need to have an active session already. If not, the provider responds with an error.
- `login`: The user is forced to re-authenticate, even if they already have an active session. If there was already an active session, the provider ends it.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
