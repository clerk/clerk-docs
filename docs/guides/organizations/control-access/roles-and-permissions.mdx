Roles and Permissions let you control who can access specific resources and perform certain actions within each Organization. Clerk provides two default Roles - **admin** and **member** - that cover most common use cases. You can also create custom Roles and fine-grained Permissions that fit your application's specific features and team setup.

## Roles

Each Role defines what users can do and access within an Organization. You can extend a Role's capabilities by adding [Permissions](#permissions).

### Default Roles

When users create or join Organizations, they need to be assigned a Role. These settings determine which Roles are automatically assigned in different scenarios, whether someone is creating a new Organization or joining an existing one.

For each instance, there are currently two default Roles:

- **Admin (`org:admin`)** - Offers full access to Organization resources. Members with the admin Role have all of the [System Permissions](#system-permissions). They can fully manage the Organization and Organization memberships.
- **Member (`org:member`)** - Offers limited access to Organization resources. Access to Organization resources is limited to the "Read members" and "Read billing" Permissions only, by default. They cannot manage the Organization and Organization memberships, but they can view information about other members in it.

### The **Creator** Role

When a user creates a new Organization, Clerk automatically adds them as its first member and assigns them the Organization's designated **Creator** Role. By default, that Role is `org:admin`.

You cannot delete an Organization Role if it's used as the Organization's **Creator** Role. But, you _can_ reassign the **Creator** Role to any other Role with the right Permissions. For example, if you want to delete the `admin` Role, you will have to assign another Role as the **Creator** Role.

The **Creator** Role must _at least_ have the following [System Permissions](#system-permissions):

- Manage members (`org:sys_memberships:manage`)
- Read members (`org:sys_memberships:read`)
- Delete Organization (`org:sys_profile:delete`)

To reassign the **Creator** Role:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to [**Roles & Permissions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings/roles).
1. [Create a new Role](#custom-roles) or use an existing Role from the list.
1. Ensure that **Manage members**, **Read members**, and **Delete Organization** System Permissions are selected for the Role.
1. Open the three dots icon for the Role.
1. From the dropdown, select the **Set as Creator role** option.

### The **Default** Role for members

New Organization members are initially assigned the **Default** Role. By default, that Role is `org:member`. This Role is used as a pre-filled default in `<OrganizationProfile />` invitations and for Organization enrollment with [Verified Domains](/docs/guides/organizations/add-members/verified-domains).

You cannot delete an Organization Role if it's used as the Organization's **Default** Role. But, you _can_ reassign the **Default** Role to any other Role.

To reassign the **Default** Role:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to [**Roles & Permissions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings/roles).
1. [Create a new Role](#custom-roles) or use an existing Role from the list.
1. Select the three dots next to the Role you want to set as default.
1. From the dropdown, select the **Set as Default role** option.

### Custom Roles

You can create up to 10 custom Organization Roles per application instance to meet your application needs. If you need more than 10 Roles, [contact support](/contact/support){{ target: '_blank' }}.

Custom Roles can be granted Permissions and access. For example, you can create a new Role of **Billing** (`org:billing`) which can be used to group users who belong to a specific department of the Organization and have permission to manage credit card information, invoices, and other resources related to billing.

To create a new Role:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to [**Roles & Permissions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings/roles)
1. Select **Add role**.
1. Give the Role a name, a key to reference it by, and a description. The final key will follow the format `org:<role>`.
1. Select **Save**.

### Change a user's Role

You can change a user's Role in the Clerk Dashboard, or in your application using the [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/reference/components/organization/organization-switcher) component.

To change a user's Role in the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, select [**Organizations**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations) and select an organization.
1. Select the **Members** tab.
1. In the list of members, find the one whose Role you want to change.
1. Select another Role from their Role dropdown.

### Delete a Role

You cannot delete a Role that is still assigned to members of an Organization. Change the members to a different Role before completing the following steps.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to [**Roles & Permissions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings/roles).
1. Select the three dots icon next to the Role.
1. Select **Delete role**.

## Permissions

Permissions grant users privileged access to resources and operations, like creating and deleting. Clerk supports two types of Permissions: **System Permissions** and **Custom Permissions**.

### System Permissions

Clerk provides a set of System Permissions that power [Clerk's Frontend API](/docs/reference/frontend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} and [organization-related Clerk components](/docs/reference/components/overview). These Permissions serve as the baseline required for Clerk to operate effectively.

Clerk's System Permissions consist of the following:

- Manage Organization (`org:sys_profile:manage`)
- Delete Organization (`org:sys_profile:delete`)
- Read members (`org:sys_memberships:read`)
- Manage members (`org:sys_memberships:manage`)
- Read domains (`org:sys_domains:read`)
- Manage domains (`org:sys_domains:manage`)
- Read billing (`org:sys_billing:read`)
- Manage billing (`org:sys_billing:manage`)

You can assign these System Permissions to any Role.

> [!WARNING]
> System Permissions aren't included in [session claims](/docs/guides/sessions/session-tokens#default-claims). If you need to check Permissions on the server-side, you must [create Custom Permissions](#custom-permissions) for authorization checks in your application code.

### Custom Permissions

Custom Permissions let you define fine-tuned access control within your Organization. Each Permission is tied to a Feature, and can be assigned to one or more Roles. To create a Custom Permission, you must first create a Role (e.g. **sales**) and a Feature within that Role (e.g. **invoices**). Once both exist, you can define specific Permissions (e.g. **create**) related to that Feature. To assign a Custom Permission to a user, you must assign the user to the Role that has the Permission.

To create a new Permission:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to [**Roles & Permissions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/organizations-settings/roles).
1. [Create a new Role](#custom-roles) or use an existing Role from the list.
1. Under **Custom permissions**, select **Create permission** under the Feature you want to create the Permission for. If there are no Features, you'll need to create a new one first. Select **Create feature** and fill in the required fields. Once finished, the newly created Feature will appear in the list, and the **Create permission** button will appear.
1. Give the Permission a name, a key to reference it by, and a description. The final key will follow the format `org:<feature>:<permission>`.
   > [!NOTE]
   > Common Permission values could be:
   >
   > - `create` — to allow creating resources
   > - `read` — to allow reading/viewing resources
   > - `update/manage` — to allow updating/editing resources
   > - `delete` — to allow deleting resources
   >
   > For example, you could create a new Permission called **Create invoices** (`org:invoices:create`) which allows only users with this Permission to edit invoices. Then, you could assign this Permission to a Role, or multiple Roles, such as **Billing** (`org:billing`) or **Sales** (`org:sales`).
1. Select **Create permission**.

You can also create a Custom Permission by navigating to the [**Features**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/features) tab in the Clerk Dashboard.

## Verify a user's Role or Permission

It's best practice to always verify whether or not a user is **authorized** to access sensitive information, important content, or exclusive features. **Authorization** is the process of determining the access rights and privileges of a user, ensuring they have the necessary Permissions to perform specific actions. To perform authorization checks using a user's Role or Permission, see the [guide on authorizing users](/docs/guides/secure/authorization-checks).
