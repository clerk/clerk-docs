  - Use X/Twitter v2 to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Clerk does not currently support preconfigured shared OAuth credentials for X/Twitter on development instances. This means you will have to provide custom credentials for both development _and_ production instances, which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your X/Twitter Developer account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [X/Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).

> [!WARNING]
> X/Twitter v2 is currently not providing email addresses of users. The user will have to fill in their email address manually when they return to your application after authenticating with X/Twitter.

<Steps>
  ## Enable X/Twitter as a social connection

  To enable X/Twitter as a social connection for your Clerk application:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **X/Twitter**.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ## Create an X/Twitter application

  If you don't have an existing X/Twitter application you've set up for social connection, you need to register a new one in the [X/Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). Note that the process requires approval from X/Twitter before your new application can be used.

  To create a new X/Twitter application:

  1. In the X/Twitter Developer Portal, navigate to [**Projects & Apps**](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps).
  1. Select **+ Add App**. After entering an application name, you'll be presented with your app's credentials. However, for setting up the X/Twitter v2 social connection with Clerk, **you won't need these credentials**. This is because you will be utilizing the OAuth 2.0 flow, which relies on different authentication details.
  1. Scroll down to the **User authentication settings** section and select **Set up**. You'll be redirected to the **User authentication settings** page.
  1. Under **App permissions**, you can choose the permissions you want to request from the user. For this tutorial, select the **Read** permission.
  1. Under **Type of App**, select **Web App, Automated App or Bot**.
  1. Under **App info**, in the **Callback URI / Redirect URL** input, paste the **Redirect URI** value you copied from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Fill in any other required fields, such as the **Website URL**, and select **Save**.

  ## Set the Client ID and Client Secret in the Clerk Dashboard

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/set-client-id-secret" />

  ## Test your connection

  <Include src="_partials/authentication/test-your-connection" />
