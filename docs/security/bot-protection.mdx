To protect your sign-ups from bots, Clerk leverages data from our CDN to determine whether a user attempting to sign up might be a bot or not.

## Enable bot sign-up protection

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Attack protection**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/attack-protection) page.
1. Enable the **Bot sign-up protection** toggle.
   - When enabled, users suspected of being a bot will be shown an interactive challenge (like clicking a checkbox) to verify they are human. The CAPTCHA widget will only be shown if the client is suspected to be a bot.

> [!WARNING]
> If you currently have the **Invisible** CAPTCHA type selected, it's highly recommended to switch to the **Smart** option, as the **Invisible** option is deprecated and will be removed in a future update.

## Limitations

- Device emulation in a browser is [not supported by Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/cloudflare-challenges/#mobile-device-emulation), which Clerk uses for bot detection.
- If you're building a custom sign-up flow using the Clerk API, instead of using Clerk components, and you have enabled **Bot sign-up protection**, then you need to ensure you have added a DOM node to render the CAPTCHA widget. Refer to the [Add bot protection to your custom sign-up flow](/docs/custom-flows/bot-sign-up-protection) guide for more information.
