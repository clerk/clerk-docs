## Tutorial

<Steps>
  ### Set up an enterprise connection in Clerk

  To create a SAML connection in Clerk:

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
  1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
  1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For specific domains**.
  1. Select **Google Workspace** as the identity provider.
  1. Add the **Name** of the connection. This is the name that will be displayed in the sign-in form.
  1. Add the **Specific Domain** that you want to allow this connection for. This is the domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your application.
  1. Select **Add connection**. You will be redirected to the connection's configuration page.

  ### Create a new enterprise application in Google

  To create a new enterprise application in Google:

  1. Navigate to the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/) and sign in.
  1. In the navigation sidebar, under **Apps**, select **Web and mobile apps**.
  1. Select the **Add app** button.
  1. From the dropdown, select **Add custom SAML app**.
  1. In the **App details** section, an **App name** is required.
  1. Select the **Continue** button.

  ### Configure your identity provider

  There are two options for configuring your IdP:

  - [**Metadata configuration**](#metadata-configuration) - This is where you can input the URL to your IdP's metadata file. This is the recommended way to configure your IdP.
  - [**Custom configuration**](#custom-configuration) - This is where you can manually input the configuration settings for your IdP.

  #### Metadata configuration

  1. In the Google Admin Console, under **Option 1: Download IdP Metadata**, select the **Download Metadata** button.
  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard and in the **Identity Provider Configuration** section, select the **Upload file** button.
  1. Upload the metadata file you downloaded from Google.

  #### Custom configuration

  If you choose to manually input the configuration settings for your IdP, you must add these three fields to your Clerk settings:

  - **SSO URL** - This is the unique identifier of your IdP application.
  - **Entity ID** - This is your IdP's URL that Clerk will redirect your users to so that they can authenticate.
  - **Certificate** - This is the certificate needed for Clerk to securely connect to your IdP.

  1. In the Google Admin Console, under **Option 2**, copy the **SSO URL**, **Entity ID**, and download the **Certificate**.
  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard and in the **Identity Provider Configuration** section, select **Use manual configuration**.
  1. Fill in the **SSO URL**, **Entity ID**, and upload the **Certificate**. Don't forget to select **Save**.
  1. In the Google Admin Console, select the **Continue** button.

  ### Configure your service provider

  To configure your service provider (Clerk), you will need to add these two fields to your IdP's application:

  - **ACS URL** - This is a unique identifier for your SAML connection that your IdP application needs.
  - **Entity ID** - This is your application's URL that your IdP will redirect your users back to after they have authenticated in your IdP.

  To fill out the appropriate values for these fields:

  1. Navigate to the Clerk Dashboard and find the **Service Provider Configuration** section.
  1. Copy the **ACS URL** and **Entity ID**.
  1. In the Google Admin Console, paste these values into their respective fields.
  1. Under the **Name ID** section, select the dropdown for **Name ID format** and select **Email**.

  ### Map Google claims to Clerk attributes

  Mapping the claims in your IdP to the attributes in Clerk ensures that the data from your IdP is correctly mapped to the data in Clerk.

  | Clerk attribute | Google claim |
  | - | - |
  | `mail` | Basic Information > Primary email |
  | `firstName` | Basic Information > First name |
  | `lastName` | Basic Information > Last name |

  The only Google claim that is necessary to map is the **Primary email**. This is the email address that your users will use to log in to your application.

  1. In the Google Admin Console, under the **Attributes** section, select the dropdown under **Google Directory attributes**.
  1. Select **Primary email**.
  1. Select the dropdown under **App attributes**.
  1. Enter `mail` in the field.
  1. If you have additional claims that you would like to map to Clerk, you can do so by following the steps in the [Map other claims](#map-other-claims-optional) section. Otherwise, select the **Finish** button.

  #### Map other claims (optional)

  In Clerk, the [`User`](/docs/users/overview#user-object) object has a `publicMetadata` property that you can use to store additional information about your users.

  To map other claims from Google that don't have a direct mapping to Clerk attributes, you can map them to the `publicMetadata` property. To do this, prepend the Clerk claims with `public_metadata_` during the mapping process.

  For example, say your users have the "Phone number" attribute in Google. You can map this to your users' public metadata in Clerk by mapping the Google field to `public_metadata_phone_number`.

  1. In the Google Admin Console, under the **Attributes** section, select the dropdown under **Google Directory attributes**.
  1. Select **Phone number**.
  1. Select the empty input under **App attributes**.
  1. Enter `public_metadata_phone_number` in the field.
  1. Select the **Finish** button.

  The value for the user's phone number will be saved in the user's `User.publicMetadata` under the key `phone_number`.

  [Learn more about how to access the metadata from our APIs](/docs/users/metadata).

  ### Enable the connection on Google

  Once the configuration is complete, you will be redirected to the app details page.

  1. In the **User access** section, select **View details**.
  1. In the **Service status** section, select **ON for everyone**.
  1. Select the **Save** button.

  ### Enable the connection for Clerk

  To make the connection available for your users to authenticate with:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, you should still have the connection's configuration page open. If not, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page and select the connection.
  1. Toggle on **Enable connection** and select **Save**.
