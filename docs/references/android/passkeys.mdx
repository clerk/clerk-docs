[Passkeys](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-up-sign-in-options#passkeys) are a secure, passwordless authentication method that use biometrics and a physical device to authenticate users. This guide shows you how to configure passkeys for your Android application.

> [!WARNING]
> Android supports passkeys from version 9+. Passkeys will not work with Android emulators. You must use a physical device.

<Steps>
  ## Enable passkeys

  To use passkeys, first enable the strategy in the Clerk Dashboard.

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Email, Phone, Username**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) page.
  1. Select the **Sign-in options** tab and ensure **Passkeys** is enabled.

  ## Set up your Android app links in the Clerk Dashboard

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Native Applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/native-applications) page.
  1. Select the **Android** tab.
  1. Select **Add Android app**.
  1. Fill out the form with the following information:
     - The `namespace` (This guide uses the default value `android_app`)
     - Your Android app's package name. You can find this in your app-level `build.gradle` file, typically formatted like `com.example.myclerkapp`.
     - The `SHA256 certificate fingerprints`. If you don't know where to find the `SHA256 certificate fingerprints`, see the [Android docs](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth).
  1. After submitting the form, you can verify that your `assetlinks.json` file is properly associated with your app by using [Google's **Statement List Generator and Tester**](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/tools/generator).
</Steps>
