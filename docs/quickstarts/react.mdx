<Steps>

### Set up a React application using Vite

Scaffold your new React application using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm create vite@latest clerk-react -- --template react-ts
  cd clerk-react
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn create vite clerk-react--template react-ts
  cd clerk-react
  yarn install
  yarn dev
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm create vite clerk-react --template react-ts
  cd clerk-react
  pnpm install
  pnpm dev
  ```

</CodeBlockTabs>


### Install `@clerk/clerk-react`

Clerk's React SDK gives you access to prebuilt [components](/docs/components/overview), [hooks](/docs/references/react/use-user), and helpers for React. Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn" ]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/clerk-react
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  pnpm add @clerk/clerk-react
  ```

  ```bash filename="terminal"
  yarn add @clerk/clerk-react
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment keys

In your React project's root folder, you may have an `.env` file alongside `package.json` and other configuration files. If you don't see it, create it.

Add the following code to your `.env.local` file to set your public and secret keys.

**Pro tip!** If you are signed into your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys), you can copy your publishable key below.

<InjectKeys>

```sh filename=".env"
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
```

</InjectKeys>

### Import the Publishable Key

You will need to import your Publishable Key into your application. You can add an `if` statement to check that it is imported and that it exists. This will prevent running the application without the Publishable Key, and will also prevent TypeScript errors.

```tsx filename="src/main.tsx" {6-7, 9-11}
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.tsx'
import './index.css'

// Import your publishable key
const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Missing Publishable Key")
}

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```


### Wrap your app in `<ClerkProvider />`

The [`<ClerkProvider />`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component provides active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components. Import it into your app by adding `import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react'` at the top of your `/src/main.tsx` file. 
```tsx filename="src/main.tsx" {5, 16, 18}
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.tsx'
import './index.css'
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react'

// Import your publishable key
const PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

if (!PUBLISHABLE_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Missing Publishable Key")
}

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ClerkProvider publishableKey={PUBLISHABLE_KEY}>
      <App />
    </ClerkProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

### Use Clerk components to protect your content

You can use Clerk's `<SignedIn />` and `<SignedOut />` components to restrict access to content, or even whole pages. The `<SignedIn />` component requires the user be signed in to view the content inside the tags. The `<SignedOut />` components requires the user to be signed out.

```tsx filename="src/App.tsx" {1, 7-12}
import { SignedOut, SignedIn } from "@clerk/clerk-react"

function App() {

  return (
    <div>
      <SignedOut>
        <p>This content is public. Only signed out users can see this.</p>
      </SignedOut>
      <SignedIn>
        <p>This content is private. Only signed in users can see this.</p>
      </SignedIn>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

At this point, your application should use Clerk's [Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview) pages that are available out of box. Start your React application via `npm run dev`, visit `http://localhost:5173`, and sign up to get access to your application. 

### Embed the `<SignInButton />` and `<SignOutButton />`

Clerk offers a set of [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) to add functionality to your app with minimal effort. The [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-in-button) and [`<SignOutButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-out-button) are *unstyled* components that you can use to either create a basic button or to wrap around your styled button and turn it into a sign-in or sign-out button.

The example below is a page that would show a `<SignInButton />` to users that are signed out, or a `<SignOutButton />` to users that are signed in. You can see that the prop `afterSignOutUrl` is passed to the `<SignOutButton />`. The `afterSignOutUrl` prop lets you customize what page the user will be redirected to after sign out. In this example, the user is redirected to the homepage (`/`) of the application.

```tsx filename="src/App.tsx" {1, 7-14}
import { SignOutButton, SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut } from "@clerk/clerk-react"

function App() {

  return (
    <div>
      <SignedOut>
        <SignInButton />
        <p>This content is public. Only signed out users can see the SignInButton above this text.</p>
      </SignedOut>
      <SignedIn>
        <SignOutButton afterSignOutUrl="/" />
        <p>This content is private. Only signed in users can see the SignOutButton above this text.</p>
      </SignedIn>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

If you copied the example above, you can start your React application via `npm run dev`, visit `http://localhost:5173`, and sign in to see the protected content and the protected `<SignOutButton />`. Select the sign-out button to see the public content and the `<SignInButton />`.

### Deploy your application

You're ready to [deploy your app to production](/docs/deployments/overview) and welcome new users!
</Steps>

## You're authenticated!

Congratulations! Your app is now using Clerk to authenticate users. But this is just the first step. If you would like to clone or investigate this application, please check out:

## Next step: Add routing with React Router

React has many options for handling routing and you are free to choose the option that suits you best. If you would like to learn how to integrate React Router's latest Data API-based router (nicknamed Data Router), please see the [Add React Router to your Clerk Powered application](/docs/references/react/add-react-router) guide.
