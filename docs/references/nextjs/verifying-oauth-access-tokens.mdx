title: Verify OAuth access tokens in your Next.js application with Clerk
description: Learn how to use Clerk's helpers to verify OAuth access tokens in your Next.js application.
---

When building a resource server that needs to accept and verify OAuth access tokens issued by Clerk, it's crucial to verify these tokens on your backend to ensure the request is coming from an authenticated client.

Clerk's Next.js SDK provides a built-in [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) function that supports token validation via the `acceptsToken` parameter. This lets you specify which type(s) of token your API route should accept. You can also use the [`auth.protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#auth-protect) method to check if a request includes a valid machine token (e.g. API key or OAuth token) and enforce access rules accordingly.

By default, `acceptsToken` is set to `session_token`, which means OAuth tokens will **not** be accepted unless explicitly configured. You can pass either a **single token type** or an **array of token types** to `acceptsToken`. To learn more about the supported token types, see the [`auth()` parameters documentation](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#parameters).

Below are two examples of verifying OAuth access tokens in a Next.js API route using Clerk's SDK:

## Example 1: Accepting a single token type

In the following example, the `acceptsToken` parameter is set to only accept `oauth_token`s.

- If the token is invalid or missing, `auth()` will return `null` for `userId` and other properties, and the request will be rejected with a `401` response.
- If the token is valid, `userId` is returned and the token claims are available for use in the application logic.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/api/example/route.ts' }}
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export async function GET(req, res) {
  const { claims, userId } = await auth({ acceptsToken: 'oauth_token' })

  // If auth() returns null, the token is invalid
  if (!userId) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
  }

  return NextResponse.json({ userId, claims })
}
```

## Example 2: Accepting multiple token types

In the following example, the `acceptsToken` option allows both `session_token`s and `oauth_token`s.

- If the token is an `oauth_token`, the code checks that it includes the required `'profile'` scope. If not, an error is thrown.
- If the token is valid and the required scope is present, `userId` is returned and available for use in the application logic. This example includes pseudo-code that uses the `userId` to get data from a database.

{/* TODO: If the token isn't a session or oauth token, should we check if the userId is null and throw a 401? Also, I updated this to destructure the auth return, as that's what is done in the previous example and what is usually done in examples across the docs. */}

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/api/example/route.ts' }}
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export async function POST(req, res) {
  // Accept both session_token and oauth_token types
  const { tokenType, userId, scopes } = await auth({
    acceptsToken: ['session_token', 'oauth_token'],
  })

  // Check if the token is an oauth_token and if it doesn't have the required scope
  if (tokenType === 'oauth_token' && !scopes?.includes('profile')) {
    throw new Error('Unauthorized: OAuth token missing the "profile" scope')
  }

  // If the token includes the required scope, move forward with the application logic
  // This example includes pseudo-code for getting data from a database using the userId
  const data = db.select().from(user).where(eq(user.id, userId))

  return { data }
}
```

You can also protect entire route groups using [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware). See how to implement this in [the middleware docs](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#protect-routes-based-on-token-types).
