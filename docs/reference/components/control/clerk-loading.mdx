The `<ClerkLoading>` renders its children while Clerk is loading, and is helpful for showing a custom loading state.

## Example

It's not recommended to wrap the entire app in the `<ClerkLoading>` component; instead, only wrap the components that need access to the `Clerk` object.

<Include src="_partials/control-components-with-clerkdegraded" />

<If sdk="astro">
  > [!NOTE]
  > Unlike other Clerk components for Astro, `ClerkLoading` must be imported from `@clerk/astro/react`. This requires that your Astro app is set up with React. See [Use Clerk with Astro and React](/docs/reference/astro/react) for guidance.

  ```astro {{ filename: 'index.astro' }}

  import { ClerkLoading, ClerkLoaded } from '@clerk/astro/react'

  <ClerkLoading client:load>
    <p>Clerk is loading</p>
  </ClerkLoading>
  <ClerkLoaded client:load>
    <p>Clerk has loaded</p>
  </ClerkLoaded>
