title: Customize your session token
description: Learn how to customize the session token that is generated for you by Clerk.
---

Session tokens are JWTs generated by Clerk on behalf of your instance, and convey an authenticated user session to your backend.

By default, session tokens contain claims that are required for Clerk to function. You can learn more about these "default claims" in the [session tokens](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens) documentation.

This guide will show you how to customize a session token to include additional claims that you may need in your application.

<Steps>
  ## Add custom claims to your session token

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Sessions**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=sessions) page.
  1. In the **Customize your session token** section, select **Edit**.
  1. In the modal that opens, you can add any claim to your session token that you need.

  The following example adds the `fullName` and `primaryEmail` claims to the session token.

  ## Use the custom claims in your application

  The [`Auth`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object) object includes a `sessionClaims` property that contains the custom claims you added to your session token. It's returned by the [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) and `getAuth()` helpers, and the `request` object in server contexts.

  The following example demonstrates how to access the `fullName` and `primaryEmail` claims that were added to the session token in the last step. This examples are written for Next.js, but they can be adapted to other frameworks by using the appropriate method for accessing the `Auth` object.

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/api/example/route.tsx' }}
    import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
    import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

    export async function GET() {
      const { sessionClaims } = await auth()

      const fullName = sessionClaims?.fullName

      const primaryEmail = sessionClaims?.primaryEmail

      return NextResponse.json({ fullName, primaryEmail })
    }
    ```

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'pages/api/example.ts' }}
    import { getAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'
    import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'

    export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
      const { sessionClaims } = getAuth(req)

      const fullName = sessionClaims.fullName

      const primaryEmail = sessionClaims.primaryEmail

      return res.status(200).json({ fullName, primaryEmail })
    }
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  ## Add global TypeScript type for custom session claims

  To get auto-complete and prevent TypeScript errors when working with custom session claims, you can define a global type.

  1. In your application's root folder, add a `types` directory.
  1. Inside of the `types` directory, add a `globals.d.ts` file.
  1. Create the `CustomJwtSessionClaims` interface and declare it globally.
  1. Add the custom claims to the `CustomJwtSessionClaims` interface.

  The following example demonstrates how to add the `fullName` and `primaryEmail` claims to the `CustomJwtSessionClaims` interface.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'types/globals.d.ts' }}
  export {}

  declare global {
    interface CustomJwtSessionClaims {
      fullName?: string
      primaryEmail?: string
    }
  }
  ```
</Steps>
