# `useSession()`

The `useSession()` hook provides access to the current user's [`Session`](/docs/references/javascript/session) object, as well as helpers for setting the active session.

## `useSession()` returns

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `isLoaded` | `boolean` | A boolean that is set to `false` until Clerk loads and initializes. |
| `isSignedIn` | `boolean` | A boolean that is set to `true` if the user is signed in. |
| `session` | [`Session`](/docs/references/javascript/session) | Holds the current active session for the user. |

## How to use the `useSession()` hook

The following example demonstrates how to use the `useSession()` hook to access the `SignIn` object, which has the `lastActiveAt` property on it. The `lastActiveAt` property is used to display the last active time of the current session to the user.

```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: 'home.tsx' }}
import { useSession } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export default function Home() {
  const { isLoaded, session, isSignedIn } = useSession();

  if (!isLoaded) {
    // Add logic to handle loading state
    return null;
  }
  if(!isSignedIn) {
    // Add logic to handle not signed in state
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>This session has been active
      since {session.lastActiveAt.toLocaleString()}
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```
