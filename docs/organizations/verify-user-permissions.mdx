# Verify the active user's permissions in an organization

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following authorization checks are predicated on a user having an active organization. Without this, they will likely always evaluate to false by default. Learn more about [active organizations](/docs/organizations/overview#active-organization).

In general, you should always verify whether or not a user is authorized to access sensitive information, important content, or exclusive features. The most secure way to implement authorization is by checking the active user's [role or permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#permissions).

Clerk enables two broad approaches to role and permissions-based authorization:

1. If you would like to immediately prevent unauthorized users from accessing content, you can:

- Use the [`<Protect>`](/docs/components/protect) component to prevent content from rendering if the active user is unauthorized.
- Call [`auth().protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) to throw a `404` error if the active user is unauthorized.

2. If you would like more control over the response when a user is unauthorized, you can:

- Call the [`has()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#has) helper, which returns `false` if the active user lacks the role or permissions you're checking for. You can _choose_ how your app responds instead of immediately preventing content from rendering or throwing an error.

## Authorization in Client Components

The examples below work for both SSR and CSR. Examples are written for Next.js App Router but they are supported by any React meta framework, such as Remix or Gatsby.

<Tabs items={["<Protect>", "has()"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example uses Clerk's `<Protect>` component to only render the form for users with the correct permission. The example uses the `fallback` prop to render a different UI if the user is not authorized.

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/form.tsx' }}
      'use client';
      import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

      export function SettingsForm(){
        return (
          <Protect
            permission="org:team_settings:manage"
            fallback={<p>You are not allowed to see this section.</p>}
          >
            <form>
              {/* Add UI for managing team settings */}
            </form>
          </Protect>
        )
      }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    Use the [`useAuth()`](/docs/references/react/use-auth) hook to access the `has()` helper in Client Components.

    The following example uses `has()` to inspect a user's permissions granularly. If the user doesn't have the permission, `has()` returns `false`, causing the component to return `null` instead of rendering its children.

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/form.tsx' }}
      'use client';
      import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

      export function SettingsForm(){
        const { has } = useAuth();

        const canManageSettings = has({ permission: "org:team_settings:manage" });

        if(!canManageSettings) return null;

        return (
          <form>
            {/* Add UI for managing team settings */}
          </form>
        )
      }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authorization in React Server Components

<Tabs items={["<Protect>", "has()", "auth().protect()"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example uses Clerk's `<Protect>` component to only render the form for users with the correct permission. If the user is not authorized, the component will not render its children.

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/layout.tsx' }}
      import type { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
      import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

      export default function SettingsLayout(props: PropsWithChildren){
        return (
          <Protect
            permission="org:team_settings:read"
          >
            {props.children}
          </Protect>
        )
      }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    The following example uses `has()` to inspect a user's permissions granularly. If the user doesn't have the correct permission, `has()` returns `false`, causing the component to return `null` instead of rendering its children.

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/layout.tsx' }}
      import type { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
      import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

      export default function SettingsLayout(props: PropsWithChildren){
        const { has } = auth();

        const canAccessSettings = has({ permission: "org:team_settings:read" });

        if(!canAccessSettings) return null;

        return props.children;
      }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    > [!WARNING]
    > `auth().protect()` only works for App Router and is considered experimental.

    The following example uses [`auth().protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) to protect a RSC from unauthenticated and unauthorized access.

    - If the user is not authenticated, `auth().protect()` will redirect the user to the sign-in route.
    - If the user is authenticated but is not authorized (as in, does not have the `org:team_settings:read` permission), `auth().protect()` will throw a `404` error.
    - If the user is both authenticated and authorized, `auth().protect()` will return the user's `userId`.

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/layout.tsx' }}
    import type { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
    import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

    export default function SettingsLayout(props: PropsWithChildren){
      const { userId } = auth().protect({ permission: "org:team_settings:read" })

      return props.children
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authorization in endpoints

<Tabs items={["Next.js Server Actions", "Next.js Route Handlers", "Next.js Pages Router"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example uses `has()` to inspect a user's permissions granularly in a Next.js Server Action. If the user doesn't have the correct permission, `has()` returns `false`, causing the Server Action to return a `403` error.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/components/ExampleServerComponent.tsx' }}
      import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

      export default function ExampleServerComponent() {
        async function myAction(formData: FormData) {
          'use server'
          const { has } = auth();

          const canManage = has({ permission:"org:team_settings:manage" });

          // If has() returns false, the user does not have the correct permissions
          if(!canManage) return Response.json({ error: "User does not have the correct permissions" }, { status: 403 });

          // Add logic for managing team settings
        }

        return (
          <form action={myAction}>
            {/* Add UI for managing team settings */}
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
          </form>
        );
      }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    <Tabs items={["has()", "auth().protect()"]}>
      <Tab>
        The following example demonstrates how to use `has()` in a Next.js Route Handler.

        The example:

        - uses the `userId` returned from [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth) to check if the user is signed in. If the user is not authenticated, the Route Handler will return a `401` error.
        - uses `has()` to check if the user has the correct permission. If the user is not authorized, `has()` will return false, causing the Route Handler to return a `403` error.

        ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/api/get-teams/route.tsx' }}
          import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

          export const GET = () => {
            const { userId, has } = auth();

            if(!userId){
              return Response.json({ error: "User is not signed in" }, { status: 401 })
            }

            const canRead = has({ permission: "org:team_settings:read" });

            if(!canRead) return Response.json({ error: "User does not have the correct permissions" }, { status: 403 });

            return users.getTeams(userId)
          }
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab>
        > [!WARNING]
        > `auth().protect()` only works for App Router and is considered experimental.

        The following example uses [`auth().protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) to protect a Next.js Route Handler from unauthenticated and unauthorized access.

        - If the user is not authenticated nor authorized (as in, does not have the `org:team_settings:manage` permission), `auth().protect()` will throw a `404` error.
        - If the user is both authenticated and authorized, `auth().protect()` will return the user's `userId`.

        ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/api/create-team/route.tsx' }}
          import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

          export const POST = () => {
            const { userId } = auth().protect({
              permission: "org:team_settings:manage"
            })

            return users.createTeam(userId);
          }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    Use the [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth) helper to access the `has()` helper in a Next.js Pages Router application.

    The following example:

    - uses the `userId` returned from `getAuth()` to check if the user is signed in. If the user is not authenticated, the route will return a `401` error.
    - uses `has()` to check if the user has the correct permission. If the user is not authorized, `has()` will return false, causing the route to return a `403` error.

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'src/pages/api/get-teams.ts' }}
      import { getAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

      export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest) {
        const { userId, has } = await getAuth(req);

        if (!userId) return res.status(401);

        const canRead = has({ permission: "org:team_settings:read" });

        if(!canRead) return res.status(403);

        return users.getTeams(userId);
      }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authorization in Remix Loaders

<CodeBlockTabs type="framework" options={["Remix"]}>
  ```tsx
  export const loader: LoaderFunction = async args => {
    const { has } = await getAuth(args);

    if(has({permission: "org:team_settings:manage"})){
      return redirect('/request-access');
    }
    return {};
  };

  export default function Settings() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Settings Page</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```
</CodeBlockTabs>

## Authorization in JavaScript

If you are not using React or any of the meta-frameworks we support, you can use the Clerk JavaScript SDK. The following example demonstrates how to use the [`checkAuthorization()`](/docs/references/javascript/session#check-authorization) method to check if a user is authorized.

<Tabs items={["JavaScript"]}>
  ```tsx {{ filename: 'main.js' }}
    import { Clerk } from '@clerk/clerk-js';

    // Initialize Clerk with your Clerk publishable key
    const clerk = new Clerk('{{pub_key}}');
    await clerk.load();

    // Check if the user is authenticated
    if (clerk.user) {
      // Check if the user is authorized
      const canManageSettings = clerk.session.checkAuthorization({
        permission: "org:team_settings:manage"
      })
    }
  ```
</Tabs>

## Authorize with roles

> [!WARNING]
> We suggest permission-based authorization over role-based authorization, as it reduces complexity and increases security. Usually, complex role checks can be refactored with a single permission check.

You can pass a `role` the same way you can pass a `permission` in all the examples above.

<Tabs items={[ "RSC with <Protect>", "RSC with auth().protect()", "Client Component with has()", ]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example uses `<Protect>`'s `condition` prop to conditionally render its children if the user has the correct role.

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/layout.tsx' }}
      import type { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
      import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

      export default function SettingsLayout(props: PropsWithChildren){
        return (
          <Protect
            condition={has => has({role: "org:admin"}) || has({role: "org:billing_manager"})}
          >
            {props.children}
          </Protect>
        )
      }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    > [!WARNING]
    > `auth().protect()` only works for App Router and is considered experimental.

    The following example uses [`auth().protect()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth#protect) to protect a RSC from unauthenticated and unauthorized access.

    - If the user is not authenticated, `auth().protect()` will redirect the user to the sign-in route.
    - If the user is authenticated but is not authorized (as in, does not have the `org:admin` or `org:billing_manager` role), `auth().protect()` will throw a `404` error.
    - If the user is both authenticated and authorized, `auth().protect()` will return the user's `userId`.

    ```tsx {{ filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/layout.tsx' }}
      import type { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
      import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

      export default function SettingsLayout(props: PropsWithChildren){
        const { userId } = auth().protect(has => has({ role: "org:admin" }) || has({ role: "org:billing_manager" }))

        return props.children
      }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    Use the [`useAuth()`](/docs/references/react/use-auth) hook to access the `has()` helper in Client Components.

    The following example uses `has()` to inspect a user's roles granularly. If the user doesn't have the correct role, `has()` returns `false`, causing the component to return `null` instead of rendering its children.

    ```tsx filename="/app/dashboard/settings/form.tsx"
      'use client';
      import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

      export function SettingsForm(){
        const { has } = useAuth();

        const canAccessSettings = has({ role: "org:admin" }) || has({ role: "org:billing_manager" })

        if(!canAccessSettings) return null;

        return (
          <form>
            {/* Add UI for team settings */}
          </form>
        )
      }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How to add types for roles and permissions

In order to enhance typesafety in your project, you can define a global `ClerkAuthorization` interface, which defines the acceptable values for roles and permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, roles and permission types, such as `OrganizationCustomRoleKey` and `OrganizationCustomPermissionKey`, are assigned `string`. However, if a `ClerkAuthorization` type is defined, it will be utilized instead.

In the example below, `ClerkAuthorization` is defined with the default roles that Clerk provides.

```tsx filename="types/globals.d.ts"
export { };

declare global {
  interface ClerkAuthorization {
    permission: '';
    role: 'org:admin' | 'org:member';
  }
}
```

Because Clerk supports custom roles and permissions, you can modify `ClerkAuthorization` to align with the roles and permissions configured in your Clerk application. See how in the example below, the default Clerk roles `org:admin` and `org:member` are replaced with custom roles `org:super_admin`, `org:teacher`, and `org:student`.

```tsx filename="types/globals.d.ts"
export { };

declare global {
  interface ClerkAuthorization {
    permission: 'org:quiz:create' | 'org:quiz:grade' | 'org:quiz:read' | 'org:quiz:fill';
    role: 'org:super_admin' | 'org:teacher' | 'org:student';
  }
}
```
