# `updateEmailAddress()`

Updates an [`EmailAddress`](/docs/references/javascript/email-address).

```tsx
function updateEmailAddress: (emailAddressId: string, params: UpdateEmailAddressParams) => Promise<EmailAddress>;
```

## `UpdateEmailAddressParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `primary?` | `boolean` | Whether or not to set the email address as the user's primary email address. |
| `verified?` | `boolean` | Whether or not the email address is verified. |

## Example

Let's start with an `EmailAddress` object that looks like this:

```js
_EmailAddress {
  id: 'idn_123',
  emailAddress: 'testclerk123@gmail.com',
  verification: _Verification {
    status: 'verified',
    strategy: 'from_oauth_google',
    externalVerificationRedirectURL: null,
    attempts: null,
    expireAt: null,
    nonce: null
  },
  linkedTo: [
    _IdentificationLink {
      id: 'idn_123',
      type: 'oauth_google'
    }
  ]
}
```

Let's update the email address to be unverified:

```tsx {12-13}
const emailAddressId = 'idn_123';

const params = { verified: false };

const response = await clerkClient.emailAddresses.updateEmailAddress(emailAddressId, params);

console.log(response);
/*
_EmailAddress {
  id: 'idn_123',
  emailAddress: 'testclerk123@gmail.com',
  verification: null,
  linkedTo: []
}
*/
```

As you can see in the response, the email address is now unverified.

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `PATCH/email_addresses/{email_address_id}`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Email-Addresses#operation/UpdateEmailAddress) for more details.
