Clerk provides a set of [hooks and helpers](/docs/references/react-router/overview#client-side-helpers) that you can use to access the active session and user data in your React Router application. Here are examples of how to use these helpers in both the client and server-side to get you started.

## Server-side

To access active session and user data on the server-side, use the [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/react-router/get-auth) helper.

## Client-side

To access active session and user data on the client-side, use the `useAuth()` and `useUser()` hooks.

### `useAuth()`

<Include src="_partials/hooks/use-auth" />

### `useUser()`

<Include src="_partials/hooks/use-user" />
