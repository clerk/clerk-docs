How to set up social connection with Twitter v2

## Overview

Adding social connection with X/Twitter to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized Redirect URI** in your instance settings.

Clerk does not currently support preconfigured shared OAuth credentials for X/Twitter on development instances. You will have to provide custom credentials for both development *and* production instances, which includes generating your own Client ID and Client Secret using your Twitter Developer account. Don't worry, this guide will walk you through that process in just a few simple steps.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a X/Twitter account and a X/Twitter OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

<Callout type="warning">
  X/Twitter v2 is currently not providing email addresses of users. User will have to fill in their email address manually, when they return to your application after authenticating with X/Twitter.

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a X/Twitter Application set up so it can be used for Social connection. If you don't have a X/Twitter Application, click [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/apps/overview) for instructions on how to create one.

## Configuring X/Twitter social connection

If you don't have an existing Twitter Application you've set up for social connection, you need to register a new one at the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). Note that the process requires approval from Twitter before your new application can be used.

To do so, go to "[Projects & Apps](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps)" and click "**+ Add App**" to create a new application. After entering a name, you'll be presented with your app's credentials. However, for setting up the X/Twitter v2 social connection with Clerk, you won't need these credentials. This is because we'll be utilizing the OAuth 2.0 flow, which relies on different authentication details.

In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **User & Authentication > [Social Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/social-connections)** and enable **X/Twitter v2** (not Twitter v1). In the modal that opened, copy the **Redirect URIs**.

Navigate to your application settings screen and scroll down to the **User authentication settings** section and click **Set up**.

In the next screen you'll be presented with the user authentication settings. Select **Web App, Automated App or Bot** under **Type of App**.

Also, enter the **Redirect URI** that you grabbed in the previous step from your Clerk instance's settings and insert it in the **Callback URI** setting. Your app's settings should like similar to the ones below. Fill any other required fields and click save.

Click **Save** and now you should be able to see your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy those values and paste them in your Clerk instance's settings and click **Save**.

Congratulations! Social connection with X/Twitter is now configured for your instance.
