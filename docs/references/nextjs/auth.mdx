title: '`auth()`'
description: Access minimal authentication data for managing sessions and data fetching.

The `auth()` helper returns the [`Auth`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object) object of the currently active user, as well as the [`redirectToSignIn()`](#redirect-to-sign-in) method.

- Only available for App Router.
- Only works on the server-side, such as in Server Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions.
- Requires [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware) to be configured.

## `auth.protect()`

`auth` includes a single property, the `protect()` method, which you can use in two ways:

- to check if a user is authenticated (signed in)
- to check if a user is authorized (has the correct roles or permissions) to access something, such as a component or a route handler

The following table describes how `auth.protect()` behaves based on user authentication or authorization status:

| Authenticated | Authorized | `auth.protect()` will |
| - | - | - |
| Yes | Yes | Return the [`Auth`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object) object. |
| Yes | No | Return a `404` error. |
| No | No | Redirect the user to the sign-in page\*. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> \*For non-document requests, such as API requests, `auth.protect()` returns a `404` error to users who aren't authenticated.

`auth.protect()` accepts the following parameters:

<Properties>
  - `role?`
  - `string`

  The role to check for.

  ---

  - `permission?`
  - `string`

  The permission to check for.

  ---

  - `has?`
  - `(isAuthorizedParams: CheckAuthorizationParamsWithCustomPermissions) => boolean`

  A function that returns a boolean based on the permission or role provided as parameter. Can be used for authorization. See [the dedicated `has()` section](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#has) for more information.

  ---

  - `unauthorizedUrl?`
  - `string`

  The URL to redirect the user to if they are not authorized.

  ---

  - `unauthenticatedUrl?`
  - `string`

  The URL to redirect the user to if they are not authenticated.
</Properties>

### Examples

`auth.protect()` can be used to check if a user is authenticated or authorized to access certain parts of your application or even entire routes. See detailed examples in [the dedicated guide.](/docs/organizations/verify-user-permissions)

## `redirectToSignIn()`

The `auth()` helper returns the `redirectToSignIn()` method, which you can use to redirect the user to the sign-in page.

`redirectToSignIn()` accepts the following parameters:

<Properties>
  - `returnBackUrl?`
  - `string | URL`

  The URL to redirect the user back to after they sign in.
</Properties>

> [!NOTE]
> `auth()` on the server-side can only access redirect URLs defined via [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects) or [`clerkMiddleware` dynamic keys](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware#dynamic-keys).

### Example

The following example shows how to use `redirectToSignIn()` to redirect the user to the sign-in page if they are not authenticated. It's also common to use `redirectToSignIn()` in `clerkMiddleware()` to protect entire routes; see [the `clerkMiddleware()` docs](/docs/references/nextjs/clerk-middleware) for more information.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default async function Page() {
  const { userId, redirectToSignIn } = await auth()

  if (!userId) return redirectToSignIn()

  return <h1>Hello, {userId}</h1>
}
```

## Use `auth()` to retrieve `userId`

You can use `auth()` to check if a `userId` exists. If it does not, that means there is no user signed in. You can use this information to protect pages, as shown in the following example:

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/page.tsx' }}
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export default async function Page() {
  const { userId }: { userId: string | null } = await auth()

  if (!userId) return null

  return <h1>Hello, {userId}</h1>
}
```

## Use `auth()` for data fetching

When using a Clerk integration, or if you need to send a JWT along to a server, you can use the `getToken()` function that is returned by `auth()`.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/api/example/route.ts' }}
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export async function GET() {
  const { userId, getToken } = await auth()

  if (!userId) {
    return new Response('User is not signed in.', { status: 401 })
  }

  try {
    const token = await getToken({ template: 'supabase' })

    // Add logic here to fetch data from Supabase and return it.

    const data = { supabaseData: 'Hello World' }

    return Response.json({ data })
  } catch (error) {
    return Response.json(error)
  }
}
```

## Use `auth()` to protect your app

You can protect certain parts of your application or even entire routes based on a user's authentication and/or authorization status. See detailed examples in [the dedicated guide.](/docs/organizations/verify-user-permissions)
