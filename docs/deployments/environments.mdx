description: An overview of the differences between development and production instances.
---

When creating a new application within Clerk, you are provided with two instances: `Development` and `Production`.  These instances vary slightly and should only be used appropriately.

## Development instance

A `Development` instance is Clerk's default instance type and has characteristics that allow it to be more useful for local development. To facilitate development and local authentication, `Development` instances have a more relaxed security posture and are not suitable for production workloads.

Some notable examples of `Development`-only characteristics in a Clerk application are:

- A `Development` banner is shown prominently in the Clerk Dashboard to make clear you're managing or configuring non-production data
- Email and SMS templates are prefixed with the environment type to prevent against using `Development` instances for production purposes
- Some social connections use shared credentials by default
- [The Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview) will use a Clerk development domain that ends with `accounts.dev` instead of your app's production domain
- OAuth consent screens will show the development domain that ends with `accounts.dev` instead of your production domain
- Search engines will not be able to crawl and index your application
- Development instances have a 100 users cap and user data can not be transferred between instances
- The architecture of Clerk's sessions management is different in development instances compared to production instances, due to the need to communicate cross-domain between `localhost` and `<slug>.accounts.dev`, which is not the case in production instances where CNAME records are used to alias Clerk's Frontend API (FAPI) to a subdomain of your application (e.g., `clerk.example.com`). For more specific details on the differences between Clerk's session management architecture in development and production instances, see the [technical breakdown below](#session-management-architecture-differences-between-clerk-environments).

> [!NOTE]
> All paid functionality is available in a `Development` instance. However, when you deploy your application to `Production`, you will be asked to upgrade to a `Pro` account. See [our pricing page](/pricing) for full details.

## Production instance

A `Production` instance is the more robust option of Clerk's instance types. `Production` instances are meant to support high volumes of traffic and by default, have a more strict security posture.

Some notable differences between `Production` and `Development` instances in a Clerk application are:

- You must associate a production domain within the Clerk Dashboard
- You are required to provision your own SSO credentials

When deploying to production, you must first activate your `Production` environment. See the [Deploying to Production](/docs/deployments/overview) guide to learn about the process and avoid common pitfalls.

## Staging environments

Clerk does not currently support staging instances in Clerk applications. However, you can set up a "staging environment" by creating a separate Clerk application with a separate domain. For more information, see the [staging guide](/docs/deployments/set-up-staging).

## Preview environments

See [the preview environment guide](/docs/deployments/set-up-preview-environment) to learn how to use Clerk with your preview deployments.

## Session management architecture differences between Clerk environments

> ![NOTE]
> In order to understand this section, it's recommended to have a solid understanding of how Clerk's session management architecture works. For more information, check out out guide on [how Clerk works](/docs/how-clerk-works/overview).

In production instances, Clerk uses a [client token](/docs/how-clerk-works/overview#client-token) to represent the user's session state. The client token is stored in an `HttpOnly` cookie on the [FAPI](https://clerk.com/docs/how-clerk-works/overview#the-frontend-api) domain, such that when your app's frontend makes a request to FAPI, the client token is sent along with the request. This works cleanly as FAPI is hosted on the same domain as your app's frontend due to the use of a CNAME record to alias Clerk's FAPI to a subdomain of your application (e.g., `clerk.example.com`).

However, in development environments, requests from your app's frontend to FAPI are cross-domain, as the development environment is typically accessed through a localhost domain, and FAPI for development instances is hosted on a domain that ends with `accounts.dev`. This means that the client token cannot be securely and reliably stored and transmitted in a cookie.

> Let's think through how we could make it work. In order for cookies to be sent cross-site, the cookie would need to be set with [SameSite=None](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#none). Unfortunately for this use case, modern browsers are increasingly restrictive on cross-site cookie behavior due to the abuse of cookies for tracking and advertising, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to set cookies with `SameSite=None`. Safari specifically [does not support `SameSite=None` for cookies at all](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/browse-the-web-privately-iphb01fc3c85/ios) unless a browser flag is enabled. Other browsers also have restrictions around cross-site cookie behavior, which leads to a frustrating and unreliable experience for local development.

As such, development instances use a different approach to maintain session state. A object called the "dev browser", which is linked directly to the client object for Clerk's internals, is used to maintain session state across the session lifetime, and transmitted via querystring (`__clerk_db_jwt`) rather than via cookie. This strategy allows for a more reliable experience for local development. However, it is not secure enough for production use. Including a sensitive value like the client token in a querystring is not a good practice, since it can be seen directly in server logs, browser history, internet providers' logs, and could be potentially intercepted by third-parties via malicious browsers or network interceptors. As such, the `__clerk_db_jwt` object is **not used in production instances**.

If you are relying on the `__clerk_db_jwt` object anywhere in your application code, your code will break in production. Clerk strongly recommends not relying on the `__clerk_db_jwt` object anywhere in your application code.
