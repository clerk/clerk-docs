title: Clerk MCP server
description: Connect AI coding assistants to Clerk's MCP server to get SDK snippets and patterns.
---

Clerk provides a remote [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that allows AI coding assistants like Claude, Cursor, and VS Code Copilot to access Clerk SDK snippets and implementation patterns. This helps AI assistants provide accurate, up-to-date code examples when building authentication features with Clerk.

The Clerk MCP server provides:

- **SDK snippets**: Ready-to-use code patterns for common Clerk features
- **Implementation guides**: Best practices for authentication flows, organizations, and more
- **Framework-specific examples**: Patterns optimized for Next.js, React, and other supported frameworks

## Setup instructions

Clerk's MCP server is centrally hosted and requires no authentication. The server uses the Streamable HTTP transport.

- **URL**: `https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp`

### Cursor

To add the MCP server to Cursor, you can install by clicking [here](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Clerk&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5jbGVyay5jb20vbWNwIn0=), or searching for Clerk from Cursor's [MCP tools page](https://cursor.directory).

Alternatively, you can manually configure it:

1. Navigate to **Cursor Settings**. To find this, open the **Command Palette** (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`) and search for **Cursor Settings**, or select the gear icon in the top right corner of the app.
1. In the sidenav, select **Tools & Integrations**.
1. Click the **New MCP Server** button to open the MCP configuration JSON file.
1. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clerk": {
      "url": "https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

5. Once added, you should see a green active status.

      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex

**Configuration via CLI:**

Run the following command in Terminal:

```bash
codex mcp add clerk --transport http https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp
```

> [!NOTE]
> If this is the first time you are using an MCP in Codex, you will need to enable the `rmcp` feature. Add the following into your `~/.codex/config.toml`:
>
> ```toml
> [beta]
> rmcp = true
> ```

**Configuration through config file:**

1. Open the `~/.codex/config.toml` file in your preferred editor.
1. Add the following:

```toml
[mcp_servers.clerk]
type = "url"
url = "https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp"
```

### Other clients

Many other tools now support MCP servers. You can configure them to use Clerk's MCP server with the following settings:

- **Command**: `npx`
- **Arguments**: `-y mcp-remote https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp`
- **Environment**: None

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Why am I seeing an internal server error when trying to connect?">
  This typically occurs when there's a network issue. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the MCP server. Ensure your client supports Streamable HTTP transport.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does the MCP server support SSE (Server-Sent Events)?">
  No, the Clerk MCP server only supports Streamable HTTP transport at `https://mcp.clerk.com/mcp`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use this with my own Clerk application?">
  The Clerk MCP server provides SDK snippets and patterns that work with any Clerk application. It does not access your specific Clerk instance data - it provides general implementation guidance and code examples.
