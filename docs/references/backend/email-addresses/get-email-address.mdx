const response = await clerkClient.emailAddresses.getEmailAddress(emailAddressId);

console.log(response);

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/email_addresses/{email_address_id}`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Email-Addresses#operation/GetEmailAddress) for more details.
