description: Learn how to integrate Clerk into your React application using the Clerk React SDK.
---

The Clerk React SDK is built on top of the [JavaScript SDK](/docs/references/javascript/overview) and is the recommended method for integrating Clerk into your React application.

## Custom hooks

The React SDK provides hooks that give you access to the [`Clerk` object](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk), [`User` object](/docs/references/javascript/user/user), and helper methods for authentication flows.

## Framework-specific SDKs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Clerk provides optimized SDKs for specific React frameworks. If you're using one of the supported frameworks below, you should use its dedicated SDK instead of `@clerk/clerk-react`.
>
> For example, Next.js applications **must** use `@clerk/nextjs` as `@clerk/clerk-react` is not compatible.

Clerk offers framework-specific SDKs that are customized to provide the better developer experience and integration with each framework's features. Choose the appropriate SDK based on your framework:

| Framework | Package | Docs |
| - | - | - |
| Next.js | `@clerk/nextjs` | [Next.js SDK](/docs/sdk/nextjs/methods) |
| React Router | `@clerk/clerk-react-router` | [React Router SDK](/docs/sdk/react-router/methods) |
| Remix | `@clerk/remix` | [Remix SDK](/docs/sdk/remix/clerk-app) |
| Astro | `@clerk/astro` | [Astro SDK](/docs/sdk/astro/methods) |
| Tanstack Start | `@clerk/tanstack-start` | [Tanstack Start SDK](/docs/sdk/tanstack-start/methods) |

## Set up Clerk React

Before you can add Clerk to your React application, you must create a Clerk app in the Clerk Dashboard. To get started, follow the [setup guide](/docs/getting-started). Then, follow the [quickstart guide](/docs/sdk/react/quickstart) to set up the React SDK in your app.
