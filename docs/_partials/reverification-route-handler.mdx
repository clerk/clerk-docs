The following example uses the [`has()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-object#has) helper to check if the user has verified their credentials within a specific time period. The `strict` configuration sets the time period to 10 minutes. If the user hasn't verified their credentials within 10 minutes, the `reverificationErrorResponse` utility is used to return an error.

```tsx {{ filename: 'app/api/reverification-example/route.ts' }}
import { auth, reverificationErrorResponse } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

export const POST = async (req: Request) => {
  const { has } = await auth()

  // Check if the user has *not* verified their credentials within the past 10 minutes.
  const shouldUserRevalidate = !has({ reverification: 'strict' })

  // If the user hasn't reverified, return an error with the matching configuration (e.g., `strict`)
  if (shouldUserRevalidate) {
    return reverificationErrorResponse('strict')
  }

  // If the user has verified credentials, return a successful response
  return new Response({ success: true })
}
```
