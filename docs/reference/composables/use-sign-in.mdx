title: useSignIn() | Vue
description: Access and manage sign-in state in your Vue application with Clerk's useSignIn() composable.
sdk: vue, nuxt
---

The `useSignIn()` composable provides access to the [`SignIn`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-in) object, which allows you to check the current state of a sign-in attempt and manage the sign-in flow. You can use this to create a [custom sign-in flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview#sign-in-flow).

## Returns

<Properties>
  - `isLoaded`
  - `Ref<boolean>`

  A boolean that indicates whether Clerk has completed initialization. Initially `false`, becomes `true` once Clerk loads.

  ---

  - `setActive()`
  - <code>Ref\<(params: [SetActiveParams](/docs/reference/javascript/types/set-active-params)) => Promise\<void>></code>

  A function that sets the active session.

  ---

  - `signIn`
  - <code>Ref\<[SignIn](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-in)></code>

  An object that contains the current sign-in attempt status and methods to create a new sign-in attempt.
</Properties>

## How to use the `useSignIn()` composable

The following example uses `useSignIn()` to access the [`SignIn`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-in) object, which contains the current sign-in attempt status and methods to create a new sign-in attempt. The `isLoaded` property is used to handle the loading state.

```vue {{ filename: 'SignInPage.vue' }}
<script setup>
import { useSignIn } from '@clerk/vue'

const { isLoaded, signIn } = useSignIn()
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="!isLoaded">
    <!-- Add logic to handle loading state -->
  </div>

  <div v-else>The current sign in attempt status is {{ signIn?.status }}.</div>
</template>
```
