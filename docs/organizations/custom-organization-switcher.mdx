title: Create a custom organization switcher
description: Learn how to build a custom organization switcher using the useOrganizationList() hook.
---

If you need more control than what Clerk's prebuilt [`<OrganizationSwitcher />`](/docs/components/organization/organization-switcher) component provides, you can build your own organization switcher using the [`useOrganizationList()`](/docs/references/react/use-organization-list) hook.

In the following example, the `useOrganizationList()` hook is used to fetch `userMemberships`, which contains a `data` array of the user's organizations. The `data` array is paginated and will only return the first 10 results, so the `fetchNext()` method is used to load more organizations if they are available. For more information about the properties and methods available on the `userMemberships` object, visit the [`useOrganizationList()` reference page](https://clerk.com/docs/references/react/use-organization-list#paginated-resources).

The example is written for Next.js App Router, but it is supported by any React meta framework, such as Remix or Gatsby.

To get started, create a new file called `OrganizationSwitcher.tsx` and paste the following code into it. You can place this file anywhere in your project, but in this example, it is placed in a folder called `components`.

```tsx filename="app/components/OrganizationSwitcher.tsx"
"use client"

import { useOrganizationList } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export const CustomOrganizationSwitcher = () => {
  const { isLoaded, setActive, userMemberships } = useOrganizationList({
    userMemberships: {
      infinite: true,
    },
  });

  if (!isLoaded) {
    return <p>Loading</p>;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Custom Organization Switcher</h2>
      <ul>
        {userMemberships.data?.map((mem) => (
          <li key={mem.id}>
            <span>{mem.organization.name}</span>
            <button
              onClick={() => setActive({ organization: mem.organization.id })}
            >
              Select
            </button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <button
        disabled={!userMemberships.hasNextPage}
        onClick={() => userMemberships.fetchNext()}
      >
        Load more organizations
      </button>
    </>
  );
};
```
