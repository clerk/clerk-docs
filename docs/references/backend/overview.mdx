# Clerk Backend SDK

The [Clerk Backend SDK](https://github.com/clerk/javascript/tree/main/packages/backend) exposes Clerk's backend API resources and low-level authentication utilities for JavaScript environments. While the backend SDK is mainly used as a building block for Clerk's higher-level SDKs, it can also be used on its own for advanced flows and custom integrations.

Clerk SDKs expose an instance of the Clerk Backend SDK for use in server environments.

<Tabs type="framework" items={["Next.js", "Remix", "Fastify", "Node"]}>
  <Tab>
  The Backend SDK is accessible via the `clerkClient` object if you are using Next.js.

  ```jsx
  import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/nextjs/server';
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
  The Backend SDK is accessible via the `createClerkClient` function if you are using Remix.

  ```jsx
  import { createClerkClient } from '@clerk/remix/api.server';
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
  The Backend SDK is accessible via the `clerkClient` object if you are using Fastify.

  ```jsx
  import { clerkClient } from "@clerk/fastify";
  ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
  The Backend SDK is accessible via the `clerkClient` object if you are using Node.

  ```js
  import { clerkClient } from '@clerk/clerk-sdk-node';
  ```
  </Tab>

## Error handling

Backend SDK functions do not throw errors when something goes wrong. Instead, they return a [`ClerkBackendApiResponse`](/docs/references/javascript/types/clerk-backend-api-response) object, just as they would if there were no errors. You can check for errors on the `.errors` property of the response. For example:

```ts filename="example.ts"
const { data, errors } = someBackendApiCall();
```

This approach to error handling allows Clerk to produce strongly-typed errors for those using TypeScript, and can reduce the need for `try/catch` blocks in your code.
