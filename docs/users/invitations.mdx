Inviting users to your Clerk application allows you to onboard new users seamlessly by sending them a unique invitation link.

Once you create an invitation, Clerk sends an email to the invited user with a unique invitation link. When the user visits the invitation link, they will be redirected to the [Account Portal sign-up page](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview#sign-up) and **their email address will be automatically verified.** If you want to redirect the user to a specific page in your application, you can [specify a redirect URL when creating the invitation.](#redirect-url)

Invitations expire after a month. If the user clicks on an expired invitation, they will get redirected to the application's sign-up page and will have to go through the normal sign-up flow. Their email address will not be auto-verified.

> [!TIP]
> Invitations are only used to invite users to your application. The application will still be available to everyone even without an invitation. If you're looking to restrict access to invited users only, please refer to the [**Restricted** sign-up mode](/docs/authentication/configuration/restrictions#sign-up-modes).

## Create an invitation

You can create an invitation in the [Clerk Dashboard](#using-clerk-dashboard) or [using the Backend API](#using-backend-api).

### Using Clerk Dashboard

To invite users, navigate to the **Users** page from the top-level menu, then select the **Invitations** tab. Select **Invite user** and enter the email address of the person you want to invite. Optionally, set an expiration date for the invitation. Once you've entered the necessary details, click **Send invite** to send the invitation email.

> [!TIP]
> The same page will be available throught the top-level menu, when you are in the **Restricted** sign-up mode.

### Using Backend API

You can either use a cURL command or the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) to create an invitation. Clerk's JavaScript Backend SDK is a wrapper around the Backend API that makes it easier to interact with the API. Use the following tabs to see examples for each method.

<Tabs items={["cURL", "Backend SDK"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example demonstrates how to create an invitation using cURL.

    <SignedIn>
      Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite. Your Clerk secret key is already injected into the code snippet.
    </SignedIn>

    <SignedOut>
      Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite and replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your Clerk secret key. You can find your secret key in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    </SignedOut>

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    curl https://api.clerk.com/v1/invitations -X POST -d '{"email_address": "email@example.com"}' -H "Authorization:Bearer {{secret}}" -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    To use the Backend SDK to create an invitation, see the [`createInvitation()` reference.](/docs/references/backend/invitations/create-invitation)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Check out [the Backend API reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Invitations#operation/CreateInvitation) to see an example of the response.

### Redirect URL

When you create an invitation, you can specify a `redirect_url` parameter. This parameter tells Clerk where to redirect the user when they visit the invitation link.

The following example demonstrates how to use cURL to create an invitation with the `redirect_url` set to `https://www.example.com/accept-invitation`:

```bash
curl https://api.clerk.com/v1/invitations -X POST -d '{"email_address": "email@example.com", "redirect_url": "https://www.example.com/accept-invitation"}' -H "Authorization:Bearer {{secret}}" -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
```

Once the user visits the invitation link, they will be redirected to the page you specified, which means you must handle the sign-up flow in your code for that page. You can either embed the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component on that page, or if the prebuilt component doesn't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can build a [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/invitations).

> [!TIP]
> For testing redirect URL's in your development environment, you can pass your port (`http://localhost:3000`). If you would like to use the Account Portal, you can pass your Clerk Frontend API URL as the base URL. For example, `https://prepared-phoenix-98.clerk.accounts.dev/sign-up` would send the user to the Account Portal sign-up page. You can find your Frontend API URL in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page. On the left side, select **Show API URLs**.

### Invitation metadata

You can also add metadata to an invitation. Once the invited user signs up using the invitation link, the invitation metadata will end up in the user's `public_metadata`. You can find more information about user metadata in the [metadata](/docs/users/metadata) docs.

To add metadata to an invitation, you can use the `public_metadata` property when the invitation is created.

The following example demonstrates how to create an invitation with metadata using cURL.

<SignedIn>
  Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite, and the `public_metadata` with the metadata you want to add. Your secret key is already injected into the code snippet.
</SignedIn>

<SignedOut>
  Replace the email address with the email address you want to invite, and the `public_metadata` with the metadata you want to add. Replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your Clerk secret key. You can find your secret key in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
</SignedOut>

```bash
curl https://api.clerk.com/v1/invitations -X POST -d '{"email_address": "email@example.com", "public_metadata": {"age": "21"}}' -H "Authorization:Bearer {{secret}}" -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
```

## Revoking invitations

You can revoke an invitation at any time. Revoking an invitation prevents the user from using the invitation link that was sent to them.

### Using Clerk Dashboard

To revoke an invitation, navigate to the **Users** page from the top-level menu, then select the **Invitations** tab. Find the invitation you want to revoke and select **Revoke** from the dropdown menu on the right.

> [!TIP]
> The same page will be available throught the top-level menu, when you are in the **Restricted** sign-up mode.

### Using Backend API

You can either use a cURL command or the [JavaScript Backend SDK](/docs/references/backend/overview) to create an invitation. Use the following tabs to see examples for each method.

<Tabs items={["cURL", "Backend SDK"]}>
  <Tab>
    The following example demonstrates how to revoke an invitation using cURL.

    <SignedIn>
      Replace the `<invitation_id>` with the ID of the invitation you want to revoke. Your secret key is already injected into the code snippet.
    </SignedIn>

    <SignedOut>
      Replace the `<invitation_id>` with the ID of the invitation you want to revoke and replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your Clerk secret key. You can find your secret key in the Clerk Dashboard on the [API Keys](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys) page.
    </SignedOut>

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    curl https://api.clerk.com/v1/invitations/<invitation_id>/revoke -X POST -H "Authorization:Bearer {{secret}}" -H 'Content-Type:application/json'
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    To use the Backend SDK to revoke an invitation, see the [`revokeInvitation()`](/docs/references/backend/invitations/revoke-invitation) reference documentation.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Check out [the Backend API reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Invitations#operation/RevokeInvitation) to see an example of the response.

> [!WARNING]
> Revoking an invitation does **not** prevent the user from signing up on their own. If you're looking to restrict access to invited users only, please refer to the [**Restricted** sign-up mode](/docs/authentication/configuration/restrictions#sign-up-modes).

## Custom flow

Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) and [Account Portal pages](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview) handle the sign-up flow for you, including the invitation flow. If you want to build a **custom** sign-up flow, see the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/invitations) guide.
