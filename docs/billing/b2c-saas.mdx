Clerk billing for B2C SaaS allows you to create plans and manage subscriptions **for individual users** in your application. If you'd like to charge companies or organizations, see [Billing for B2B SaaS](/docs/billing/b2b-saas). You can also combine both B2C and B2B billing in the same application.

## Create a plan

Subscription plans are what your users subscribe to. There is no limit to the number of plans you can create.

To create a plan, navigate to the [**Plans**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/plans) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Here, you can create, edit, and delete plans. To setup B2C billing, select the **Plans for Users** tab and select **Add Plan**. When creating a plan, you can also create features for the plan; see the next section for more information.

> Plans appear in some Clerk components depending on what kind of plan it is. All plans can appear in the `<PricingTable />` component. If it's a user plan, it can appear in the `<UserProfile />` component. When creating or editing a plan, if you'd like to hide it from appearing in Clerk components, you can toggle the **Publicly available** option off.

## Add features to a plan

Features make it easy to give entitlements to your plans. You can add any number of features to a plan.

You can add a feature to a plan when you are creating a plan. To add it after a plan is created:

1. Navigate to the [**Plans**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=billing/plans) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
1. Select the plan you'd like to add a feature to.
1. In the **Features** section, select **Add Feature**.

If it's a user plan, it can appear in the `<UserProfile />` component. When adding a feature to a plan, it will also automatically appear in the corresponding plan. When creating or editing a feature, if you'd like to hide it from appearing in Clerk components, you can toggle the **Publicly available** option off.

## Create a pricing page

You can create a pricing page by using the [`<PricingTable />`](/docs/components/pricing-table) component. This component displays a table of plans and features that users can subscribe to. **It's recommended to create a dedicated page**, as shown in the following example.

<Include src="_partials/billing/create-a-pricing-table" />

## Control access with features and plans

You can use Clerk's features and plans to gate access to the content. There are a few ways to do this, but the recommended approach is to either use the [`has()`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#has) method or the [`<Protect>`](/docs/components/protect) component.

The `has()` method is available for any JavaScript framework, while `<Protect>` is only available for React-based frameworks.

### Example: Using `has()`

Use the `has()` method to test if the user has access to a **plan**:

```jsx
const hasPremiumAccess = has({ plan: 'gold' })
```

Or a **feature**:

```jsx
const hasPremiumAccess = has({ feature: 'widgets' })
```

The [`has()`](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object#has) method checks if the user has been granted a specific type of access control (role, permission, feature, or plan) and returns a boolean value. It is available on the [`auth` object](/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object) on the server. Depending on the framework you are using, you will access the `auth` object differently.

### Example: Using `<Protect>`

The [`<Protect>`](/docs/components/protect) component protects content or even entire routes by checking if the user has been granted a specific type of access control (role, permission, feature, or plan). You can pass a `fallback` prop to `<Protect>` that will be rendered if the user does not have the access control.
