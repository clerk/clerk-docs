description: The clerkMiddleware() helper allows you to protect your Nuxt application using middleware.
sdk: nuxt
---

The `clerkMiddleware()` helper allows you to protect your Nuxt application **on the server-side**. It can be used to validate a user's authentication status or authorization status.

> [!WARNING]
> `clerkMiddleware()` should be used to protect API routes only. It's not recommended to use `clerkMiddleware()` to protect pages as it will **only work on initial page reload**. On subsequent navigations, it won't be triggered because client-side navigation will bypass the middleware. To protect pages, see the [dedicated guide](/docs/guides/secure/protect-pages).

## Configure `clerkMiddleware()`

By default, the Nuxt SDK **automatically** adds the `clerkMiddleware()` helper to your Nuxt application.

To **manually** configure the middleware:

1. In your `nuxt.config.ts` file, under the `clerk` property, set `skipServerMiddleware: true`.

   ```ts {{ filename: 'nuxt.config.ts', mark: [[3, 5]] }}
   export default defineNuxtConfig({
     modules: ['@clerk/nuxt'],
     clerk: {
       skipServerMiddleware: true,
     },
   })
   ```
1. In your `server/middleware/` directory, create a file named `clerk.ts` with the following code:

   ```ts {{ filename: 'server/middleware/clerk.ts' }}
   import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'
   export default clerkMiddleware()
   ```

## Protect API routes

You can protect API routes using either or both of the following:

- [Authentication-based protection](#authentication-based-protection): Verify if the user is signed in.
- [Authorization-based protection](#authorization-based-protection): Verify if the user has the required privileges, such as a Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan. Learn more about [authorization checks](/docs/guides/secure/authorization-checks).

You can also [protect multiple routes](#protect-multiple-routes) using the `createRouteMatcher()` helper.

### Authentication-based protection

To protect routes based on user authentication status, you can check if the user is signed in by checking the `isAuthenticated` property on the [`auth`](/docs/reference/nuxt/overview#auth-object) object.

In the following example, the `clerkMiddleware()` helper checks if the user is signed in and accessing a protected route. If they aren't signed in, an error is thrown using Nuxt's [`createError()`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/create-error) utility.

```tsx {{ filename: 'server/middleware/clerk.ts' }}
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

export default clerkMiddleware((event) => {
  const { isAuthenticated } = event.context.auth()
  const isAdminRoute = event.path.startsWith('/api/admin')

  if (!isAuthenticated && isAdminRoute) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 401,
      statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: User not signed in',
    })
  }
})
```

### Authorization-based protection

To protect routes based on user authorization status, you can use the `has()` helper to check if the user has the required [privileges, such as a Role, Permission, Feature, or Plan](/docs/guides/secure/authorization-checks). The `has()` helper is available on the [`auth`](/docs/reference/nuxt/overview#auth-object) object.

#### Example: Protect routes based on Custom Permissions

In the following example, the `clerkMiddleware()` helper checks if the user is accessing a protected route. If so, it checks if the user has the required Custom Permission. If they don't, an error is thrown using Nuxt's [`createError()`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/create-error) utility.

```ts {{ filename: 'server/middleware/clerk.ts' }}
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

export default clerkMiddleware((event) => {
  const { has } = event.context.auth()
  const isInvoicesRoute = event.path.startsWith('/api/invoices')
  const canCreateInvoices = has({
    permission: 'org:invoices:create',
  })

  // Check if the user is accessing a protected route
  if (isInvoicesRoute) {
    // Check if the user has the required Permission
    if (!canCreateInvoices) {
      throw createError({
        statusCode: 403,
        statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: Missing Permission to create invoices',
      })
    }
  }
})
```

#### Example: Protect routes based on default Roles

> [!WARNING]
> It's best practice to use Permission-based authorization over Role-based authorization, as it reduces complexity and increases security. Usually, complex Role checks can be refactored with a single Permission check.

In the following example, the `clerkMiddleware()` helper checks if the user is accessing a protected route. If so, it checks if the user has the required admin Role. If they don't, an error is thrown using Nuxt's [`createError()`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/create-error) utility.

```ts {{ filename: 'server/middleware/clerk.ts' }}
import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

export default clerkMiddleware((event) => {
  const { has } = event.context.auth()
  const isAdminRoute = event.path.startsWith('/api/admin')
  const isAdmin = has({
    role: 'org:admin',
  })

  // Check if the user is accessing a protected route
  if (isAdminRoute) {
    // Check if the user has the required Role
    if (!isAdmin) {
      throw createError({
        statusCode: 403,
        statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: Admin access required',
      })
    }
  }
})
```

### Protect multiple routes

You can protect multiple routes at once by using Clerk's `createRouteMatcher()` helper function. The `createRouteMatcher()` helper accepts an array of route patterns and checks if the route the user is trying to visit matches one of the patterns passed to it.

Let's take the [first example](#authentication-based-protection) from this guide and add the `createRouteMatcher()` helper. Instead of only checking `/api/admin/**` routes, the following example checks both `/api/invoices/**` _and_ `/api/admin/**` routes.

```ts {{ filename: 'server/middleware/clerk.ts' }}
+ import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

  export default clerkMiddleware((event) => {
    const { isAuthenticated } = event.context.auth()
-   const isAdminRoute = event.path.startsWith('/api/admin')
+   const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/api/invoices(.*)', '/api/admin(.*)'])

    // Check if the user is not signed in
    // and is trying to access a protected route. If so, throw a 401 error.
    if (!isAuthenticated && isProtectedRoute(event)) {
      throw createError({
        statusCode: 401,
        statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: User not signed in',
      })
    }
  })
```

Now, let's add authorization-based protection to the example so that you can see how to combine everything you've learned so far.

```ts {{ filename: 'server/middleware/clerk.ts' }}
  import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nuxt/server'

  export default clerkMiddleware((event) => {
    const { isAuthenticated } = event.context.auth()
    const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher(['/api/invoices(.*)', '/api/admin(.*)'])
+   const canCreateInvoices = has({
+     permission: 'org:invoices:create',
+   })

    // Check if the user is not signed in
    // and is trying to access a protected route. If so, throw a 401 error.
    if (!isAuthenticated && isProtectedRoute(event)) {
      throw createError({
        statusCode: 401,
        statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: User not signed in',
      })
    }

+   // Check if the user doesn't have the required Permission
+   // and is accessing a protected route. If so, throw a 403 error.
+   if (!canCreateInvoices && isProtectedRoute(event)) {
+     throw createError({
+       statusCode: 403,
+       statusMessage: 'Unauthorized: Missing Permission to create invoices',
+     })
+   }
  })
```
