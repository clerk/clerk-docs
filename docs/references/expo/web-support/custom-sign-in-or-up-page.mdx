title: Build your own sign-in-or-up page with prebuilt components on web
description: Learn how to add custom sign-in-or-up page to your Expo app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) prebuilt component in order to build custom sign-in-or-up page for your Expo **web** app.

This guide uses [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) and the [platform-specific extensions](https://docs.expo.dev/router/create-pages/#platform-specific-extensions) to build the sign-in-or-up page specifically for the **web** platform.

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-in-or-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component to allow users to both sign-in or sign-up from a single flow.

  ```tsx filename="/app/sign-in.web.tsx"
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/clerk-expo/web'

  export default function Page() {
    return <SignIn />
  }
  ```

  ## Visit your new page

  To run your project, use the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash filename="terminal"
    npm run web
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    yarn web
    ```

    ```bash filename="terminal"
    pnpm web
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom pages locally at [localhost:8081/sign-in](http://localhost:8081/sign-in).
