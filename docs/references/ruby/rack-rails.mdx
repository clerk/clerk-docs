# Rack/Rails integration

## Rack middleware

The SDK comes with a Rack middleware which lazily loads the Clerk session and user. It inserts a clerk key in the Rack environment, which is an instance of `Clerk::Proxy`. To get the session or the user of the session, you call `session` or `user` respectively. In case there is no session, you can retrieve the API error with the `error` getter method.

## Rails integration

If you add the gem in a Rails app, the Rack middleware will be included automatically in the middleware stack. For easier access to the Clerk session and user, include the `Clerk::Authenticatable` concern in your controller:

```ruby
require "clerk/authenticatable"

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include Clerk::Authenticatable
end
```

This gives your controller and views access to the following methods:

- `clerk_session`
- `clerk_user`
- `clerk_user_signed_in?`

## Protected controllers

If you want to protect a subset of your controllers (for example, if you have an admin section), you can add a `before_filter` like this:

```ruby
class AdminsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :require_clerk_session

  private
  def require_clerk_session
    redirect_to clerk_sign_in_url unless clerk_session
  end
end
```

Don't forget to set the environment variable `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` or the method `clerk_sign_in_url` will fail.
