description: Learn how to use Clerk to quickly and easily add secure authentication and user management to your Next.js application.

# Overview

Clerk makes it simple to add authentication to your Next.js application. Looking to get started? Check out our [getting started guide](/docs/quickstarts/nextjs). If you want to learn more about the capabilities and methods available from Clerk's Next.js SDK, check out the reference content below.

## `authMiddleware()`

The authMiddleware() helper integrates Clerk authentication into your Next.js application through middleware. It's an important step in setting up your application. By default, Clerk's authMiddleware() treats all routes as private if the middleware runs. If you need to make specific routes public, you can learn more [here](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware).

## App Router

Clerk Next.js provides many helpers that are optimized specifically for Next.js's App Router.

- [`auth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/auth)
- [`currentUser()`](/docs/references/nextjs/current-user)
- [Route Handlers](/docs/references/nextjs/route-handlers)
- [Server Actions](/docs/references/nextjs/server-actions)

## Pages Router

Clerk Next.js also provides client side helpers, such as

- [`getAuth()`](/docs/references/nextjs/get-auth)
- [`buildClerkProps()`](/docs/references/nextjs/build-clerk-props)

## Other useful resources

- [withClerkMiddleware()](/docs/references/with-clerk-middleware) - will soon be deprecated in favor of `authMiddleware()`
