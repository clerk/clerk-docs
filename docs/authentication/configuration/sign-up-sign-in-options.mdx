description: Clerk provides various options for configuring a sign-up and sign-in flow.
---

Clerk provides multiple options for configuring a sign-up and sign-in flow for your application, such as [identifiers](#identifiers) and [authentication strategies](#authentication-strategies). This guide will walk you through each option.

You can modify your authentication options after your application has been created by navigating to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) and selecting the **User & Authentication** dropdown in the navigation sidebar.

## Identifiers

Identifiers are how your application recognizes an individual user. Clerk offers three primary identifiers:

- **Email address**
- **Phone number**
- **Username**

In the application configuration screen, you can select multiple identifiers, but at least one is required.

**Email address** is the most common primary identifier. During the sign-up process, a user must supply and verify their email address. They must keep an email address on their account at all times. However, the email address that was used for registration can be later changed from the user's profile page.

When **phone number** is selected as the identifier, a user can sign up with their phone number and receive a code via SMS to verify it. SMS functionality is restricted to phone numbers from countries enabled on your [SMS allowlist](#sms-allowlist).

> [!NOTE]
> SMS authentication is a premium feature and not available on the Free plan. [Upgrade your plan](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} to enable this feature.

Choosing **username** as the identifier enables users to sign up without requiring personal contact information. A username should be from 4 to 64 characters in length and can contain alphanumeric characters, underscores (\_), and dashes (-).

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose not to collect any contact information, you can enable **Username** authentication and later disable it in settings, opting to authenticate only with a social provider.

To update your identifiers after your application has been created:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) and select your application.
1. In the navigation sidebar, select **User & Authentication > Email, Phone, Username**.
1. In the **Contact information** section, you can select **Email address** and **Phone number** as identifiers. In the **Username** section, you can select **Username** as an identifier.

## Authentication strategies

Authentication strategies are methods that users can use to sign up and sign in to your application.

Clerk offers two kinds of authentication strategies: **password** and **passwordless**.

Choosing the **password** strategy requires users to set a password during the sign up process. Clerk offers out-of-the-box protection against weak and compromised passwords and the only requirement enforced is that the password be a miminum of 8 characters.

> [!NOTE]
> Passwordless authentication remains available to users, even if the password strategy is enabled.

The **passwordless** strategy provides a more secure and convenient sign-in method, as users don't need to remember complex passwords.

**Passwordless** authentication strategies include:

- **[Passkeys](#passkeys)**
- **[One-time password (OTP)](#one-time-password-otp)**
- **[Email link](#email-link)**

To configure authentication strategies:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) and select your application.
1. In the navigation sidebar, select **User & Authentication > Email, Phone, Username**.
1. In the **Authentication strategies** section, toggle on the authentication strategies you would like to enable.

### Passkeys

A passkey is a type of sign-in credential that requires one user action, but uses two authentication factors:

1. A pin number or biometric data
1. A physical device

Passkeys are the most secure **passwordless** strategy because they use two factors.

Users can only create passkeys after signing up, so you'll need to enable another authentication strategy for the sign-up process. After signing in, users can create a passkey.

#### Manage user passkeys

The easiest way to allow your users to create and manage their passkeys is to use the prebuilt [`<UserProfile>`](/docs/components/user/user-profile) component, which includes passkey management in the **Security** tab.

If you're building a custom user interface, refer to the [passkeys custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/passkeys) guide to learn how to create a custom passkey management flow using Clerks API.

#### Passkey limitations

- Passkeys are not currently available as an [MFA](#multi-factor-authentication) option.
- Not all devices and browsers are compatible with passkeys. Passkeys are built on WebAuthn technology and you should check [the Browser Compatibility docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API#browser_compatibility) for an up-to-date list.
- Passkey related APIs will not work with Expo.
- Your users can have a max of 10 passkeys per account.

#### Passkey behavior in development

Passkeys are associated with the domain they are created on, and cannot be used across domains.

For example, a passkey created in `localhost` will be associated with the `localhost` domain, and therefore, will not work with your app's [hosted Account Portal or sign-in pages](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview).

This won't affect production instances, as the production Account Portal is a subdomain of your app's domain.

### One-time password (OTP)

When one of the OTP options is selected as an authentication strategy, users receive a one-time code to complete the sign-in process. OTPs are more secure than passwords, as they allow user verification without storing passwords in your database.

There are two **one-time password (OTP)**, or one-time code, strategies to choose from:

- **Email verification code**
- **SMS verification code**

When email address is chosen as the identifier, **Email verification code** is set as the _default_ authentication option.

> [!NOTE]
> SMS authentication is a premium feature and is not available on the Free plan. [Upgrade your plan](/pricing){{ target: '_blank' }} to enable this feature.

#### SMS allowlist

SMS functionality, including SMS OTPs, is restricted to phone numbers from countries that are enabled on your SMS allowlist. This can be useful for avoiding extraneous SMS fees from countries from which your app is not expected to attract traffic.

Every instance starts off with a default set of enabled SMS country tiers. To tailor it to your needs:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=customization/sms).
1. In the navigation sidebar, select **Customization > SMS**.
1. Select the **Settings** tab.
1. Enable or disable countries as needed.

If a country is disabled, then phone numbers starting with the corresponding country calling code:

- Cannot receive OTPs and a request to receive an OTP will be rejected with an error
- Cannot receive notifications for password or passkey modifications
- Cannot be used upon sign-up
- Cannot be added to an existing user profile

### Email link

When the **Email verification link** option is selected as an authentication strategy, users receive an email with a link to complete the sign-in process. Email links can be used to sign up new users, sign in existing ones, or allow existing users to verify newly entered email addresses to their profile. Email links work on any device. There's no constraint on where the link can be opened. For example, a user might try to sign in from their desktop browser, but open the link from their mobile phone.

## Verification methods

Verification methods are the methods that users can use to verify their identifier during the sign-up process, or to verify a new identifier that they add to their profile.

Clerk offers three verification methods:

- **Email verification link**
- **Email verification code**
- **SMS verification code**

These methods work similarly to their authentication strategy counterparts but are used for verifying identifiers rather than authentication. For example, when a user adds an email address to their profile, they can receive an **Email verification link** or **Email verification code** to verify the new email address.

To configure verification methods:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/email-phone-username) and select your application.
1. In the navigation sidebar, select **User & Authentication > Email, Phone, Username**.
1. Select the settings cog icon next to the identifier, such as **Email address** or **Phone number**, to open the configuration settings.
1. Under the **Verification methods** section, toggle on the verification methods you would like to enable.
1. Select **Continue** to save your changes.

## Social connections (OAuth)

Clerk offers several [social providers](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview) for use during sign-up and sign-in. This authentication option is appealing because users often don't need to enter additional contact information since the provider already has it.

Clerk's OAuth process is designed to be seamless. If an existing user attempts to sign up with a social provider, the system automatically switches to sign-in. Similarly, if a user tries to sign in with a social provider but doesn't have an account, Clerk will automatically create one.

{/* TODO: Is this too much to add? */}

Users can link multiple social providers to their account, depending on your application's setup. You can configure your application to use the [Account Portal User Profile page](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview#user-profile), the prebuilt [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/components/user/user-profile) component, or [build your own custom user interface using the Clerk API](/docs/custom-flows/oauth-connections).

To enable social connections:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO connections**.
1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**.
1. For development instances, simply select the social providers that you would like to enable. For production instances, you'll need to configure credentials for each social provider. See [the social provider's dedicated guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/overview) to learn how to configure credentials.

## Web3 authentication

Clerk provides [Web3 authentication](/docs/users/web3) with either MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet. As part of validating the accuracy of the returned Web3 account address, Clerk handles the signing of a message and verifying the signature. Because sign-in with Web3 uses the same abstraction as our other authentication factors, like passwords or email links, other Clerk features like multi-factor authentication and profile enrichment work for Web3 users out-of-the-box.

To enable Web3 authentication:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/web3) and select your application.
1. In the navigation sidebar, select **User & Authentication > Web3**.
1. Toggle on the Web3 provider. Currently, Clerk supports MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet.

## Multi-factor authentication

Clerk supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), also known as two-factor authentication (2FA). If a user enables MFA for their account, they are required to complete a second verification step during sign-in. This enhances security by enforcing two different types of verification. Many websites offer this as an optional step, giving users control over their own security.

MFA is not available on the new application screen, but it can be enabled in the Clerk Dashboard.

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/multi-factor) and select your application.
1. In the navigation sidebar, select **User & Authentication > Multi-factor**.
1. Toggle on the MFA strategies you would like to enable.

Clerk currently offers the following MFA strategies:

- **SMS verification code**
- **Authenticator application (also known as TOTP - Time-based One-time Password)**
- **Backup codes**

Enabling MFA allows users of your app to turn it on for their own accounts through their [User Profile](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview#user-profile) page. Enabling MFA does not automatically turn on MFA for all users.

If you're building a custom user interface instead of using Clerk's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview) or [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview), you can use [Clerk elements](/docs/customization/elements/examples/sign-in#multi-factor-authentication-mfa) or use [Clerk's API](/docs/custom-flows/email-password-mfa) to build a custom sign-in flow that allows users to sign in with MFA.

### Reset a user's MFA

You can reset a user's MFA by deleting their MFA enrollments. This will remove all of their MFA methods and they will have to enroll in MFA again.

To reset a user's MFA:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/multi-factor).
1. In the top navigation, select **Users**.
1. Select the user from the list.
1. Select the **Reset MFA enrollments** button.

## Restrictions

Clerk provides a set of restriction options designed to provide you with enhanced control over who can gain access to your application. Restrictions can limit sign-ups or prevent accounts with specific identifiers, such as email addresses, phone numbers, and even entire domains, from accessing your application.
