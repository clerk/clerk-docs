# Overview

The Account Portal in Clerk is a powerful feature that allows you to streamline the sign-in, sign-up, and profile management experience for your users, without having to build your own components or host your own pages.

## Why use the Account Portal?

The Account Portal provides the pages necessary for your users to sign-up, sign-in, and manage their accounts, all while maintaining seamless integration with your application. These pages are hosted on Clerk servers for you and they require minimal setup to get started. If youâ€™re looking for the fastest way to add authentication and user management to your application, then this is a great choice.

However, if you require more precise customization or prefer having your application self-contained, then we would recommend using our fully customizable [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview), or you can build your own [custom flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview) instead.

## How the Account Portal works

The Account Portal utilizes our [prebuilt Clerk components](/docs/components/overview), which are embedded into dedicated pages hosted on Clerk servers. After a user has finished their flow in an Account Portal page, Clerk automatically redirects them back to your application by appending a `redirect_url` query param on the Account Portal page. This way, users are automatically redirected to and from your application for a seamless authentication experience. To integrate the Account Portal with your application, check out our [setup guide](/docs/account-portal/getting-started).

For each application environment, Clerk provides pages for sign-up, sign-in, user profile, organization profile, and organization creation flow.

For development environments, Clerk will issue you a randomly generated domain on "lcl.dev". In production, by default, the URLs for your Account Portal are the following:

```sh
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/sign-in
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/sign-up
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/user
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/organization
<https://accounts>.[your-domain].com/create-organization
```

You can access these links under **Account Portal -> Pages** in your Clerk dashboard.
