title: '`EmailAddress`'
description: The EmailAddress object is a model around an email address.
---

The `EmailAddress` object is a model around an email address. Email addresses are used to provide identification for users.

Email addresses must be **verified** to ensure that they can be assigned to their rightful owners. The `EmailAddress` object holds all necessary state around the verification process.

- The verification process always starts with the [`prepareVerification()`](#prepare-verification) method, which will send a one-time verification code via an email message.
- The second and final step involves an attempt to complete the verification by calling the [`attemptVerification()`](#attempt-verification) method, passing the one-time code as a parameter.

## Properties

<Properties>
  - `id`
  - `string`

  The unique identifier for this email address.

  ---

  - `emailAddress`
  - `string`

  The value of this email address.

  ---

  - `verification`
  - [`Verification`](/docs/references/javascript/types/verification)

  An object holding information on the verification of this email address.

  ---

  - `linkedTo`
  - `Array<{id: string, type: string}>`

  An array of objects containing information about any identifications that might be linked to this email address.
</Properties>

## Methods

### `create()`

Creates a new email address for the current user.

```typescript
function create(): Promise<EmailAddress>
```

### `destroy()`

Deletes this email address.

```typescript
function destroy(): Promise<void>
```

### `toString()`

Returns the value for this email address. Can also be accessed via the `EmailAddress.emailAddress` attribute.

```typescript
function toString(): string
```

### `prepareVerification()`

Kick off the verification process for this email address. An email message with a one-time code or an email-link will be sent to the email address box.

```typescript
function prepareVerification(params: PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<EmailAddress>
```

#### `PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `strategy`
  - `'email_link' | 'email_code'`

  The verification strategy. Supported strategies are:

  - `email_link`: User will receive an email link via email.
  - `email_code`: User will receive a one-time authentication code via email.

  ---

  - `redirectUrl`
  - `string | undefined`

  **Required** if `strategy` is set to `email_link`. The full URL that the user will be redirected to when they visit the email link. See the [custom flow](/docs/custom-flows/email-links) for implementation details.
</Properties>

### `attemptVerification()`

Attempts to verify this email address, passing the one-time code that was sent as an email message. The code will be sent when calling the [EmailAddress.prepareVerification()](#prepare-verification) method.

```typescript
function attemptVerification(params: AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<EmailAddress>
```

#### `AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams`

<Properties>
  - `code`
  - `string`

  The one-time code that was sent to the user's email address when [EmailAddress.prepareVerification()](#prepare-verification) was called with `strategy` set to `email_code`.
</Properties>

### `createEmailLinkFlow()`

Sets up an email verification with email link flow. Calling `createEmailLinkFlow()` will return two functions.

The first function is async and starts the email link flow, preparing a email link verification. It sends the email link email and starts polling for verification results. The signature is `startEmailLinkFlow({ redirectUrl: string }) => Promise<EmailAddress>`.

The second function can be used to stop polling at any time, allowing for full control of the flow and cleanup. The signature is `cancelEmailLinkFlow() => void`.

```typescript
function createEmailLinkFlow(): {
  startEmailLinkFlow: (params: StartEmailLinkFlowParams) => Promise<EmailAddress>
  cancelEmailLinkFlow: () => void
}
```

#### Returns

`createEmailLinkFlow` returns an object with two functions:

<Properties>
  - `startEmailLinkFlow`
  - <code>(params: [StartEmailLinkFlowParams](#start-email-link-flow-params)) => Promise\<EmailAddress></code>

  Function to start the email link flow. It prepares a email link verification and polls for the verification result.

  ---

  - `cancelEmailLinkFlow`
  - `() => void`

  Function to cleanup the email link flow. Stops waiting for verification results.
</Properties>

#### `StartEmailLinkFlowParams`

<Properties>
  - `redirectUrl`
  - `string`

  The full URL that the user will be redirected to when they visit the email link.
</Properties>
