# `useOrganizationList()`

The `useOrganizationList()` hook allows you to retrieve the memberships, invitations, or suggestions for an active user. This hook also gives you the ability to create an organization and set the active organization.

## `useOrganizationList()` parameters

`useOrganizationList()` accepts a single object with the following properties:

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `userMemberships` | `true` or an object with any of the properties described in [Shared properties](#shared-properties). If set to `true`, all default properties will be used. |
| `userInvitations` | `true` or an object with [`status: OrganizationInvitationStatus`](#organization-invitation-status) or any of the properties described in [Shared properties](#shared-properties). If set to `true`, all default properties will be used. |
| `userSuggestions` | `true` or an object with [`status: OrganizationSuggestionsStatus \| OrganizationSuggestionStatus[]`](#organization-suggestion-status) or any of the properties described in [Shared properties](#shared-properties). If set to `true`, all default properties will be used. |

<Callout type="warning">
  By default, the `userMemberships`, `userInvitations`, and `userSuggestions` attributes are not populated. You must pass `true` or an object with the desired [properties](#shared-properties) to fetch and paginate the data.
</Callout>

### Shared properties

Parameters that are shared across the `invitations`, `membershipRequests`, `memberships`, and `domains` properties.

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `initialPage?` | A number that can be used to skip the first n-1 pages. For example, if `initialPage` is set to 10, it is will skip the first 9 pages and will fetch the 10th page. Defaults to `1`. |
| `pageSize?` | A number that indicates the maximum number of results that should be returned for a specific page. Defaults to `10`. |
| `keepPreviousData?` | If `true`, it will persist the cached data until the new data has been fetched. Defaults to `false`. |
| `infinite?` | If `true`, the new downloaded data will be appended to the list with the existing data. Ideal for infinite lists. Defaults to `false`. |

### `OrganizationInvitationStatus`

`useOrganizationList()` accepts `status` as a property for the `userInvitations` parameter.

`status` is a string that can be one of the following:

```typescript
type OrganizationInvitationStatus = "pending" | "accepted" | "revoked";
```

### `OrganizationSuggestionsStatus`

`useOrganizationList()` accepts `status` as a property for the `userSuggestions` parameter.

`status` can be a string that can be one of the following, or an array of the following:

```typescript
type OrganizationSuggestionStatus = "pending" | "accepted";
```

## `useOrganizationList()` returns

| `createOrganization()` | <code>(params: [CreateOrganizationParams](#create-organization-params)) => Promise\<[OrganizationResource](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization)\></code> | A function that returns a `Promise` which resolves to the newly created `Organization`. |
| `setActive()` | <code>(params: [SetActiveParams](#set-active-params)) => Promise\<void\></code> | A function that sets the active session and/or organization. |
| `userMemberships` | [`PaginatedResources`](#paginatedresources) | Returns `PaginatedResources` which includes a list of the user's organization memberships. |
| `userInvitations` | [`PaginatedResources`](#paginatedresources) | Returns `PaginatedResources` which includes a list of the user's organization invitations. |
| `userSuggestions` | [`PaginatedResources`](#paginatedresources) | Returns `PaginatedResources` which includes a list of suggestions for organizations that the user can join. |

### `CreateOrganizationParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | The name of the organization. |
| `slug?` | `string` | The slug of the organization. |

### `SetActiveParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

## How to use the `useOrganizationList()` hook

### Expanding and paginating attributes

To keep network usage to a minimum, developers are required to opt-in by specifying which resource they need to fetch and paginate through. So by default, the `userMemberships`, `userInvitations`, and `userSuggestions` attributes are not populated. You must pass `true` or an object with the desired [properties](#shared-properties) to fetch and paginate the data.

```jsx
// userMemberships.data will never be populated
const { userMemberships } = useOrganizationList();

// Use default values to fetch userMemberships, such as initialPage = 1 and pageSize = 10
const { userMemberships } = useOrganizationList({
  userMemberships: true
});

// Pass your own values to fetch userMemberships
const { userMemberships } = useOrganizationList({
  userMemberships: {
    pageSize: 20,
    initialPage: 2, // skips the first page
  }
});

// Aggregate pages in order to render an infinite list
const { userMemberships } = useOrganizationList({
  userMemberships: {
    infinite: true,
  }
});
```

### Infinite pagination

The following example demonstrates how to use the `infinite` property to fetch and append new data to the existing list. The `userMemberships` attribute will be populated with the first page of the user's organization memberships. When the "Load more" button is clicked, the `fetchNext` helper function will be called to append the next page of memberships to the list.

```tsx filename="joined-organizations.tsx"
import { useOrganizationList } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
import React from "react";

const JoinedOrganizationList = () => {
  const { isLoaded, setActive, userMemberships } = useOrganizationList({
    userMemberships: {
      infinite: true,
    },
  });

  if (!isLoaded) {
    return <>Loading</>;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <ul>
        {userMemberships.data?.map((mem) => (
          <li key={mem.id}>
            <span>{mem.organization.name}</span>
            <button
              onClick={() => setActive({ organization: mem.organization.id })}
            >
              Select
            </button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <button
        disabled={!userMemberships.hasNextPage}
        onClick={() => userMemberships.fetchNext()}
      >
        Load more
      </button>
    </>
  );
};

export default JoinedOrganizationList;
```

### Simple pagination

The following example demonstrates how to use the `fetchPrevious` and `fetchNext` helper functions to paginate through the data. The `userInvitations` attribute will be populated with the first page of invitations. When the "Previous page" or "Next page" button is clicked, the `fetchPrevious` or `fetchNext` helper function will be called to fetch the previous or next page of invitations.

Notice the difference between this example's pagination and the infinite pagination example above.

```tsx filename="joined-organizations.tsx"
import { useOrganizationList } from "@clerk/clerk-react";
import React from "react";

const InvitationsTable = () => {
  const { isLoaded, userInvitations } = useOrganizationList({
    userInvitations: {
      infinite: true,
      keepPreviousData: true,
    },
  });

  if (!isLoaded || userInvitations.isLoading) {
    return <>Loading</>;
  }

  return (
    <>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Email</th>
            <th>Org name</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>

        <tbody>
          {userInvitations.data?.map((inv) => (
            <tr key={inv.id}>
              <th>{inv.emailAddress}</th>
              <th>{inv.publicOrganizationData.name}</th>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <button
        disabled={!userInvitations.hasPreviousPage}
        onClick={userInvitations.fetchPrevious}
      >
        Prev
      </button>
      <button
        disabled={!userInvitations.hasNextPage}
        onClick={userInvitations.fetchNext}
      >
        Next
      </button>
    </>
  );
};

export default InvitationsTable;
```
