The `clerkMiddleware()` helper integrates Clerk authentication into your React Router application through middleware.

## Configure `clerkMiddleware()`

1. React Router middleware requires opting in via a future flag. Add the following to your `react-router.config.ts` file:

   ```ts {{ filename: 'react-router.config.ts', mark: [[6, 8]] }}
   import type { Config } from '@react-router/dev/config'

   export default {
     // ...

     future: {
       v8_middleware: true,
     },
   } satisfies Config
   ```

1. Export `clerkMiddleware()` from your root route file:

   ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/root.tsx' }}
   import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/react-router/server'
   import type { Route } from './+types/root'

   export const middleware: Route.MiddlewareFunction[] = [clerkMiddleware()]
   ```
