This guide will teach you how to add native Sign in with Apple to your Clerk apps on Apple platforms.

<Steps>

  ## Add your Native Application

  Add your iOS application to the [Native Applications](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=/native-applications) page in the Clerk dashboard.

  ## Configure the Apple social connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [SSO Connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Apple**.
  1. Then, select **Add connection**.

  ## Add the Sign in with Apple capability to your app

  [Add the Sign in with Apple capability to your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-sign-in-with-apple#Add-the-Sign-in-with-Apple-capability-to-your-app).

  ## Obtain an Apple ID Credential

  To authenticate with Apple and Clerk, you need to obtain an [Apple ID Credential](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidcredential).

  To obtain an Apple ID Credential, you can do one of the following:

  - Use one of [Apple's built-in Sign in with Apple buttons](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/displaying_sign_in_with_apple_buttons_in_your_app).
  - Use Clerk's [SignInWithAppleHelper](https://swiftpackageindex.com/clerk/clerk-ios/main/documentation/clerk/signinwithapplehelper) class.
  - Obtain it manually by following [the Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sign_in_with_apple/).

  > [!NOTE]
  > You must set the nonce property of the `ASAuthorizationAppleIDRequest` when requesting an Apple ID Credential in order to authenticate with Clerk.

  ## Build your sign-in flow

  Once you have obtained your [Apple ID Credential](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationappleidcredential), you can use it to authenticate with Clerk by calling [`SignIn.authenticateWithIdToken(provider:idToken:)`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/clerk/clerk-ios/main/documentation/clerk/signin/authenticatewithidtoken\(provider:idtoken:\)) with a provider of `.apple` and the `idToken` you have obtained.

  The following example uses Apple's built-in `SignInWithAppleButton` to obtain an Apple ID Credential and calls `SignIn.authenticateWithIdToken(provider:idToken:)` to authenticate with Clerk.

  ```swift {{ filename: 'SignInWithAppleView.swift' }}
  import SwiftUI
  import Clerk
  import AuthenticationServices

  struct SignInWithAppleView: View {
    var body: some View {
      // Use Apple's built-in SignInWithAppleButton
      SignInWithAppleButton { request in
        request.requestedScopes = [.email, .fullName]
        request.nonce = UUID().uuidString // Setting the nonce is mandatory
      } onCompletion: { result in
        Task {
          // Access the Apple ID Credential
          guard let credential = try result.get().credential as? ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential else {
            dump("Unable to get credential of type ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential")
            return
          }

          // Access the necessary identity token on the Apple ID Credential
          guard let idToken = credential.identityToken.flatMap({ String(data: $0, encoding: .utf8) }) else {
            dump("Unable to get ID token from Apple ID Credential.")
            return
          }

          // Authenticate with Clerk
          let authResult = try await SignIn.authenticateWithIdToken(provider: .apple, idToken: idToken)
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
</Steps>
