# `<Protect>`

The `<Protect>` component is used for authorization. It only renders its children when the current user has the specified [permission or role](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions) in the organization.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `condition?` | `has => boolean` | Optional conditional logic that renders the children if it returns `true`. |
| `fallback?` | `JSX` | An optional snippet of JSX to show when a user doesn't have the `role` or `permission` to access the protected content. |
| `permission?` | `string` | Optional string corresponding to a Role's Permission in the format `org:<resource>:<action>` |
| `role?` | `string` | Optional string corresponding to an Organization's Role in the format `org:<role>` |

> [!WARNING]
> `<Protect>` can only accept `permission` _or_ `role`, not both. The recommended approach is to use `permission`.

## Usage

To limit who is able to see the content that `<Protect>` renders, you can pass either the `permission` or `role` prop. The recommended approach is to use `permission` because this lets you modify roles without breaking your application. Permissions can be assigned to different roles with ease.

If you do not pass either prop, `<Protect>` behaves the same as [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/components/control/signed-in) and will render its children if the user is signed in, regardless of their role or its permissions.

For more complex authorization logic, [pass conditional logic to the `condition` prop](#render-content-conditionally).

### Render content by permissions

The children of the following component will only be visible to users with roles that have the `org:invoices:create` permission.

<Tabs items={["Next.js", "React"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```jsx {{ prettier: false }}
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          permission="org:invoices:create"
          fallback={<p>You do not have the permissions to create an invoice.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```jsx {{ prettier: false }}
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          permission="org:invoices:create"
          fallback={<p>You do not have the permissions to create an invoice.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Render content by role

While authorization by `permission` is recommended, for convenience, `<Protect>` allows a `role` prop to be passed. The children of the following component will only be visible to users with the `org:billing` role.

<Tabs items={["Next.js", "React"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```jsx {{ prettier: false }}
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          role="org:billing"
          fallback={<p>Only a member of the Billing department can access this content.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```jsx {{ prettier: false }}
    import { Protect } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

    export default function ProtectPage() {
      return (
        <Protect
          role="org:billing"
          fallback={<p>Only a member of the Billing department can access this content.</p>}
        >
          {children}
        </Protect>
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Render content conditionally

The following example uses `<Protect>`'s `condition` prop to conditionally render its children if the user has the correct role.

<Tabs items={["Next.js"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```tsx {{ prettier: false, filename: '/app/dashboard/settings/layout.tsx' }}
      import type { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
      import { Protect } from "@clerk/nextjs";

      export default function SettingsLayout(props: PropsWithChildren){
        return (
          <Protect
            condition={has => has({role: "org:admin"}) || has({role: "org:billing_manager"})}
            fallback={<p>Only an Admin or Billing Manager can access this content.</p>}
          >
            {props.children}
          </Protect>
        )
      }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
