The Backend `CommerceSubscriptionItem` object is similar to the [`CommerceSubscriptionItem`](/docs/references/javascript/types/commerce-subscription-item-resource) object as it holds information about a subscription item, as well as methods for managing it. However, the Backend `CommerceSubscriptionItem` object is different in that it is used in the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organizations#operation/ListOrganizations){{ target: '_blank' }} and is not directly accessible from the Frontend API.
