Marks the given [`User`](/docs/reference/backend/types/backend-user) as banned, which means that all their sessions are revoked and they are not allowed to sign in again.

```ts
function banUser(userId: string): Promise<User>
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `userId`
  - `string`

  The ID of the user to ban.
</Properties>

## Example

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

```tsx
const userId = 'user_123'

const response = await clerkClient.users.banUser(userId)
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `POST/users/{user_id}/ban`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/users/post/users/\{user_id}/ban){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
