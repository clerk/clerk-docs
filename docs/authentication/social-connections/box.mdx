How to set up social connection with Box

## Overview

Adding social connection with Box to your app with Clerk is done in a few steps - you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your Box account.

> The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Box developer account and a Box OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social connection (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social connection (OAuth) guide](/docs/authentication/social-connections/oauth).

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Box developer account. To create one, [click here](https://developer.box.com/).

## Configuring Box social connection

First, you need to create a new OAuth2 Box app. You can find this option in your **Console > Create new app**. Choose **Custom App** and then select **User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)**.

You need to choose an app name and then click **Create application**.

Go to the [Social Connections page](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=authentication/social) in your Clerk Dashboard and enable Box. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Make sure the value matches the **Redirect URIs**, as shown below.

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Congratulations! Social connection with Box is now configured for your instance.
