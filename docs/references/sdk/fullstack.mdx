# Fullstack SDK

A fullstack SDK combines the [frontend-only SDK](/docs/references/sdk/frontend-only) and [backend-only SDK](/docs/references/sdk/backend-only) into one. A fullstack SDK is necessary for frameworks that support multiple rendering strategies (SSR, SSG, etc.), middleware, data fetching, and more. Examples of such frameworks would be Next.js or Rails.

## Expected features

- User only needs to provide their [publishable key](/docs/references/sdk/terminology) and [secret key](/docs/references/sdk/terminology)
- User only needs to adjust one or two files to add Clerk to their app (e.g. adding Clerk to the configuration file of that framework)
- User can use [Clerk’s components](/docs/components/overview) in their choice of framework (e.g. in a React-based framework you import these components as React components)
- Give users access to [`Client`](/docs/references/javascript/client){{ target: '_blank' }}, [`Session`](/docs/references/javascript/session){{ target: '_blank' }}, [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user){{ target: '_blank' }}, and [`Organization`](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization){{ target: '_blank' }} properties through the framework’s choice of state management
- User should be able to use [ClerkJS options](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk#clerk-options){{ target: '_blank' }}
- Centralized request authentication (e.g. in a middleware or plugin)
- Give access to the instance of [BAPI](/docs/references/sdk/terminology) client (so that users can use all methods)
- User should be able to limit access to routes by checking for [roles and permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions)

## Optional features

- User should be able to enforce authentication on individual routes (e.g. with a [`requireAuth`](/docs/references/sdk/backend-only#create-a-require-auth-helper) helper)
- Use singleton pattern to only create a pre-configured instance of Clerk backend client

## Implementation

Please check out the respective [frontend-only SDK](/docs/references/sdk/frontend-only) and [backend-only SDK](/docs/references/sdk/backend-only) implementation instructions.
