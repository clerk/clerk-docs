</TutorialHero>

<Steps>

### Install `@clerk/nextjs`

Clerk's Next.js SDK gives you access to prebuilt [components](/docs/components/overview), [hooks](/docs/references/nextjs/overview#client-side-helpers), and [helpers](/docs/references/nextjs/overview) for Next.js Server Components, Route Handlers and Middleware. Install it by running the following command in your terminal:

<CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  ```bash filename="terminal"
  npm install @clerk/nextjs
  ```

```bash filename="terminal"
yarn add @clerk/nextjs
```

```bash filename="terminal"
pnpm add @clerk/nextjs
```

</CodeBlockTabs>

### Set environment keys

In your Next.js project's root folder, you may have an `.env.local` file alongside `package.json` and other configuration files. If you don't see it, create it.

Add the following code to your `.env.local` file to set your public and secret keys.

**Pro tip!** If you are signed into your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=api-keys), your secret key should become visible by clicking on the eye icon.

<InjectKeys>

```sh filename=".env.local"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
```

</InjectKeys>

This sets your public and secret keys.

### Wrap your app in `<ClerkProvider />`

The [`<ClerkProvider />`](/docs/components/clerk-provider) component provides active session and user context to Clerk's hooks and other components. Import it into your app by adding `import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'` at the top of your file.

<Tabs type="router" items={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
  <Tab>
    <Callout>
      The `app/layout.tsx` file might be in your `src` folder if it isn't in your root folder.
    </Callout>

    For this project, it makes sense to wrap the `<html />` element with `<ClerkProvider />`. This makes the active session and user context accessible anywhere within the app.

    ```tsx filename="/src/app/layout.tsx" {1,10,14}
    import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/nextjs'
    import './globals.css'

    export default function RootLayout({
      children,
    }: {
      children: React.ReactNode
    }) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider>
          <html lang="en">
            <body>{children}</body>
          </html>
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    }
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    For this project, it makes sense to wrap the `<Component />` element with `<ClerkProvider />`. This makes the active session and user context accessible anywhere within `MyApp`.

    ```tsx filename="_app.tsx" {2,6,8}
      import '@/styles/globals.css'
      import { ClerkProvider } from "@clerk/nextjs";
      import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
      function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
        return (
          <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
          </ClerkProvider>
        );
      }
      export default MyApp;
      ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Require authentication to access your app

Now that Clerk is installed and mounted in your application, you can decide which pages are public and which should require authentication to access.

Create a `middleware.ts` file. If your application uses the `src/` directory, your `middleware.ts` file should be placed inside the `src/` folder. If you are not using a `src/` directory, place the `middleware.ts` file in your root directory alongside `.env.local`.

Copy and paste the following code into your `middleware.ts`. With this, your entire application is protected.

```tsx filename="middleware.ts"
import { authMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs";

// This example protects all routes including api/trpc routes
// Please edit this to allow other routes to be public as needed.
// See https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware for more information about configuring your Middleware
export default authMiddleware({});

export const config = {
  matcher: ["/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)", "/", "/(api|trpc)(.*)"],
};
```

**Try accessing your app now by visiting [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).** The Middleware will redirect you to your Sign Up page, provided by Clerk's [Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview) feature. If you want to make other routes public, check out the [`authMiddleware` reference page](/docs/references/nextjs/auth-middleware). Go ahead and sign up to get access to your application. Your app is now fully protected by Clerk!

### Embed the `<UserButton />`

Clerk offers a set of [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) to add functionality to your app with minimal effort. The [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button) allows users to manage their account information and log out, completing the full authentication circle.

Add the `<UserButton />` anywhere inside `<ClerkProvider />` in your app. First, add `import { UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";` to the top of your file. Then, add `<UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/"/>`. The `afterSignOutUrl` prop lets you customize what page the user will be redirected to after sign out.

<CodeBlockTabs type="router" options={["App Router", "Pages Router"]}>
```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" {1,6}
import { UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="h-screen">
      <UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/"/>
    </div>
  )
}
```

```tsx filename="pages/index.tsx" {1,7}
import { UserButton } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <>
      <header>
        <UserButton afterSignOutUrl="/" />
      </header>
      <div>Your home page's content can go here.</div>
    </>
  );
}
```

</CodeBlockTabs>

### Sign out of your application

Visit your Next.js application at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000), click on your avatar, and select **Sign out**. You are now back where you started: a sign-in form.

### Deploy your application

You're ready to [deploy your app to production](/docs/deployments/overview) and welcome new users!

</Steps>

## You're authenticated!

Congratulations! Your app is now only available to authenticated users. But this is just the first step.
