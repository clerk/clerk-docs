# `useOrganization()`

The `useOrganization()` hook is used to retrieve attributes of the currently active organization.

## `useOrganization()` parameters

`useOrganization()` accepts a single object with the following optional properties:

| Properties | Description |
| - | - |
| `invitations?` | `true` or an object with [`status: OrganizationInvitationStatus`](#organization-invitation-status) or any of the properties described in [Shared properties](#shared-properties). If set to `true`, all default properties will be used. |
| `membershipRequests?` | `true` or an object with [`status: OrganizationInvitationStatus`](#organization-invitation-status) or any of the properties described in [Shared properties](#shared-properties). If set to `true`, all default properties will be used. |
| `memberships?` | `true` or an object with [`role: OrganizationCustomRoleKey[]`](#organization-custome-role-key) or any of the properties described in [Shared properties](#shared-properties). If set to `true`, all default properties will be used. |
| `domains?` | `true` or an object with [`enrollmentMode: OrganizationEnrollmentMode`](#organization-enrollment-mode) or any of the properties described in [Shared properties](#shared-properties). If set to `true`, all default properties will be used. |

<Callout type="warning">
  By default, the `memberships`, `invitations`, `membershipRequests`, and `domains` attributes are not populated. You must pass `true` or an object with the desired [properties](#shared-properties) to fetch and paginate the data.
</Callout>

### Shared properties

Properties that are shared across the `invitations`, `membershipRequests`, `memberships`, and `domains` properties.

| Properties | Description |
| - | - |
| `initialPage?` | A number that can be used to skip the first n-1 pages. For example, if `initialPage` is set to 10, it is will skip the first 9 pages and will fetch the 10th page. Defaults to `1`. |
| `pageSize?` | A number that indicates the maximum number of results that should be returned for a specific page. Defaults to `10`. |
| `keepPreviousData?` | If `true`, it will persist the cached data until the new data has been fetched. Defaults to `false`. |
| `infinite?` | If `true`, the new downloaded data will be appended to the list with the existing data. Ideal for infinite lists. Defaults to `false`. |

### `OrganizationInvitationStatus`

`useOrganization()` accepts `status` as a property for the `invitations` and `membershipRequests` parameters.

`status` is a string that can be one of the following:

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
type OrganizationInvitationStatus = "pending" | "accepted" | "revoked";
```

### `OrganizationCustomRoleKey`

`useOrganization` accepts `role` as a property for the `memberships` parameter.

`role` is a string that represents the user's role in the organization. Clerk provides the [default roles](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#default-roles) `org:admin` and `org:member`. However, you can create [custom roles](/docs/organizations/create-roles-permissions) as well.

### `OrganizationEnrollmentMode`

`useOrganization()` accepts `enrollmentMode` as a property for the `domains` paramater.

`enrollmentMode` is a string that can be one of the following:

```typescript {{ prettier: false }}
type OrganizationEnrollmentMode = "manual_invitation" | "automatic_invitation" | "automatic_suggestion";
```

<Callout type="info">
  These attributes are updating automatically and will re-render their respective components whenever you set a different organization using the [`setActive({ organization })`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/session-methods#set-active) method or update any of the memberships or invitations. No need for you to manage updating anything manually.
</Callout>

## `useOrganization()` returns

| Name | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `isLoaded` | `boolean` | A boolean that is set to `false` until Clerk loads and initializes. |
| `organization` | [`Organization`](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) | The currently active organization. |
| `membership` | [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/references/javascript/organization-membership) | The current organization membership. |
| `memberships` | [`PaginatedResources`](#paginated-resources) | Includes a paginated list of the organization's memberships. |
| `invitations` | [`PaginatedResources`](#paginated-resources) | Includes a paginated list of the organization's invitations. |
| `membershipRequests` | [`PaginatedResources`](#paginated-resources) | Includes a paginated list of the organization's membership requests. |
| `domains` | [`PaginatedResources`](#paginated-resources) | Includes a paginated list of the organization's domains. |

### `PaginatedResources`

| Variables | Description |
| - | - |
| `data` | An array that contains the fetched data. |
| `count` | The total count of data that exist remotely. |
| `isLoading` | A boolean that is `true` if there is an ongoing request and there is no fetched data. |
| `isFetching` | A boolean that is `true` if there is an ongoing request or a revalidation. |
| `isError` | A boolean that indicates the request failed. |
| `page` | A number that indicates the current page. |
| `pageCount` | A number that indicates the total amount of pages. It is calculated based on `count` , `initialPage` , and `pageSize` |
| `fetchPage` | A function that triggers a specific page to be loaded. |
| `fetchPrevious` | A helper function that triggers the previous page to be loaded. This is the same as `fetchPage(page=> Math.max(0, page - 1))` |
| `fetchNext` | A helper function that triggers the next page to be loaded. This is the same as `fetchPage(page=> Math.min(pageCount, page + 1))` |
| `hasNextPage` | A boolean that indicates if there are available pages to be fetched. |
| `hasPreviousPage` | A boolean that indicates if there are available pages to be fetched. |
| `revalidate` | A function that triggers a revalidation of the current page. |
| `setData` | A function that allows you to set the data manually. |

## How to use the `useOrganization()` hook

### Expanding and paginating attributes

To keep network usage to a minimum, developers are required to opt-in by specifying which resource they need to fetch and paginate through. So by default, the `memberships`, `invitations`, `membershipRequests`, and `domains` attributes are not populated. You must pass `true` or an object with the desired [properties](#shared-properties) to fetch and paginate the data.

```jsx {{ prettier: false }}
// invitations.data will never be populated.
const { invitations } = useOrganization();

// Use default values to fetch invitations, such as initialPage = 1 and pageSize = 10
const { invitations } = useOrganization({
  invitations: true
});

// Pass your own values to fetch invitations
const { invitations } = useOrganization({
  invitations: {
    pageSize: 20,
    initialPage: 2, // skips the first page
  }
});

// Aggregate pages in order to render an infinite list
const { invitations } = useOrganization({
  invitations: {
    infinite: true,
  }
});
```

### Infinite pagination

The following example demonstrates how to use the `infinite` property to fetch and append new data to the existing list. The `memberships` attribute will be populated with the first page of the organization's memberships. When the "Load more" button is clicked, the `fetchNext` helper function will be called to append the next page of memberships to the list.

```jsx {{ prettier: false }}
import { useOrganization } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export default function MemberList() {
  const { memberships } = useOrganization({
    memberships: {
      infinite: true, // Append new data to the existing list
      keepPreviousData: true, // Persist the cached data until the new data has been fetched
    },
  });

  if (!memberships) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Organization members</h2>
      <ul>
        {memberships.data?.map((membership) => (
          <li key={membership.id}>
            {membership.publicUserData.firstName} {membership.publicUserData.lastName} &lt;
            {membership.publicUserData.identifier}&gt; :: {membership.role}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <button
        disabled={!memberships.hasNextPage} // Disable the button if there are no more available pages to be fetched
        onClick={memberships.fetchNext}
      >
        Load more
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Simple pagination

The following example demonstrates how to use the `fetchPrevious` and `fetchNext` helper functions to paginate through the data. The `memberships` attribute will be populated with the first page of the organization's memberships. When the "Previous page" or "Next page" button is clicked, the `fetchPrevious` or `fetchNext` helper function will be called to fetch the previous or next page of memberships.

Notice the difference between this example's pagination and the infinite pagination example above.

```jsx {{ prettier: false }}
import { useOrganization } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

export default function MemberList() {
  const { memberships } = useOrganization({
    memberships: {
      keepPreviousData: true, // Persist the cached data until the new data has been fetched
    },
  });

  if (!memberships) {
    // Handle loading state
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Organization members</h2>
      <ul>
        {memberships.data?.map((membership) => (
          <li key={membership.id}>
            {membership.publicUserData.firstName} {membership.publicUserData.lastName} &lt;
            {membership.publicUserData.identifier}&gt; :: {membership.role}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <button
        disabled={!memberships.hasPreviousPage}
        onClick={memberships.fetchPrevious}
      >
        Previous page
      </button>

      <button
        disabled={!memberships.hasNextPage}
        onClick={memberships.fetchNext}
      >
        Next page
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
