  - Use Linear to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [Linear](https://developers.linear.app/docs/oauth/authentication) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk app with their Linear account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be a workspace admin to create and manage OAuth apps in Linear.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and choose **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Linear**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your Linear account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Linear's API settings](https://linear.app/clerk/settings/api) page.

<Steps>
  ### Enable Linear as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and choose **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Linear**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URIs** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create a Linear app

  1. In Linear, in the top-right, select your workspace then select **Preferences**.
  1. In the sidebar, under **My Account**, select **API** then scroll down to **OAuth Applications** to navigate to the [**Create new application form**](https://linear.app/clerk/settings/api/applications/new).
  1. Complete the required fields. In **Callback URLs**, paste the Redirect URL you saved from the Clerk Dashboard. Keep this page open.
  1. TODO

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  1. In Linear, TODO.
  1. Navigate back to your Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open and paste these values into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the Linear connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal) page.
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:

  - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
  - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`

  1. Sign in with your Linear account.
