Clerk ensures that security critical nonces are passed only to allowlisted URLs when the SSO flow is completed in native browsers or webviews. For maximum security in your **production** instances, you need to allowlist your custom redirect URLs via the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) or the [Clerk Backend API](/docs/reference/backend/redirect-urls/create-redirect-url).

To allowlist a redirect URL via the Clerk Dashboard:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Native applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/native-applications) page.
1. Scroll down to the **Allowlist for mobile SSO redirect** section and add your redirect URLs.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, Clerk uses `{bundleIdentifier}://callback` as the redirect URL.
