/>

<Steps>
  ## Enable Native API

  <Include src="_partials/native-api-callout" />

  ## Create a new Expo app

  If you don't already have an Expo app, run the following commands to [create a new one](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/create-your-first-app/).

  ```npm
  npx create-expo-app@latest clerk-expo
  cd clerk-expo
  npm install
  ```

  ## Install `@clerk/clerk-expo`

  The [Clerk Expo SDK](/docs/reference/expo/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  ```npm
  npm install @clerk/clerk-expo
  ```

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  <Include src="_partials/quickstarts/set-clerk-publishable-key" />

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  ```

  ## Add `<ClerkProvider>` to your root layout

  <Include src="_partials/clerk-provider/explanation" />

  Add the component to your root layout, as shown in the following example:

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/_layout.tsx' }}
    import { useColorScheme } from '@/hooks/use-color-scheme'
  + import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'
    import { DarkTheme, DefaultTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@react-navigation/native'
    import { Stack } from 'expo-router'
    import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar'
    import 'react-native-reanimated'

    export const unstable_settings = {
      anchor: '(tabs)',
    }

    export default function RootLayout() {
      const colorScheme = useColorScheme()

      return (
        <ThemeProvider value={colorScheme === 'dark' ? DarkTheme : DefaultTheme}>
  +       <ClerkProvider>
            <Stack>
              <Stack.Screen name="(tabs)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
              <Stack.Screen name="modal" options={{ presentation: 'modal', title: 'Modal' }} />
            </Stack>
            <StatusBar style="auto" />
  +       </ClerkProvider>
        </ThemeProvider>
      )
    }
  ```

  ## Configure the token cache

  Clerk stores the active user's session token in memory by default. In Expo apps, the recommended way to store sensitive data, such as tokens, is by using `expo-secure-store` which encrypts the data before storing it.

  To use `expo-secure-store` as your token cache:

  1. Run the following command to install the library:

     ```npm
     npm install expo-secure-store
     ```

  1. Update your root layout to use the secure token cache:
     ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/_layout.tsx' }}
       import { useColorScheme } from '@/hooks/use-color-scheme'
       import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'
     + import { tokenCache } from '@clerk/clerk-expo/token-cache'
       import { DarkTheme, DefaultTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@react-navigation/native'
       import { Stack } from 'expo-router'
       import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar'
       import 'react-native-reanimated'

       export const unstable_settings = {
         anchor: '(tabs)',
       }

       export default function RootLayout() {
         const colorScheme = useColorScheme()

         return (
           <ThemeProvider value={colorScheme === 'dark' ? DarkTheme : DefaultTheme}>
     +       <ClerkProvider tokenCache={tokenCache}>
               <Stack>
                 <Stack.Screen name="(tabs)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
                 <Stack.Screen name="modal" options={{ presentation: 'modal', title: 'Modal' }} />
               </Stack>
               <StatusBar style="auto" />
             </ClerkProvider>
           </ThemeProvider>
         )
       }
     ```

  > [!TIP]
  > When you sign a user out with [`signOut()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-auth#returns), Clerk will remove the user's session JWT from the token cache.

  ## Add sign-up and sign-in pages

  Clerk currently only supports [control components](/docs/reference/components/overview#control-components) for Expo native. UI components are only available for Expo web. Instead, you must build [custom flows](!custom-flow) using Clerk's API. The following sections demonstrate how to build [custom email/password sign-up and sign-in flows](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-password). If you want to use different authentication methods, such as passwordless or OAuth, see the dedicated custom flow guides.

  ### Layout page

  First, protect your sign-up and sign-in pages.

  1. Create an `(auth)` [route group](https://docs.expo.dev/router/advanced/shared-routes/). This will group your sign-up and sign-in pages.
  1. In the `(auth)` group, create a `_layout.tsx` file with the following code. The [`useAuth()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-auth) hook is used to access the user's authentication state. If the user is already signed in, they will be redirected to the home page.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/(auth)/_layout.tsx' }}
  import { Redirect, Stack } from 'expo-router'
  import { useAuth } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'

  export default function AuthRoutesLayout() {
    const { isSignedIn } = useAuth()

    if (isSignedIn) {
      return <Redirect href={'/'} />
    }

    return <Stack />
  }
  ```

  ### Sign-up page

  <Include src="_partials/expo/email-pass-sign-up" />

  ### Sign-in page

  <Include src="_partials/expo/email-pass-sign-in" />

  For more information about building these [custom flows](!custom-flow), including guided comments in the code examples, see the [Build a custom email/password authentication flow](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/authentication/email-password) guide.

  ## Add a sign-out button

  At this point, your users can sign up or in, but they need a way to sign out.

  In the `app/components/` folder, create a `sign-out-button.tsx` file with the following code. The [`useClerk()`](/docs/reference/hooks/use-clerk) hook is used to access the `signOut()` function, which is called when the user clicks the "Sign out" button.

  <Include src="_partials/expo/sign-out-custom-flow" />

  ## Add a home screen

  You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/reference/components/overview#control-components). For this quickstart, you'll use:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.

  To get started:

  1. Create a `(home)` route group.
  1. In the `(home)` group, create a `_layout.tsx` file with the following code.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/(home)/_layout.tsx' }}
  import { Stack } from 'expo-router/stack'

  export default function Layout() {
    return <Stack />
  }
  ```

  Then, in the same folder, create an `index.tsx` file with the following code. If the user is signed in, it displays their email and the sign-out button you created in the previous step. If they're not signed in, it displays sign-in and sign-up links.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/(home)/index.tsx' }}
  import { SignOutButton } from '@/components/sign-out-button'
  import { ThemedText } from '@/components/themed-text'
  import { ThemedView } from '@/components/themed-view'
  import { SignedIn, SignedOut, useSession, useUser } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'
  import { Link } from 'expo-router'
  import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

  export default function Page() {
    const { user } = useUser()

    // If your user isn't appearing as signed in,
    // it's possible they have session tasks to complete.
    // Learn more: https://clerk.com/docs/guides/configure/session-tasks
    const { session } = useSession()
    console.log(session?.currentTask)

    return (
<<<<<<< HEAD
      <View>
=======
      <ThemedView style={styles.container}>
        <ThemedText type="title">Welcome!</ThemedText>
>>>>>>> main
        {/* Show the sign-in and sign-up buttons when the user is signed out */}
        <SignedOut>
          <Link href="/(auth)/sign-in">
            <ThemedText>Sign in</ThemedText>
          </Link>
          <Link href="/(auth)/sign-up">
            <ThemedText>Sign up</ThemedText>
          </Link>
        </SignedOut>
        {/* Show the sign-out button when the user is signed in */}
        <SignedIn>
<<<<<<< HEAD
          <Text>Hello {user?.emailAddresses[0].emailAddress}</Text>
          <SignOutButton />
        </SignedIn>
      </View>
=======
          <ThemedText>Hello {user?.emailAddresses[0].emailAddress}</ThemedText>
          <SignOutButton />
        </SignedIn>
      </ThemedView>
>>>>>>> main
    )
  }

  const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    container: {
      flex: 1,
      padding: 20,
      gap: 16,
    },
  })
  ```

  ## Add the new routes to your stack

  In `app/_layout.tsx`, add the `(auth)` and `(home)` routes to the `<Stack />` so that they're accessible.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/_layout.tsx' }}
    import { useColorScheme } from '@/hooks/use-color-scheme'
    import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-expo'
    import { tokenCache } from '@clerk/clerk-expo/token-cache'
    import { DarkTheme, DefaultTheme, ThemeProvider } from '@react-navigation/native'
    import { Stack } from 'expo-router'
    import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar'
    import 'react-native-reanimated'

    export const unstable_settings = {
      anchor: '(tabs)',
    }

    export default function RootLayout() {
      const colorScheme = useColorScheme()

      return (
        <ThemeProvider value={colorScheme === 'dark' ? DarkTheme : DefaultTheme}>
          <ClerkProvider tokenCache={tokenCache}>
            <Stack>
  +           <Stack.Screen name="(home)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
  +           <Stack.Screen name="(auth)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
              <Stack.Screen name="(tabs)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
              <Stack.Screen name="modal" options={{ presentation: 'modal', title: 'Modal' }} />
            </Stack>
            <StatusBar style="auto" />
          </ClerkProvider>
        </ThemeProvider>
      )
    }
  ```

  ## Run your project

  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm start
  ```

  ## Run your project

<<<<<<< HEAD
  Run your project with the following command:

  ```npm
  npm start
  ```

  ## Create your first user

=======
>>>>>>> main
  1. Visit your app's homepage at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).
  1. Select "Sign up" on the page and authenticate to create your first user.
</Steps>

## Enable OTA updates

Though not required, it is recommended to implement over-the-air (OTA) updates in your Expo app. This enables you to easily roll out Clerk's feature updates and security patches as they're released without having to resubmit your app to mobile marketplaces.

See the [`expo-updates`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/updates) library to learn how to get started.
