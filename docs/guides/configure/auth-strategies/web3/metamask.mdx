Enabling [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) as a Web3 provider allows your users to sign in and  up to your Clerk application with their MetaMask wallet.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MetaMask authentication is not supported when using the **Clerk Chrome Extension SDK**, as it cannot load third-party code per Chrome Web Store policies.

## Enable MetaMask as a Web3 provider

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Web3**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/web3) page.
1. From the list of web3 providers, enable **MetaMask**.
1. Download the [Metamask plugin](https://metamask.io/download/) and install it on your browser to ensure a seamless login flow.

## Test authentication

The simplest way to test authentication is to visit your Clerk application's [Account Portal](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/account-portal), which is available for all Clerk applications out-of-the-box.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/account-portal) page.
1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:
   - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
   - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
1. On the sign-in page, you should see **MetaMask** as an option. Use it to sign in.

## Collect additional user information during sign-up (optional)

Web3 applications typically use a hexadecimal wallet address to identify users, which offers a high level of privacy. However, when bridging the gap between Web3 and Web2, it's often necessary to gather human-readable information about the user, such as their email address, phone number, or a username.

To collect additional information about your user during sign-up:

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**User & authentication**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/user-authentication/user-and-authentication) page.
1. On this page, enable the attributes you want to collect from your user during sign-up.

## Connect MetaMask to existing account

Users can connect their MetaMask Wallet to their account at any time through their user profile page. You can configure your application to use the [Account Portal user profile page](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/account-portal#user-profile) or the prebuilt [`<UserProfile />`](/docs/reference/components/user/user-profile) component.
