How to set up social connection with Microsoft Azure Active Directory

## Overview

Adding social connection with Microsoft Azure to your app with Clerk only requires populating the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client Secret using your Microsoft Azure account.

## Before you start

- You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/). For more information, check out our [Set up your application guide](/get-started/setup-clerk).
- You need to have a Microsoft Azure account, you can sign up for one [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

## Limitations

- Currently Clerk supports only the `common` tenant type, which is intended for allowing sign-ins both from organization members and public Microsoft users.
- Only credentials of type `secret` are currently supported (not the `certificate` type).

Selecting the desired tenant type (`common`, `organizations`, `consumers` or specific tenant ID) will become available in an upcoming version of Clerk.

## Configuring Microsoft Social connection

After creating a Microsoft Azure account, you will need to create a new App Registration.

To do so, navigate to the list of applications and click on New Registration.

In the new application form, make sure you fill in the following fields:

After creating a new app, you will be presented with the app information page.

The **Application (client) ID** visible on this page should be pasted into the **Client ID** form field on the Clerk end.

To generate a value, click on the **Client credentials** link:

Link to set up Client credentials

Microsoft Azure supports 2 kinds of credentials:

1. Client secrets (as the majority of oauth providers)
2. Certificates

At the time of writing, Clerk supports only Client secrets.

To create a new client secret, click on the New client secret button as illustrated below:

![Certificates & secrets screen](/docs/images/authentication-providers/microsoft/c38a13ba0630dd41a950b75a51f025a34cd9fbea-3360x1782.png)

You will be prompted to provide a name & lifetime for the new secret.

After confirming your choicem the new secret will be listed. This is the only time you will able to copy & paste it, so make sure you do so before navigating away. Also, take note of the lifetime of said secret because you will need to generate a new one before it expires.

The newly generated secret can now be pasted in the **Client Secret** input on the Clerk end.

Finally, you'll need to instruct your Microsoft Azure app to operate in OpenID  mode so that it provides clerk with an **id_token** when the sign-in completes. This allows Clerk to populate data about the user from their Microsoft profile.

This can be done by navigating to the Authentication section and checking the option displayed below:

That's it! You are now ready to allow your users to sign in using Microsoft Azure!

Stay tuned for updates as Clerk integrates support for more Microsoft social connection options.
