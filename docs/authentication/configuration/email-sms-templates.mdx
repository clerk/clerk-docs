description: Learn how to configure the theming of Clerk-sent emails and SMS messages.
---

Clerk provides a templating system that allows you to customize the default system email and SMS messages sent during authentication flows.

The template editor enables you to change the wording and styling so that it is more consistent with your own branding.

It is also a useful way to translate the content to another target language in the case that English is not the default locale of your application.

## Before you start

### Terminology

It will be useful to take a look at the following terms as they will reappear in the rest of the guide:

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| variables | Also known as merge tags in the context of email marketing, these are placeholders that are replaced with dynamic data when the actual email or SMS is being sent to the recipient. |
| WYSIWYG | Stands for 'What You See Is What You Get.' This term is used for editors and design tools that allow you to create content or layouts in a visual manner (without requiring you to edit the underlying markup) so that you can instantly see how the result is going to display to your users. |
| blocks | Email WYSIWYG editors enable you to use blocks, rows, and columns in order to control the layout of their content. This is then transpiled to table-based HTML. |

### Revolvapp WYSIWYG email editor plugin

The email editor uses the [Revolvapp](https://imperavi.com/redactor/legacy/revolvapp) email template editor plugin by Imperavi. To acquaint yourself with the template markup syntax, please consult the corresponding [documentation page](https://imperavi.com/redactor/legacy/revolvapp/docs/syntax/quick-start).

As you will see, the template markup is an HTML-like language and each type of node supports its own set of attributes which control its behavior. A lot of the attributes are borrowed from HTML itself.

Revolvapp allows the user to design the template using [blocks](#terminology) and under the hood transpiles its markup to table-based HTML so that the resulting email renders consistently across email clients.

### Handlebars templating language

Both the email and SMS editor use the [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templating language for the interpolation of dynamic values into your content via [variables](#terminology). Variables are wrapped in double curly braces. For example: `{{app.name}}`. When the message is to be sent, the variable will be replaced with the actual value, which in this example would be the name of the application.

When editing a template in the Clerk Dashboard, you can insert variables at the desired position, so there is no need to write them by hand. Though, you can still do so if you like.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to unescape special characters, you may need to wrap variables in triple curly braces. For example: `{{{app.name}}}`. This will allow special characters (e.g. `'`, `&`) to appear as displayed and not as escaped HTML entities (e.g. `&apos;`, `&amp;`).

## Edit email templates

To access the email templates:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=customization/email).
1. In the navigation sidebar, select **Customization > Emails**.
1. Select a template to edit.
1. Once you have selected a template, you will be presented with [template operations](#template-operations), the [template settings](#email-template-settings), and [the WYSIWYG editor](#email-wysiwyg-editor).

### Template operations

The following operations are available for an email template:

- **Preview**: enables you to get an idea of how the template will render when sent to the recipient. This is useful for sampling your changes without actually having to commit them first. The `app_logo` and `copyright` sections (if present) will be replaced with their actual markup in this view.
- **Copy**: copies the current state of the editor to another instance. This is especially useful for promoting changes from your development or staging environment to production after you have tested them. **The copy icon will not appear if there are no other instances available on your application.**
- **Revert**: reverts to the system default template version. This can be useful if you want to start over from scratch.
- **Reset**: undo all changes since the last save by selecting the **Reset** button at the bottom right of the dashboard.

### Email template settings

The following settings can be changed per email template:

- **Delivered by Clerk**: out of the box, Clerk will deliver your emails using its own Email Service Provider (ESP), which is currently [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/). However, if you wish to handle delivery of emails on your own, then you can toggle this setting off. This means that Clerk will no longer be sending this particular email and in order to deliver it yourself, you will need to listen to the `emails.created` [webhook](/docs/integrations/webhooks/overview) and extract the necessary info from the event payload.
- **Name**: a name for the template on the template listing page. It does not affect the outgoing email in any way.
- **From**: the email address that will be used as the **From** address in the email header. The format is `<local part>@<your-domain>`. You can change the local part to a custom value. If no value is provided, it defaults `noreply`.
- **Reply-To**: the email address that will be used as the **Reply-To** address in the email header. This is useful if you want to direct replies to a different email address than the one used in the **From** field. The format is `<local part>@<your-domain>`. You can change the local part to a custom value. If no value is provided, the **Reply-To** header will be omitted.
- **Subject**: the subject line of the email.

### Email WYSIWYG editor

The email WYSIWYG editor is split into two parts:

- [The toolbar](#toolbar-controls)
- [The text area](#text-area-controls)

#### Toolbar controls

The toolbar is located at the top of the editor and contains the following controls, in order from left to right:

- **Shortcut** button
- **Mobile view** toggle
- **HTML mode** toggle - For this tool to appear, you will need to unselect any currently selected block.
- **Background** button
- **Settings** button

For the following controls to appear, you will need to select an existing [block](#terminology) in the text area. These controls will not be visible otherwise.

- **Add block** button
- **Alignment** button
- **Link** button
- **Text color** button
- **Variable** button
- **Border** button

#### Text area controls

The email WYSIWYG editor text area is intended mainly for authoring content. Though, if you select a [block](#terminology), a set of tools will also appear. In order from top to bottom, these are:

- **Move handle**
- **Delete**
- **Clone**

## Edit SMS templates

To access the SMS templates:

1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=customization/sms).
1. In the navigation sidebar, select **Customization > SMS**.
1. Select a template to edit. You can also disable certain SMS notifications.
1. A modal will appear that shows you what the template looks like, plus options to toggle the [**Delivered by Clerk**](#delivered-by-clerk) setting or to [request a change to the template](#request-change).

### Delivered by Clerk

Out of the box, Clerk will deliver your SMS messages using its own SMS Gateway. However, if you wish to handle SMS delivery on your own, then you can toggle **Delivered by Clerk** off.

This means that Clerk will no longer be sending this particular SMS and in order to deliver it yourself, you will need to listen to the `sms.created` [webhook](/docs/integrations/webhooks/overview) and extract the necessary info from the event payload.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember, this is a per-template setting and will not be applied to other templates.

### Request change

Modifications to an SMS template are subject to approval by Clerk support. Once you submit the desired copywriting for a particular SMS template, a draft will be created for Clerk support to review.

If the change conforms to Clerk content policy, a support agent will approve your draft, and it will become effective from that point on. If the change is rejected, then the draft will be canceled.

You can also cancel a draft yourself if you decide you no longer need the changes or if you wish to submit a new draft.

The following settings can be changed for an SMS template:

- **Name**: a name for the template on the template listing page. It does not affect the outgoing email in any way.
- **Message**: a text area where you can author the content of the SMS message. The SMS content should fit within a limit of 160 simple GSM-7 or 140 unicode characters. To insert a [variable](#terminology) at the current cursor position, select the corresponding variable badge. You can interpolate a particular metadata key by using the following syntax: `{{user.metadata.foo.bar}}`.
