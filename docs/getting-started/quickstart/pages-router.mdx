<Steps>
  ## Install `@clerk/nextjs`

  The [Clerk Next.js SDK](/docs/reference/nextjs/overview) gives you access to prebuilt components, React hooks, and helpers to make user authentication easier.

  Run the following command to install the SDK:

  ```npm
  npm install @clerk/nextjs
  ```

  ## Set your Clerk API keys

  <SignedIn>
    Add the following keys to your `.env` file. These keys can always be retrieved from the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys) page in the Clerk Dashboard.
  </SignedIn>

  <SignedOut>
    1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**API keys**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/api-keys){{ track: 'exp_create_account_nextjs_quickstart' }} page.
    1. In the **Quick Copy** section, copy your Clerk Publishable and Secret Keys.
    1. Paste your keys into your `.env` file.

    The final result should resemble the following:
  </SignedOut>

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY={{pub_key}}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY={{secret}}
  ```

  ## Add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app

  [`clerkMiddleware()`](/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware) grants you access to user authentication state throughout your app, on any route or page. It also allows you to protect specific routes from unauthenticated users. To add `clerkMiddleware()` to your app, follow these steps:

  <Include src="_partials/nextjs/nextjs-15-callout" />

  1. Create a `proxy.ts` file.
     - If you're using the `/src` directory, create `proxy.ts` in the `/src` directory.
     - If you're not using the `/src` directory, create `proxy.ts` in the root directory alongside `.env`.
  1. In your `proxy.ts` file, export the `clerkMiddleware()` helper:

     ```tsx {{ filename: 'proxy.ts' }}
     import { clerkMiddleware } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

     export default clerkMiddleware()

     export const config = {
       matcher: [
         // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
         '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
         // Always run for API routes
         '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
       ],
     }
     ```
  1. By default, `clerkMiddleware()` will not protect any routes. All routes are public and you must opt-in to protection for routes. See the [`clerkMiddleware()` reference](/docs/reference/nextjs/clerk-middleware) to learn how to require authentication for specific routes.

  ## Add `<ClerkProvider>` and Clerk components to your app

  <Include src="_partials/clerk-provider/explanation" />

  You can control which content signed-in and signed-out users can see with Clerk's [prebuilt control components](/docs/reference/components/overview#control-components). Create a header using the following components:

  - [`<SignedIn>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-in): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed in**.
  - [`<SignedOut>`](/docs/reference/components/control/signed-out): Children of this component can only be seen while **signed out**.
  - [`<UserButton />`](/docs/reference/components/user/user-button): Shows the signed-in user's avatar. Selecting it opens a dropdown menu with account management options.
  - [`<SignInButton />`](/docs/reference/components/unstyled/sign-in-button): An unstyled component that links to the sign-in page. In this example, since no props or [environment variables](/docs/guides/development/clerk-environment-variables) are set for the sign-in URL, this component links to the [Account Portal sign-in page](/docs/guides/customizing-clerk/account-portal#sign-in).

    ```tsx {{ filename: 'pages/_app.tsx', mark: [2, [7, 18], 20] }}
    import '@/styles/globals.css'
    import { ClerkProvider, SignInButton, SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from '@clerk/nextjs'
    import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

    function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
      return (
        <ClerkProvider
          {...pageProps}
          appearance={{
            cssLayerName: 'clerk',
          }}
        >
          <SignedOut>
            <SignInButton />
          </SignedOut>
          <SignedIn>
            <UserButton />
          </SignedIn>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </ClerkProvider>
      )
    }

    export default MyApp
    ```

  ## Update `globals.css`

  <Include src="_partials/nextjs/update-globals-css" />

  ## Create your first user

  <Include src="_partials/nextjs/create-first-user" />
