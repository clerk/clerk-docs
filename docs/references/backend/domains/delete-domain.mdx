title: '`deleteDomain()`'
description: Use Clerk's Backend SDK to delete a satellite domain for the instance.
---

Deletes a satellite domain for the instance. It is currently not possible to delete the instance's primary domain. Returns a [`DeletedObject`](/docs/references/javascript/types/deleted-object).

```ts
function deleteDomain(id: string): Promise<DeletedObject>
```

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `id`
  - `string`

  The ID of the domain that will be deleted. Must be a satellite domain.
</Properties>

## Example

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

```tsx
const id = 'test_123'

const response = await clerkClient.users.deleteDomain(id)
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `DELETE/domains/{domain_id}`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Domains#operation/DeleteDomain){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
