## `getOrganizationMembershipList()` examples

### `getOrganizationMembershipList({ organizationId })`

In this example, you can see that the returned [`PaginatedResourceResponse`](/docs/references/backend/types/paginated-resource-response) includes `data`, which is an array of [`OrganizationMembership`](/docs/references/javascript/organization-membership) objects, and `totalCount`, which indicates the total number of organization memberships in the system for the specified organization.

```tsx
const organizationId = 'org_2ZUtbk2yvnFGItdeze1ivCh3uqh';

const response = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationMembershipList({ organizationId });

console.log(response);
/* In this example, you can see that data is an array of OrganizationMembership objects, and is populated with two OrganizationMemberships.
{
  data: [
    _OrganizationMembership {
      id: 'orgmem_2b6TUmlDXlo3e9XPq3Wd9EyfIfj',
      role: 'org:member',
      publicMetadata: {},
      privateMetadata: {},
      createdAt: 1705534546701,
      updatedAt: 1705534546701,
      organization: [_Organization],
      publicUserData: [_OrganizationMembershipPublicUserData]
    },
    _OrganizationMembership {
      id: 'orgmem_2ZUtbeklm2DPSy7jsaLLwf6V8Nq',
      role: 'org:admin',
      publicMetadata: {},
      privateMetadata: {},
      createdAt: 1702488558867,
      updatedAt: 1702488558867,
      organization: [_Organization],
      publicUserData: [_OrganizationMembershipPublicUserData]
    }
  ],
  totalCount: 2
}
*/
```

### `getOrganizationMembershipList({ organizationId, limit })`

Retrieves organization membership list that is filtered by the number of results.

```tsx
const organizationId = 'org_123';

const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationMembershipList({
  organizationId,
  // returns the first 10 memberships
  limit: 10,
});
```

### `getOrganizationMembershipList({ organizationId, offset })`

Retrieves organizaiton membership list that is filtered by the number of results to skip.

```tsx
const organizationId = 'org_123';

const { data, totalCount } = await clerkClient.organizations.getOrganizationMembershipList({
  organizationId,
  // skips the first 10 memberships
  offset: 10,
});
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `GET/organizations/{organization_id}/memberships`. See the [BAPI reference](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organization-Memberships#operation/ListOrganizationMemberships) for more details.
