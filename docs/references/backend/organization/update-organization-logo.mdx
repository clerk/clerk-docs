description: Use Clerk's Backend SDK to update an organization's logo.
---

{/* clerk/javascript file: https://github.com/clerk/javascript/blob/main/packages/backend/src/api/endpoints/OrganizationApi.ts#L136 */}

Updates the organization's logo. Returns an [`Organization`](/docs/references/backend/types/backend-organization) object.

```ts
function updateOrganizationLogo(
  organizationId: string,
  params: UpdateLogoParams,
): Promise<Organization>
```

## `UpdateLogoParams`

<Properties>
  - `file`
  - `Blob | File`

  The file to upload as the organization's logo.

  ---

  - `uploaderUserId?`
  - `string`

  The ID of the user uploading the logo.
</Properties>

## Example

<Include src="_partials/backend/usage" />

> [!WARNING]
> Using Backend SDK methods can contribute towards rate limiting. To set an organization's logo, it's recommended to use the frontend [`organization.setLogo()`](/docs/references/javascript/organization#set-logo) method instead.

```tsx
const organizationId = 'org_123'
const uploaderUserId = 'user_123'

const fileBits = ['logo-pic-content']
const fileName = 'logo.png'
const file = new File(fileBits, fileName, { type: 'image/png' })

const params = {
  file,
  uploaderUserId,
}

const response = await clerkClient.organizations.updateOrganizationLogo(organizationId, params)
```

## Backend API (BAPI) endpoint

This method in the SDK is a wrapper around the BAPI endpoint `PUT/organizations/{organization_id}/logo`. See the [BAPI reference](/docs/reference/backend-api/tag/Organizations#operation/UploadOrganizationLogo){{ target: '_blank' }} for more information.
