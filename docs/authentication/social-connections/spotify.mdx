  - Use Spotify to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [**Spotify**](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Spotify account.

> [!CAUTION]
> [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes) requires users to be added to the Spotify application's allowlist to connect to your Clerk application via Spotify OAuth. Each user attempting to use your Clerk application in **development** with Spotify as their authentication method must be added to the allowlist before gaining access.
>
> Although users may be able to log into your **development** Clerk application without being allowlisted in Spotify, any API requests made with an access token associated with that user and the Spotify application will receive a 403 status code.

To make the setup process easier, we recommend keeping two browser tabs open: one for your [**Clerk Dashboard**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [**Spotify Developer Dashboard**](https://developer.spotify.com/).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Spotify as a social connection in Clerk

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
  1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
  1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Spotify**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Authorized redirect URI** somewhere secure.
  1. Keep the modal and page open throughout the guide.

  ### Create your application in Spotify

  1. On a separate page, go to the [**Spotify Developer Dashboard**](https://developer.spotify.com/) and sign in to create a new Spotify application.
  1. In the top-right navigation, select your profile button and select [**Dashboard**](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
  1. Select [**Create app**](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/create).
  1. After being redirected to the application creation form, complete the fields for **App name** and **App description**. For **Redirect URIs**, paste the URL you copied from the Spotify modal in your **Clerk Dashboard**.
  1. Select **Settings**. 
  1. Keep this page open.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  1. In the Spotify application's settings page, scroll to the bottom and select **Edit**.
  1. Scroll back to the top of the page and copy the **Client ID**.
  1. Navigate back to your **Clerk Dashboard**. In the **Add connection for all users** modal under the **Configure Spotify** section, paste the string in **Client ID**.
  1. Navigate back to the **Spotify Developer Dashboard**. Select the **View client secret** link and copy the string.
  1. Paste the string in **Client Secret** and select **Add connection**. Once the settings are saved, you should see a green **`Used for sign-in`** label next to Spotify in the **Provider** list.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth setup is by visiting your Clerk application's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available out-of-the-box for all Clerk applications.

  1. In the navigation sidebar of your **Clerk Dashboard**, select [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal).
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:
     - **For development**: `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
     - **For production**: `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`
  1. On the sign-in page, you should see **Spotify** as an option. Use it to sign in with your Spotify account.
