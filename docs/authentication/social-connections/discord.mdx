  - Use Discord to authenticate users with OAuth
</TutorialHero>

Enabling OAuth with [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Discord account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Discord**.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials, which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your Discord account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Discord as a social connection in Clerk

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For all users**.
  1. In the **Choose provider** dropdown, select **Discord**.
  1. Ensure that both **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials** are toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep the modal and page open.

  ### Create a Discord Developer app

  1. On a separate page, go to the [Discord Developers Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and sign in.
  1. In the top-right, select **New Application**.
  1. Complete the required fields and select **Create**. You'll be redirected to the **General Information** page.
  1. In the sidebar, select **OAuth2**.
  1. Under **Redirects**, select **Add Redirect**. Paste the **Redirect URI** you saved from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Select **Save Changes**. You may need to tap anywhere on the screen for the button to show. Keep this page open.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  1. In your Discord Developers Portal, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. If you don't see the **Copy** button under the **Client Secret**, select **Reset Secret** to generate a new one.
  1. Navigate back to your Clerk Dashboard where the modal should still be open and paste these values into the respective fields.
  1. Select **Add connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the modal or page is not still open, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page in the Clerk Dashboard. Select the **Discord** connection. Under **Use custom credentials**, you can paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into their respective fields.

  ### Test your OAuth

  The simplest way to test your OAuth is to visit your Clerk app's [Account Portal](/docs/customization/account-portal/overview), which is available for all Clerk apps out-of-the-box.

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**Account Portal**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=account-portal) page.
  1. Next to the **Sign-in** URL, select **Visit**. The URL should resemble:

  - **For development** – `https://your-domain.accounts.dev/sign-in`
  - **For production** – `https://accounts.your-domain.com/sign-in`

  1. Sign in with your Discord account.
