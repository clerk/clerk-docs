# Email Verification

These are all methods on [the `SignUp` class](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) that allow you to verify a user's sign-up request via email.

## `prepareEmailAddressVerification()`

```typescript
function prepareEmailAddressVerification(params?: PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<SignUp>;
```

Helper method that allows you to initiate a verification process for an email address. It basically sends a one-time code to the email address already supplied to the current sign up.

The defaults of this method are equivalent to calling [`SignUp.prepareVerification("email_code")`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/verification#prepareverification).

### `PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams`

<Tables
  headings={["Name", "Type", "Description"]}
  headingsMeta={[{}, {maxWidth: "300px"}, {maxWidth: "300px"}]}
  rows={[
 {cells: [
      <code>strategy</code>,
      <code>string</code>,
      <>
      The verification strategy to validate the user's sign-up request. The following strategies are supported:
      <ul>
        <li><strong><code>email_code</code></strong>: Send an email with a unique token to input.</li>
        <li><strong><code>email_link</code></strong>: Send an email with a link which validates sign-up</li>
      </ul>
      </>
 ]},
 {cells: [
    <code>redirectUrl</code>,
    <code>string</code>,
    <>
    The URL to redirect the user to after the verification process is complete. <strong>Only supported on <code>email_link</code>, <code>oauth_*</code>, and <code>saml</code> strategies</strong>.
    </>
 ]}
  ]}
/>



## `attemptEmailAddressVerification()`

```typescript
function attemptEmailAddressVerification(params: AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<SignUp>;
```

Helper method that attempts to complete the verification process for an email address. It basically verifies that the supplied code is the same as the one-time code that was sent to the email address during the prepare verification phase.

This is equivalent to calling [`SignUp.attemptVerification({strategy: "email_code", ...params})`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/verification#attemptverification).

### `AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams`

<Tables
  headings={["Name", "Type", "Description"]}
  headingsMeta={[{}, {maxWidth: "300px"}, {maxWidth: "300px"}]}
  rows={[
 {
    cells: [
        <code>code</code>,
        <code>string</code>,
        <>
        The code that was sent to the user via email.
        </>
        ]
 }
  ]}
/>
