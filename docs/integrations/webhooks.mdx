# Webhooks

Clerk webhooks allow you to receive event notifications from Clerk. Clerk will send a POST request to a URL you specify when certain events happen in your Clerk account.

## Payload structure

The payload of the message includes the type of the event in the type property.

The `data` property contains the actual payload sent by Clerk. The payload can be a different object depending on the `event` type. For example, for `user.*` events, the payload will always be the User object . For `organization.*` event type, the payload will always be an organization (except for when it is deleted).

Below is an example of a webhook payload for a `user.created` event:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "birthday": "",
    "created_at": 1654012591514,
    "email_addresses": [
      {

        "linked_to": [],
        "object": "email_address",

}
```

## Typescript Support

Clerk provides the types as part of our SDK offering, below is an example of type usage in a webhook handler:

```tsx
import type { WebhookEvent } from "@clerk/clerk-sdk-node"

const handler = req => {
  const evt = req.body.evt as WebhookEvent;
  switch (evt.type) {
    case 'user.created':
      // UserJSON.first_name is a string
      const firstName = evt.data.first_name
      // UserJSON.last_name is a string
      const lastName = evt.data.last_name
      // UserJSON.email_addresses is an array of EmailAddressJSON
      const emails = evt.data.email_addresses;
  }
}
```
