> [!WARNING]
> When using `has()` **on the server-side** to check permissions, it only works with **custom permissions**, as [system permissions](/docs/organizations/roles-permissions#system-permissions) are not included in `auth.sessionClaims.orgs_permissions`. To check system permissions, verify the user's role instead.
