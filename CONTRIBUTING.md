# Contributing to Clerk's documentation

Thanks for being willing to contribute to [Clerk's documentation](https://clerk.com/docs)! This document outlines how to effectively contribute updates and fixes to the documentation content located in this repository.

## Written in MDX

Clerk's documentation content is written in a variation of markdown called [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). MDX allows us to embed React components in the content, unlocking rich, interactive documentation experiences. Clerk's documentation site also supports [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), adding support for things like tables and task lists.

We are still working on migrating some pages from our CMS to this repository, so you may notice some pages only have:
```
---
sanity_slug:
---
```
These pages will be updated when they are migrated to MDX. Until then, if you would like to request an edit, please create an issue and we will make sure to incorporate your feedback.

## Project setup

1.  Fork and clone the repo
2.  Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
3.  Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b pr/your-branch-name`

> Tip: Keep your `main` branch pointing at the original repository and make pull
> requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
>     git remote add upstream https://github.com/clerkinc/clerk-docs.git
>     git fetch upstream
>     git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main main
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `main` branch
> to use the upstream main branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you can make
> all of your pull request branches based on this `main` branch. Whenever you
> want to update your version of `main`, do a regular `git pull`.

## Creating an issue

If you have found a contribution you would like to make, but it is rather large, it is recommended to open an [issue](https://github.com/clerkinc/clerk-docs/issues) first. Doing so not only helps keep track of what you plan to work on, but also facilitates discussions with maintainers, who can provide valuable feedback and ideas even before you begin implementing changes.

Modifications such as correcting misspelled words, addressing grammatical or punctuation errors, or making similar minor adjustments probably don't require the creation of an issue. In such cases, you are welcome to proceed by creating a pull request.

The structure of the issue should be:

- **Title**: Summarize the problem you want to solve in one sentence, using an active voice. E.g. "Fix broken "Home" link on sidenav"
- **Description ("Leave a comment")**: Discuss what your finding is, why it needs a solution, and where you found it/how it can be reproduced. Links, screenshots, and videos can be helpful tools!

## Creating a Pull Request

When you're ready to submit your contribution, you're going to create a [pull request](https://github.com/clerkinc/clerk-docs/pulls), also referred to as a PR.

If this is your first time, or you need a refresher on how to create a PR, you can check out this video:

[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub}](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

The structure of the PR should be:

- **Title**: Summarize the change you made, using an active voice. E.g. "Fix broken "Home" link on sidenav"
  - If there is an issue that this PR is meant to resolve, the titles will probably be the same.
- **Description ("Leave a comment")**: Describe what the concern was and summarize how you solved it.

## Previewing your changes

If you use VSCode, consider using [the built-in markdown preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) to see what the rendered content will look like. *Note that this will not include custom components or styles.*

> **Note**
> A member of the Clerk team can add the `deploy-preview` label to your pull request, which will trigger a preview deployment with your changes.

## Validating your changes

Before committing your changes, run our linting checks to validate the changes you are making are correct. Currently we:

* Check for broken links

```
npm run lint
```

## Getting your contributions reviewed

Once you open up a pull request with your changes, a member of the Clerk team will review your pull request and approve it, or leave addressable feedback. We do our best to review all contributions in a timely manner, but please be patient if someone does not take a look at it right away.

Once your pull request is approved, a member of the Clerk team will merge it and make sure it gets deployed! 🚀

## Deployment

The content rendered on https://clerk.com/docs is pulled from the `main` branch in this repository. If your PR is merged to the `main` branch, a workflow is triggered that updates the production pages. Changes should be reflected on https://clerk.com/docs within a matter of seconds.

## Repository structure

The documentation content is located in the [`/docs` directory](./docs/). Each MDX file located in this directory will be rendered under https://clerk.com/docs at its path relative to the root `/docs` directory, without the file extension.

For example, the file at `/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk.mdx` can be found at https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/setup-clerk.

### Navigation manifest

The navigation element rendered on https://clerk.com/docs is powered by the manifest file at [`/docs/manifest.json`](./docs/manifest.json). Making changes to this data structure will update the rendered navigation.

#### Navigation constructs

The navigation is built from a small number of primitive constructs:

- **Link** (`["Title", "/path/to/page"]`) - Renders a link. The path should be a full path relative to the documentation root (`https://clerk.com/docs/`)
- **Separator** (`"---"`) - Renders a visual separator for grouping
- **Heading** (`"# Heading"`) - Renders a heading
- **Section** (`["Title", [elements]]`) - Renders a collapsible section
- **Page** (`[{ title: "Title", root: "/root/path" }, [elements]]`) - Indicates a new navigation page. When viewing a page under the provided `root`, The navigation data associated with the matching navigation page will be rendered
- **Text Config** (`{ title: "Tite", icon: "nextjs", tag: "coming soon" }`) - Can be used in place of a construct's title string to render additional elements

## Editing content

As mentioned above, all of the documentation content is located in the **`/docs`** directory. If you are having trouble finding the file associated with a specific page on the live documentation site, try clicking the "Edit this page on GitHub" link.

### File metadata

Each file has a few required frontmatter fields, which are defined like so:

```mdx
---
title: Page title
description: Some brief, but effective description of the page's content.
---
```

- **`title`** - The title of the page. Used to populate the HTML `<title>` tag
- **`description`** - The description of the page. Used to populate a page's `<meta name="description">` tag

These fields should be preset on every documentation page.

### Headings

Headings should be written in sentence-casing, where only the first word of the heading is capitalized. E.g. "This is a heading"

### Code blocks

Syntax-highlighted code blocks are rendered wherever markdown code blocks are used. To render a highlighted TypeScript snippet, you would do this:

```
​```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  a + b
}
​```
```

You can also specify a filename:

```
​```typescript filename="add.ts"
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  a + b
}
​```
```

#### `<CodeBlockTabs />`

If you need to render multiple variations of a code snippet, use `<CodeBlockTabs />`. The component accepts an `options` property, which is an array of strings. For each option provided, render a code block:

```mdx
<CodeBlockTabs options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>

​```
npm i @clerk/nextjs
​```

​```
yarn add @clerk/nextjs
​```

​```
pnpm add @clerk/nextjs
​```

</CodeBlockTabs>
```

#### `<Tabs />`

If you need to structure content in a tabular format, use the `<Tabs />` component. The component accepts an `items` property, which is an array of strings. For each option provided, render a `<Tab />` component:

```mdx
<Tabs items={["React", "JavaScript"]}>
<Tab>
# React

</Tab>
<Tab>
# JavaScript

</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

### Tables

Tables can be formatted using markdown, like so:

```
| Heading1 | Heading2 |
| --- | --- |
| Cell1A | Cell2A |
| Cell1B | Cell2B |
| `code1` | `code2` |
| [Link1](https://link1.com) | [Link2](https://link2.com)
```

#### `<Tables />`

If you have more complex content that you need inside a table, such as embedding JSX elements, you can use the `<Tables />` component. While you *can* embed JSX elements in a markdown table, embedding JSX elements in a JSX component is the *better* option for formatting and readability purposes.

For example, one of these cells has content that would best formatted in an unordered list.

```
<Tables
  headings={["Name", "Type", "Description"]},
  rows={[
    {
      cells: [
        <code>cell1A</code>,
        <code>cell2A</code>,
        <>This is cell3A which would be filled under the description heading.</>,
      ]
    },
    {
      cells: [
        <code>cell2A</code>,
        <code>cell2B</code>,
        <>This is cell3B, and it renders components:
          <ul>
            <li>listitem1 inside cell3B</li>
            <li>listitem2 inside cell3B</li>
            <li>listitem3 inside cell3B</li>
          </ul>
        </>,
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>
```

### Images and static assets

Images and static assets should be placed in the `public/` folder. To reference an image or asset in content, prefix the path with `/docs`. For example, if an image exists at `public/images/logo.png`, to render it on a page you would use the following: `![Logo](/docs/images/logo.png)`.

When rendering images, make sure that you provide appropriate alternate text. Reference [this decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/) for help picking a suitable value.

> **Note**
> Is the image you're adding optimized? If not, consider running it through an optimizer, like [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/).
