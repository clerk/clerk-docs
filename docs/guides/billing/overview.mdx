## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### Can I use an existing Stripe account with Clerk billing?

Unfortunately, there is no way to use an existing business entity with Clerk billing.

### Can I see subscriptions in my Stripe account?

Clerk billing does not use Stripe products, prices, subscriptions, etc. Clerk manages plans and subscriptions/subscription items, and only uses Stripe for payment processing. You will still be able to see customer information, as well as payment information in your Stripe account.

### Is Clerk a Merchant of Record (MoR) for transactions?

No, Clerk does not provide this service.

### Does Clerk Billing support non-USD currencies?

Clerk Billing currently supports only USD as the billing currency. While you can connect both US and non-US Stripe accounts, all payments will be processed in USD regardless of your Stripe account’s local currency. For information about Stripe’s supported countries and currencies, see [Stripe Global](https://stripe.com/global){{ rel: 'noopener noreferrer' }}. Support for additional currencies is on our roadmap.

### What third-party tools does Clerk Billing integrate with?

None directly, but since payments are processed through Stripe, you can use any third-party tool that integrates with Stripe for analytics, reporting, invoicing, or tax compliance.

### Can I offer custom pricing plans to specific customers?

Clerk Billing does not currently support custom pricing plans, though we plan to roll out support for this in the future.

### Can I let users upgrade or downgrade their plans mid-cycle?

Yes. Plan upgrades will take effect immediately, while downgrades take effect at the end of the current billing cycle.

### Does Clerk Billing support annual subscriptions?

Yes, you can offer subscribers the option to pay annually, at a discounted monthly price. Set up annual pricing for your plans in the Clerk dashboard, and customers can choose between monthly or annual billing when subscribing.

### How does Clerk handle taxes and VAT for international billing?

Clerk Billing does not currently support tax or VAT, but these are planned for future releases.

### How can I test failure scenarios like expired cards or canceled subscriptions?

You can simulate failures in Stripe test mode using test cards that trigger specific behaviors. See [Stripe Testing](https://docs.stripe.com/testing){{ rel: 'noopener noreferrer' }} for a list of test cards and behaviors.

### Which countries is Clerk Billing not supported in?

Clerk Billing is not supported in Brazil, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, and Thailand due to [payment processing restrictions](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses). Support may be added in the future. For all other regions, availability depends on Stripe - see [Stripe Global](https://stripe.com/global){{ rel: 'noopener noreferrer' }} for the full list.
