  - Use Microsoft to authenticate users with EASIE SSO.
</TutorialHero>

Enabling EASIE SSO with Microsoft (formerly [Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/new-name)) allows your users to sign up and sign in to your Clerk application with their Microsoft account.

## Configure for your development instance

For _development instances_, Clerk uses preconfigured shared credentials and redirect URIs—no other configuration is needed.

1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For specific domains**.
1. Under **EASIE**, select **Microsoft** as the identity provider.
1. Add the **Specific Domain** that you want to allow this connection for. This is the domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your app.
1. Select **Add connection**.

## Configure for your production instance

> [!WARNING]
> If you already [configured Microsoft as a social provider](/docs/authentication/social-connections/microsoft), you can skip this step. EASIE SSO will automatically use the credentials you configured for your social connection.

For _production instances_, you must provide custom credentials, which involves generating your own **Client ID** and **Client Secret** using your Microsoft Entra ID account.

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

<Steps>
  ### Enable Microsoft as an EASIE connection

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page.
  1. Select **Add connection** and select **For specific domains**.
  1. Under **EASIE**, select **Microsoft** as the identity provider.
  1. Add the **Specific Domain** that you want to allow this connection for. This is the domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your app.
  1. Ensure that **Use custom credentials** is toggled on.
  1. Save the **Redirect URI** somewhere secure. Keep this page open.

  ### Create a Microsoft Entra ID app

  > [!TIP]
  > If you already have a Microsoft Entra ID app you'd like to connect to Clerk, select your app from the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and skip to [the next step in this tutorial](#get-your-client-id-and-client-secret).

  1. On the homepage of the [Microsoft Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home), in the **Azure services** section, select **[Microsoft Entra ID](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview)**.
  1. In the sidebar, open the **Manage** dropdown and select **[App registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/RegisteredApps)**.
  1. Select **New Registration**. You'll be redirected to the **Register an application** page.
  1. Complete the form as follows:
     1. Under **Name**, enter your app name.
     1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant – Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)**.
     1. Under **Redirect URI (Optional)**, select **Web**.
     1. Select **Register** to submit the form.

  ### Secure your app against the nOAuth vulnerability

  [nOAuth](https://www.descope.com/blog/post/noauth) is an exploit in Microsoft Entra ID OAuth apps that can lead to account takeovers via email address spoofing. Clerk mitigates this risk by enforcing stricter checks on verified email addresses.

  For further security, Microsoft offers an optional `xms_edov` claim, which provides additional context to determine whether the returned email is verified.

  This claim is mandatory for applications backing EASIE connections. To enable it, you must:

  1. In the Microsoft Azure portal, navigate to your app.
  1. In the sidebar, select **Token configuration**.
  1. Select **Add optional claim**.
  1. For the **Token type**, select **ID**. Then, in the table that opens, enable the `email` and `xms_pdl` claims.
  1. At the bottom of the modal, select **Add**. A new modal will prompt you to turn on the Microsoft Graph email permission. Enable it, then select **Add** to complete the form.
     > [!NOTE]
     > At the time of writing, the `xms_edov` claim is still in preview and may not be available for all apps. We'll choose another claim and rename it in the manifest later.
  1. Repeat the previous steps for **Token type**, but select **Access** instead of **ID**. The **Optional claims** list should now show two claims for `email` and two for `xms_pdl`: one each for **ID** and **Access**.
  1. In the sidebar, go to **Manifest**.
  1. In the text editor, search for `"acceptMappedClaims"` and set its value from `null` to `true`.
  1. Search for `"optionalClaims"`, where you'll find the `idToken` and `accessToken` arrays. Each array has an object with the name `xms_pdl`. Change the name to `xms_edov`.
  1. At the top of the page, select **Save**.
  1. In the sidebar, navigate back to **Token configuration** and confirm that the **Optional claims** list includes two claims for `email` and two for `xms_edov`: one each for **ID** and **Access**.

  With these steps complete, Microsoft will send the `xms_edov` claim in the token, which Clerk will use to determine whether the email is verified, even when used with Microsoft Entra ID.

  ### Get your client ID and client secret

  Once your Microsoft Entra ID app is created, or once you select your app from the Microsoft Azure portal, you'll be redirected to its **Overview**.

  1. From your app's overview, save the **Application (client) ID** somewhere secure. You'll need it to connect your Microsoft Entra ID app to your Clerk app.
  1. Under **Client credentials**, select **Add a certificate or secret** to generate a **Client Secret**. You'll be redirected to the **Certificate & secrets** page.
  1. Select **New client secret**. In the modal that opens, enter a description and set an expiration time for your secret.
     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > When your secret expires, your social connection will stop working until you generate a new client secret and add it to your Clerk app.
  1. Save the new client secret's **Value** somewhere secure. You'll add this and your client ID to your Clerk app later. Keep this page open.

  ### Set the Client ID and Client Secret in your Clerk Dashboard

  Go back to the Clerk Dashboard, where the modal should still be open, and paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values into the respective fields. Note that if you have any other Microsoft EASIE connections or a [Microsoft social connection](docs/authentication/social-connections/microsoft), this will update the credentials for all of them. Select **Add connection**.

  ### Enable OpenID

  To connect your Clerk app to your Microsoft app, set the **Redirect URI** in your Microsoft Azure portal.

  1. Navigate back to the Microsoft Azure portal.
  1. In the sidebar, open the **Manage** dropdown and select **Authentication**.
  1. Select **Add a platform**.
  1. Select **Web**.
  1. In the **Redirect URIs** field and the **Front-channel logout URL** field, paste the **Redirect URI** you copied from the Clerk Dashboard.
  1. Under **Implicit grant and hybrid flows**, check both **Access tokens** and **ID tokens**.
  1. Select **Configure** to save the changes.
