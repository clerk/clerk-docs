title: '`getAuth()`'
description: The getAuth() helper retrieves authentication state from the request object.
sdk: nextjs
---

The `getAuth()` helper retrieves authentication state from the request object.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using App Router, use the [`auth()` helper](/docs/reference/nextjs/app-router/auth) instead.

## Parameters

<Properties>
  - `req`

  The Next.js request object.

  ---

  - `opts?`

  An optional object that can be used to configure the behavior of the `getAuth()` function. It accepts the following properties:

  - `secretKey?`: A string that represents the Secret Key used to sign the session token. If not provided, the Secret Key is retrieved from the environment variable `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`.
</Properties>

## Returns

`getAuth()` returns the `Auth` object. See the [`Auth` reference](/docs/reference/backend/types/auth-object) for more information.

## Usage

The following example uses `getAuth()` to protect a route and load the user's data. If the user is authenticated, their `userId` is passed to [`clerkClient.users.getUser()`](/docs/reference/backend/user/get-user){{ target: '_blank' }} to get the current user's [`User`](/docs/reference/javascript/user){{ target: '_blank' }} object. If not authenticated, the request is rejected with a `401` status code.

See more detailed examples in the [dedicated guide](/docs/nextjs/guides/users/reading#pages-router).
