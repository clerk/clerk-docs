The `ClerkTheme` is used to customize the appearance of Clerk iOS components by adjusting colors, fonts, and design properties. It provides a comprehensive theming system that allows you to create a consistent visual experience across all Clerk components.

## Structure

## Usage

You can customize Clerk iOS components by creating a `ClerkTheme` and applying it to the SwiftUI environment.

### Apply a custom theme to all Clerk components

To customize all Clerk components in your app, create a `ClerkTheme` and apply it to your root view using the environment.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Clerk

struct MyApp: App {
  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      ContentView()
        .environment(\.clerkTheme, customTheme)
    }
  }

  let customTheme = ClerkTheme(
    colors: .init(
      primary: .blue,
    ),
    design: .init(
      borderRadius: 12.0
    )
  ) 
}
```

### Apply a theme to specific components

You can apply a theme to specific Clerk components by using the environment modifier on individual views. The theme used here will apply to all children of this view.

```swift
struct SignInView: View {
  var body: some View {
    AuthView()
      .environment(\.clerkTheme, customTheme)
  }

  let customTheme = ClerkTheme(
    colors: .init(
      primary: .purple,
    )
  )
}
```

### Adjust a specific property of the theme

You can adjust a specific property of the theme by modifying a single property.

```swift
struct SignInView: View {
  var body: some View {
    AuthView()
      .environment(\.clerkTheme.colors.primary, .green)
  }
}
```

### Custom fonts

You can customize fonts by providing a font family name or individual font specifications.

#### Using a font family name

```swift
struct CustomFontView: View {
  var body: some View {
    AuthView()
      .environment(\.clerkTheme, customTheme)
  }

  let customTheme = ClerkTheme(
    fonts: .init(fontFamily: "Helvetica Neue")
  )
}
```

#### Using individual font specifications

```swift
struct CustomFontView: View {
  var body: some View {
    AuthView()
      .environment(\.clerkTheme, customTheme)
  }

  let customTheme = ClerkTheme(
    fonts: .init(
      largeTitle: .init(name: "Helvetica Neue", size: 34.0),
      title: .init(name: "Helvetica Neue", size: 28.0),
      title2: .init(name: "Helvetica Neue", size: 22.0),
      title3: .init(name: "Helvetica Neue", size: 20.0),
      headline: .init(name: "Helvetica Neue", size: 18.0),
    )
  )
}
```

## Light and Dark Mode Support

Clerk iOS components automatically support both light and dark mode appearance, adapting seamlessly to the user's system preferences.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '20px', alignItems: 'flex-start' }}>
  ![Light Mode](/docs/images/ui-components/ios-user-profile-view.png){{ style: { maxWidth: '230px' } }}
  ![Dark Mode](/docs/images/ui-components/ios-user-profile-view-dark.png){{ style: { maxWidth: '230px' } }}
</div>

### Using Asset Catalog Colors

For more sophisticated appearance support, create colors in your Asset Catalog with separate light and dark variants:

```swift
extension ClerkTheme {
  static let brandTheme = ClerkTheme(
    colors: .init(
      primary: Color(.brandPrimary), // Asset with light/dark variants
      background: Color(.brandBackground),
      foreground: Color(.brandText),
      danger: Color(.brandDanger)
    )
  )
}
```

If Clerk's prebuilt theming doesn't meet your specific needs, you can create completely custom authentication flows using the Clerk API. For more information, see the [custom flow guides](/docs/guides/development/custom-flows/overview).
