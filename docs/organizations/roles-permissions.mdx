Clerk supports modeling your own custom role and permissions to control access to resources within your application when you use [organizations](/docs/organizations/overview).

## Roles

Roles determine a user's level of access to the organization. You can extend a role's privileges and access to resources by adding [permissions](#permissions).

### Default roles

For each instance, there are currently two default roles:

- **Admin (`org:admin`)** - Offers full access to organization resources. Members with the admin role have all the [System Permissions](#system-permissions). They can fully manage the organization and organization memberships.
- **Member (`org:member`)** - Offers limited access to organization resources. Access to organization resources is limited to the "Read members" permission only, by default. They cannot manage the organization and organization memberships, but they can view information about other members in it.

> [!NOTE]
> If you enabled organizations for your application before December 2023, the **Admin** role is `admin` and the **Member** role is `basic_member`, instead of `org:admin` and `org:member`, respectively.

### Custom role

You can create up to 10 custom organization roles per application instance to meet your application needs. If you need more than 10 roles, [contact support](/contact/support){{ target: '_blank' }}.

Custom roles can be granted permissions and access. For example, you can create a new role of **Billing** (`org:billing`) which can be used to group users who belong to a specific department of the organization and have permission to manage credit card information, invoices, and other resources related to billing.

To learn more about creating custom roles, see the [Create roles and permissions](/docs/organizations/create-roles-permissions) guide.

### The Default role for members

The **Default** role for members is the role that users are initially assigned as a new organization member. Initially, this role is the **Member** (`org:member`) role. This is the role that is used as a pre-filled default for invitations in `<OrganizationProfile />` and for organization enrollment with [verified domains](/docs/organizations/verified-domains).

> [!WARNING]
> You can't delete a role if it's used as the organization's **Default** role. However, you can [reassign the **Default** role to another role](/docs/organizations/default-role).

### The **Creator** role

When a user creates a new organization, that user is automatically added as the organization's first member and is assigned the **Creator** role. By default, **Admin** (`org:admin`) is the **Creator** role.

> [!WARNING]
> You can't delete a role if it's used as the organization's **Creator** role. However, you can [reassign the **Creator** role to another role](/docs/organizations/creator-role).

## Permissions

Permissions grant users privileged access to resources and operations, like creating and deleting. Clerk supports two types of permissions: System and Custom.

### System permissions

Clerk provides a set of system permissions that power [Clerk's Frontend API](/docs/reference/frontend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} and [organization-related Clerk components](/docs/components/overview). These permissions serve as the baseline required for Clerk to operate effectively.

Clerk's system permissions consist of the following:

- Manage organization (`org:sys_profile:manage`)
- Delete organization (`org:sys_profile:delete`)
- Read members (`org:sys_memberships:read`)
- Manage members (`org:sys_memberships:manage`)
- Read domains (`org:sys_domains:read`)
- Manage domains (`org:sys_domains:manage`)
- Read billing (`org:sys_billing:read`)
- Manage billing (`org:sys_billing:manage`)

You can assign these system permissions to any role.

> [!WARNING]
> System permissions aren't included in [session claims](/docs/backend-requests/resources/session-tokens#default-claims). To check permissions on the server-side, you must [create custom permissions](/docs/organizations/create-roles-permissions).

### Custom permissions

When creating a new permission, follow the format `org:<feature>:<permission>`. You can then assign the permission to an existing role.

For example, you could create a new permission called **Create invoices** (`org:invoices:create`) which allows only users with this permission to edit invoices. Then, you could assign this permission to a role, or multiple roles, such as **Billing** (`org:billing`) or **Sales** (`org:sales`).

To learn more about creating custom permissions, see the [Create roles and permissions](/docs/organizations/create-roles-permissions) guide.

## Verify a user's role or permission

To perform authorization checks on a user's role or permission, see the [guide on verifying if a user is authorized](/docs/guides/authorization-checks).
