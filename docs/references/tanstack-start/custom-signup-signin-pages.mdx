title: Build your own sign-in and sign-up pages for your TanStack Start app with Clerk
description: Learn how to add custom sign-in and sign-up pages to your TanStack Start app with Clerk's prebuilt components.
---

This guide shows you how to use the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) and [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) components with the [TanStack Router Catch-All Routes](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/code-based-routing#splat--catch-all-routes) in order to build custom sign-in and sign-up pages for your TanStack Start app.

If Clerk's prebuilt components don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the logic, you can rebuild the existing Clerk flows using the Clerk API. For more information, check out the [custom flows](/docs/custom-flows/overview) guides.

<Steps>
  ## Build a sign-up page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignUp />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-up) component.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-up.$.tsx' }}
  import { SignUp } from '@clerk/tanstack-start'
  import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/sign-up/$')({
    component: Page,
  })

  function Page() {
    return <SignUp />
  }
  ```

  ## Build a sign-in page

  The following example demonstrates how to render the [`<SignIn />`](/docs/components/authentication/sign-in) component.

  ```tsx {{ filename: 'app/routes/sign-in.$.tsx' }}
  import { SignIn } from '@clerk/tanstack-start'
  import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

  export const Route = createFileRoute('/sign-in/$')({
    component: Page,
  })

  function Page() {
    return <SignIn />
  }
  ```

  ## Configure your sign-up and sign-in pages

  To tell Clerk where to find your sign-in and sign-up pages, set the following [environment variables](/docs/deployments/clerk-environment-variables#sign-in-and-sign-up-redirects):

  ```env {{ filename: '.env' }}
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
  CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
  CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
  CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
  ```

  ## Visit your new pages

  Run your project with the following command:

  <CodeBlockTabs type="installer" options={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash {{ filename: 'terminal' }}
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </CodeBlockTabs>

  Visit your new custom pages locally at [localhost:3000/sign-in](http://localhost:3000/sign-in) and [localhost:3000/sign-up](http://localhost:3000/sign-up).
