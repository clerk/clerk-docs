First, understand that the `useSignUp()` hook returns an object with the following properties:

- `signUp`: The [`SignUpFuture`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-up-future) object. Use this to initiate the sign-up process and check the current state of the sign-up attempt.
- `errors`: The [`Errors`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/errors) object that contains the errors that occurred during the last API request. You can use this to display errors to the user in your custom UI.
- `fetchStatus`: The fetch status of the underlying [`SignUpFuture`](/docs/reference/javascript/sign-up-future) resource. You can use this to display a loading state or disable buttons while the request is in progress.
