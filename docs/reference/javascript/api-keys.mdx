The `APIKeys` object provides methods for managing API keys that allow your application's users to grant third-party services programmatic access to your application's API endpoints on their behalf. API keys are long-lived, opaque tokens that can be instantly revoked.

To use these methods, you must access them through the `Clerk` object: `clerk.apiKeys`.

> [!NOTE]
> If a `subject` parameter is not provided, the methods will automatically use the [Active Organization](!active-organization) ID if available, otherwise they will use the current User ID.

## Methods

### `getAll()`

Retrieves a paginated list of API keys for the current user or organization. Returns a [`ClerkPaginatedResponse`][pag-ref] of [`APIKeyResource`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/api-key) objects.

```typescript
function getAll(params?: GetAPIKeysParams): Promise<ClerkPaginatedResponse<APIKeyResource>>
```

#### `GetAPIKeysParams`

<Properties>
  - `subject?`
  - `string`

  The user or organization ID to query API keys by. If not provided, defaults to the [Active Organization](!active-organization), then the current User.

  ---

  - `query?`
  - `string`

  A search query to filter API keys by name.

  ---

  - `initialPage?`
  - `number`

  A number that can be used to skip the first n-1 pages. For example, if `initialPage` is set to 10, it will skip the first 9 pages and will fetch the 10th page.

  ---

  - `pageSize?`
  - `number`

  A number that indicates the maximum number of results that should be returned for a specific page.
</Properties>

#### Example

```js
await clerk.apiKeys.getAll()
```

### `create()`

Creates a new API key. Returns an [`APIKeyResource`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/api-key) object that includes the `secret` property. **The secret is only available in the response from `create()` and cannot be retrieved later.**

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to store the API key secret immediately after creation, as it will not be available again.

```typescript
function create(params: CreateAPIKeyParams): Promise<APIKeyResource>
```

#### `CreateAPIKeyParams`

<Properties>
  - `name`
  - `string`

  The name of the API key.

  ---

  - `subject?`
  - `string`

  The user or organization ID to associate the API key with. If not provided, defaults to the [Active Organization](!active-organization), then the current User.

  ---

  - `secondsUntilExpiration?`
  - `number | null`

  The number of seconds until the API key expires. Set to `null` or omit to create a key that never expires.

  ---

  - `description?`
  - `string | null`

  An optional description for the API key.
</Properties>

#### Example

```js
const apiKey = await clerk.apiKeys.create({
  name: 'My API Key',
  secondsUntilExpiration: 86400, // 24 hours
  description: 'API key for third-party service',
})

// Store the secret immediately
console.log('API Key Secret:', apiKey.secret)
```

### `revoke()`

Revokes an API key by ID. Returns an [`APIKeyResource`](/docs/reference/javascript/types/api-key) object.

```typescript
function revoke(params: RevokeAPIKeyParams): Promise<APIKeyResource>
```

#### `RevokeAPIKeyParams`

<Properties>
  - `apiKeyID`
  - `string`

  The ID of the API key to revoke.

  ---

  - `revocationReason?`
  - `string | null`

  An optional reason for revoking the API key.
</Properties>

#### Example

```js
await clerk.apiKeys.revoke({
  apiKeyID: 'ak_xxx',
  revocationReason: 'No longer needed',
})
```
