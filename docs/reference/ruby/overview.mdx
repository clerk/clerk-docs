The Clerk Ruby SDK provides a powerful set of tools and utilities to seamlessly integrate authentication, user management, and Organization management into your Ruby application.

To get started, refer to the appropriate guide:

- [Vanilla Ruby](/docs/ruby/getting-started/quickstart)
- [Rails](/docs/reference/ruby/rails)
- [Rack](/docs/reference/ruby/rack)
- [Sinatra](/docs/reference/ruby/sinatra)

## Available environment variables

The Ruby SDK supports the following environment variables:

| Variable name | Usage |
| - | - |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | The Secret Key of your instance **(required)** |
| `CLERK_API_BASE` | Overrides the default API base URL: `https://api.clerk.com/v1/` |
| `CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` | Rails view helper: `clerk_sign_in_url` |
| `CLERK_SIGN_IN_UP` | Rails view helper: `clerk_sign_up_url` |
| `CLERK_USER_PROFILE_URL` | Rails view helper: `clerk_user_profile_url` |

## Available methods

All available methods are listed in the [Ruby HTTP Client documentation](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-http-client-ruby/tree/main/.generated#documentation-for-api-endpoints){{ target: '_blank' }}. The Ruby HTTP Client is a generated wrapper around the [Backend API](/docs/reference/backend-api){{ target: '_blank' }} that provides a more Ruby-friendly interface.

### Reverification

The reverification feature provides an additional layer of security by requiring users to reverify their session before accessing sensitive routes. By default, it is set to `STRICT`, but accepts the following presets:

- `Clerk::StepUp::Preset::LAX`: Authenticated within the past day, requiring the second factor
- `Clerk::StepUp::Preset::MODERATE`: Authenticated within the past hour, requiring the second factor
- `Clerk::StepUp::Preset::STRICT`: Authenticated within the past 10 minutes, requiring the second factor
- `Clerk::StepUp::Preset::STRICT_MFA`: Authenticated within the past 10 minutes, requiring both first and second factors
