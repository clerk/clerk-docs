**Second factor verification**, also known as two-factor authentication (2FA) or [multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/docs/guides/configure/auth-strategies/sign-up-sign-in-options#multi-factor-authentication), is the process of verifying a user's identity using an additional factor. For example, if a user signs in with their email and password, and then, is asked to also provide an [OTP](!otp) sent to their phone number, the OTP is the [second factor](!second-factor).
