# Build a custom sign-out flow

<Callout type="danger">
  Clerk's [Account Portal pages](/docs/account-portal/overview) and [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) handle the entire sign out flow out of the box. This guide is for users who want to build a custom user interface using the Clerk API.
</Callout>

Clerk's [`<UserButton />`](/docs/components/user/user-button) and [`<SignOutButton />`](/docs/components/unstyled/sign-out-button) components provide a way to sign out users, out of the box. However, if you are building a custom solution, you can use the [`signOut()`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk#sign-out) function to sign out users.

The `signOut()` function signs a user out of all sessions in a [multi-session application](/docs/custom-flows/multi-session-applications), or simply the current session in a single-session context. You can also specify a specific session to sign out by passing the `sessionId` parameter.

Please note that the sign-out flow only deactivates the current session. Other valid sessions corresponding to the same user (for example, if the user is signed in on another computer) will continue to work.

The [`useClerk()`](/docs/references/react/use-clerk) hook is used to access the `signOut()` function, which is then called when the user clicks the sign-out button.

The Next.js [`useRouter()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/router#userouter) hook is used to redirect the user to the home page after they sign out.
```jsx
'use client'

import { useClerk } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

// Import this component where you want to display a sign-out button
const SignOutButton = () => {
  const { signOut } = useClerk();
  const router = useRouter()

  return (
    // Clicking on this button will sign out a user and reroute them to the "/" (home) page.
    <button onClick={() => signOut(() => router.push("/"))}>
      Sign out
    </button>
  );
};
```
</Tab>

{/* TODO (Roy): Use CodeBlockTabs and add example for NPM Module vs window.Clerk (Script) - see the /docs/components/user-button update I did in this PR */}
```js
// Signs-out the current user.
await window.Clerk.signOut();
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
