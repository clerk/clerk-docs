description: An overview of the differences between Development and Production instances
---

# Environments / Instances
When creating a new application within Clerk, you are provided with two instances: `Development` and `Production`.  These instances vary slightly and should only be used appropriately.

## Development instance
A `Development` instance is Clerk's default instance type and has characteristics that allow it to be more useful for local development. To facilitate development and local authentication, `Development` instances have a more relaxed security posture and are not suitable for production workloads.

Some notable examples of `Development`-only characteristics are: 
- A `Development` banner is shown prominently in the Clerk Dashboard to make clear you're managing or configuring non-production data
- Email and SMS templates are prefixed with the environment type to prevent against using `Development` instances for production purposes
- Some social connections use shared credentials by default 
- Certain functionality, like bot protection, is only available in `Production` mode
- [The Account Portal](/docs/account-portal/overview) will use a Clerk development domain that ends with `accounts.dev` instead of your app's production domain
- OAuth consent screens will show the development domain that ends with `accounts.dev` instead of your production domain
- Search engines will not be able to crawl and index your application
- Development instances have a 500 users cap and user data can not be transferred between instances

<Callout type="info">
  All paid functionality is available in a `Development` instance. However, when you deploy your application to `Production`, you will be asked to upgrade to a `Pro` account. See [our pricing page](/pricing) for full details.

## Production instance
A `Production` instance is the more robust option of Clerk's instance types. `Production` instances are meant to support high volumes of traffic and by default, have a more strict security posture.

Some notable differences between `Production` and `Development` instances are: 
- You must associate a production domain within the Clerk Dashboard
- You are required to provision your own SSO credentials 

When deploying to production, you must first activate your `Production` environment. Check out Clerk's [Deploying to Production](/docs/deployments/overview#deploying-to-production) guide to learn about the process and avoid common pitfalls.
