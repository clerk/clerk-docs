# Session methods

These are all methods on the [`Clerk`](/docs/references/javascript/clerk/clerk) class that help you manage the active session and organization.

## `setActive()`

A method used to set the active session or organization, or both.

```typescript
function setActive({
  session,
  organization,
  beforeEmit,
}: SetActiveParams): Promise<void>;
```

### `SetActiveParams`

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `session?` | [`Session`][session-ref] \| `string` \| `null` | The session resource or session ID (string version) to be set as active. If `null`, the current session is deleted. |
| `organization?` | [`Organization`](/docs/references/javascript/organization/organization) \| `string` \| `null` | The organization resource or organization ID (string version) to be set as active in the current session. If `null`, the currently active organization is removed as active. |
| `beforeEmit?` | `(session?: Session \| null) => void \| Promise<any>` | Callback run just before the active session and/or organization is set to the passed object. Can be used to hook up for pre-navigation actions. |

### `setActive()` returns

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Promise<void>` | The `Promise` will resolve after the passed `session` or `organization` is set. |
