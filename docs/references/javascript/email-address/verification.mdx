# `EmailAddress` Verification

These are all methods on [the `EmailAddress` class](/docs/references/javascript/email-address/email-address) that allow you to verify a user's email address.

## `prepareVerification()`

```typescript
function prepareVerification(params: PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<EmailAddress>;
```

Kick off the verification process for this email address. An email message with a one-time code or a magic-link will be sent to the email address box.

### `PrepareEmailAddressVerificationParams`

<Tables
  headings={["Name", "Type", "Description"]}
  headingsMeta={[{}, {maxWidth: "300px"}, {maxWidth: "300px"}]}
  rows={[
    {cells: [<code>strategy </code>, <code>string</code>, <>
    The verification strategy. Possible strategy values are:
    <ul>
    <li><strong><code>email_link</code></strong>:  User will receive an email magic link via email.</li>
    <li><strong><code>email_code</code></strong>: User will receive a one-time authentication code via email.</li>
    </ul>
    </>]},
    {cells: [<code>redirectUrl</code>, <code>string | undefined</code>, <>The magic link target URL. Users will be redirected here once they click the magic link from their email. This param only applies if <code>strategy</code> is <code>email_link</code></>]},
  ]}

## `attemptVerification()`

```typescript
function attemptVerification(params: AttemptEmailAddressVerificationParams): Promise<EmailAddress>;
