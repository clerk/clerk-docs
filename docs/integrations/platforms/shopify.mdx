</TutorialHero>

Integrating Shopify with Clerk gives you the benefits of using a Shopify store while leveraging Clerk's authentication, prebuilt components, and webhooks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using [your own identity provider for customer login](https://changelog.shopify.com/posts/use-your-own-identity-provider-for-customer-login) is available only to stores on the Shopify Plus plan

To make the setup process easier, it's recommended to keep two browser tabs open: one for the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) and one for your [Shopify admin](https://admin.shopify.com).

<Steps>
  ## Connect a new Shopify provider

  1. In your Shopify store **Settings**, navigate to **Customer accounts**.
  1. Select **Manage** on the **Identity provider**.
  1. Click **Connect to provider** in the top right corner, in order to create a new identity provider.
  1. You will be redirected to the provider page. Type a name for the **Identity provider name**, for example `Clerk`.

  ## Create a new Clerk OAuth application

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, navigate to the [**OAuth applications**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=/oauth-applications) page.
  1. Select **Add OAuth application**.
  1. Enter the **Name** of your new OAuth application, for example `Shopify provider`.
  1. For the **Scopes**, make sure to also select `openid`.
  1. Click **Add**. You will be presented with the **Client Secret** and we have to select **Copy secret**.
  1. You'll be redirected to the **OAuth application** page.

  ## Complete the configuration across Clerk and Shopify

  1. Navigate back to the **Shopify admin** tab.
  1. Paste the Client Secret which you previously copied from Clerk Dashboard to the **Client secret** field.
  1. Go back to Clerk Dashboard, copy the **Client ID** and paste it to the corresponding **Shopify admin** field.
  1. On the Clerk Dashboard, copy the **Discovery URL** at the bottom and paste it to the **Well-known or discovery endpoint URL** field on the **Shopify admin**.
  1. For the **Additional scopes** on the **Shopify admin** also type the `profile` scope.
  1. For the **Post-logout redirect URI parameter name** on the **Shopify admin** use the `returnTo` parameter name.
  1. Click **Save**, at the top of the page, to update your configuration.
  1. At the top right, click **Activate**, to enable your new Shopify identity provider.
  1. Finally, copy the **Callback URL** from the **Shopify admin** and go back to the Clerk Dashboard tab in order to paste it to the **Redirect URIs**.
  1. At the bottom, click **Save** and you are ready to go!

  ## Finished!

  You now have a fully functioning Shopify store with Clerk authentication, where you can leverage all of the Clerk features that we offer out of the box, improving your user management and the insights of your store.
