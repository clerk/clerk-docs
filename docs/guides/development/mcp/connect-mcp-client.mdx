This guide demonstrates how to connect an MCP-compatible client (**LLM app**), like Cursor, to an MCP server. It assumes that you have already built an MCP server in your application with Clerk by following the guide on [building an MCP server](/docs/guides/development/mcp/build-mcp-server).

## Connect your client LLM to your MCP server

To complete the integration, you'll need to connect an MCP-compatible client to your MCP server. Each client has a different way of connecting to MCP servers, and given that the MCP spec is still in development, you may need to refer to the client's documentation for the most up-to-date instructions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For most client implementations of MCP, [dynamic client registration](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) is required. This allows MCP-compatible clients to automatically register themselves with your server during the OAuth flow.
> Before proceeding, ensure you have toggled on the **Dynamic client registration** option in the [OAuth Applications](https://dashboard.clerk.com/~/oauth-applications) page in the Clerk Dashboard.

### Development vs. Production Setup

- **Development**: Start your MCP server by running `npm run dev` and use `http://localhost:3000/mcp` as your server URL.
- **Production**: Use your deployed URL (e.g. `https://your-domain.com/mcp`) for security and proper functionality.
  > [!WARNING]
  > Always use HTTPS URLs in production environments. HTTP connections are not secure and may not work with all MCP clients.

    ### Connecting Cursor to your MCP server

    1. Navigate to **Cursor Settings**. To find this, open the **Command Palette** (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`) and search for **Cursor Settings**, or select the gear icon in the top right corner of the app.
    1. In the sidenav, select **Tools & Integrations**. If you don't see this, you may need to update Cursor to the latest version.
    1. Click the **New MCP Server** button, which will open up a new tab with the MCP configuration JSON file.
    1. Add the following configuration to the JSON file:

    ```json
    { "mcpServers": { "clerk-mcp-server": { "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp" } } }
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Replace `http://localhost:3000/mcp` with your production URL if you've deployed your MCP server.

    5. Select the **Needs login** option when it loads. You'll be redirected to a Clerk OAuth consent screen to authorize Cursor to access your user data.
    5. Select **Allow**. Once authorized, your tool(s) should be listed as enabled and you should see a green active status.
    5. Start a new chat in [**Agent Mode**](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/agent) and prompt it to fetch your Clerk user data (e.g., "What is my Clerk user data?").
    5. Select the **Run tool** option once it becomes available.

    You've now successfully connected **Cursor** to your MCP server and authenticated it using Clerk.

## Expected Response Format

When you successfully connect and authenticate your MCP client, prompting for your Clerk user data should return information similar to:

```yaml
User ID: <user-id>
Username: <username>
First Name: <first-name>
Last Name: <last-name>
Primary Email: <primary-email>
Secondary Email: <secondary-email>
2FA Enabled: No
Account Banned: No
Account Locked: No
Profile Image: <profile-image>
External Accounts: <external-account>
Organization Creation Enabled: Yes
Delete Self Enabled: Yes
```

The exact response will vary based on your specific Clerk user profile and the prompt you use with your LLM client.

## Not Currently Supported

The MCP protocol and spec are still in development, and as a result, implementation across clients can vary. While we are working to support all clients, there are some clients that are not currently supported:

- **Cline**: While it does have MCP support, their implementation is not compatible with the latest MCP spec.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues connecting your MCP client:

1. **Authentication fails**: Ensure **Dynamic client registration** is enabled in your Clerk OAuth Applications settings.
1. **Connection refused**: Verify your MCP server is running and accessible at the specified URL.
1. **HTTPS errors**: Make sure you're using HTTPS URLs in production environments.
1. **Tool not available**: Confirm your client displays the tool in the list of available tools, and that the tool has been properly implemented.
