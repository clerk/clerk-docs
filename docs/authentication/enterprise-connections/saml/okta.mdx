## Tutorial

<Steps>
  ### Set up an enterprise connection in Clerk

  To create a SAML connection in Clerk:

  1. Navigate to the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections).
  1. In the top navigation, select **Configure**. Then in the sidebar, select **SSO Connections**.
  1. Select the **Add connection** button, and select **For specific domains**.
  1. Select **Okta Workforce** as the identity provider.
  1. Add the **Name** of the connection. This is the name that will be displayed in the sign-in form.
  1. Add the **Specific Domain** that you want to allow this connection for. This is the domain of the users you want to allow to sign in to your application.
  1. Select **Add connection**. You will be redirected to the connection's configuration page.
  1. Find the **Service Provider Configuration** section.
  1. Save the **Single sign-on URL** and the **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)** values somewhere secure. You'll need these in the [Configure your service provider](#configure-your-service-provider) step.
  1. Leave this page open.

  ### Create a new enterprise application in Okta

  To create a new enterprise application in Okta:

  1. Navigate to [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) and sign in.
  1. In the Okta dashboard, select **Admin** in the top right corner.
  1. In the navigation sidebar, select the **Applications** dropdown and select **Applications**.
  1. Select the **Create App Integration** button.
  1. In the **Create a new app integration** modal, select the **SAML 2.0** option and select the **Next** button.
  1. Once redirected to the **Create SAML Integration** page, fill in the **General Settings** fields. An **App name** is required.
  1. Select the **Next** button to continue.

  ### Configure your service provider

  Once you have moved forward from the **General Settings** instructions, you will be presented with the **Configure SAML** page.

  To configure your service provider (Clerk), you must add these two fields to your IdP's application:

  - **Single sign-on URL** - This is your application's URL that your IdP will redirect your users back to after they have authenticated in your IdP.
  - **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)** - This is a unique identifier for your SAML connection that your IdP application needs.

  To fill out the appropriate values for these fields:

  1. Paste the **Single sign-on URL** and the **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)** values that you saved earlier into their respective fields.

  ### Map Okta claims to Clerk attributes

  Mapping the claims in your IdP to the attributes in Clerk ensures that the data from your IdP is correctly mapped to the data in Clerk.

  | Clerk attribute | Okta claim |
  | - | - |
  | `mail` | `user.email` |
  | `firstName` | `user.firstName` |
  | `lastName` | `user.lastName` |

  1. In the Okta dashboard, find the **Attribute Statements (optional)** section.
  1. For the **Name** field, enter `mail`.
  1. For the **Value** field, choose `user.email` from the dropdown.
  1. Select the **Add Another** button to add another attribute.
  1. For the **Name** field, enter `firstName`.
  1. For the **Value** field, choose `user.firstName` from the dropdown.
  1. Select the **Add Another** button to add another attribute.
  1. For the **Name** field, enter `lastName`.
  1. For the **Value** field, choose `user.lastName` from the dropdown.
  1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the **Next** button to continue.
  1. You will be redirected to the **Feedback** page. Fill out the feedback however you would like and select the **Finish** button to complete the setup.

  ### Assign selected user or group in Okta

  You need to assign your users/user groups to your enterprise application. For example, if you were part of the Clerk organization, you would have access to users and groups in the Clerk organization. In this case, you could assign one or more users or entire groups to the enterprise application you just created.

  1. In the Okta dashboard, select the **Assignments** tab.
  1. Select the **Assign** dropdown. You can either select **Assign to people** or **Assign to groups**.
  1. In the search field, enter the user or group of users that you want to assign to the enterprise application.
  1. Select the **Assign** button next to the user or group that you want to assign.
  1. Select the **Done** button to complete the assignment.

  ### Configure your identity provider

  Once you have completed the setup in Okta, you will be redirected to the application instances page with the **Sign On** tab selected.

  1. Under **Sign on methods**, copy the **Metadata URL**.
  1. Navigate back to the Clerk Dashboard and find the **Identity Provider configuration** section.
  1. Under the **Metadata configuration** option, paste the **Metadata URL**.
  1. Select the **Fetch & save** button to complete the setup.

  ### Enable the connection for Clerk

  To make the connection available for your users to authenticate with:

  1. In the Clerk Dashboard, you should still have the connection's configuration page open. If not, navigate to the [**SSO Connections**](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=user-authentication/sso-connections) page and select the connection.
  1. Toggle on **Enable connection** and select **Save**.
